Kaplan Professional Schools supports the effort to increase standards in the appraisal profession, and we will work closely with the Appraiser Qualifications Board to develop the courses that will assist new and experienced appraisers to understand the ethical guidelines of their profession - and to help them work within those guidelines, said Josh Levenson, President of Kaplan Professional Schools.
In the past year, Kaplan Professional Schools has seen an increase of nearly 10% in appraisal training. According to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2004, appraisers and assessors of real estate held about 102,000 jobs. According to the Bureau, the employment of appraisers and assessors of real estate is expected to grow faster than the average from 200414.
Real estate appraisal is a highly regulated industry with strict standards of practice and ethics. Substantial fines are given for those who do not follow the rules. But the high salaries and flexible schedules continue to make appraisal an attractive career. While there is broad speculation about the real estate bubble bursting, appraisers are not as affected by a downturn. Home refinances, home improvement loans and other transactions require the continued services of an appraiser. In addition, the small number of appraisers in some regions makes room for new professionals.
The process for becoming an appraiser varies in each state, depending upon the level of appraiser. The cost ranges from $249 to $1,239 for exam preparation and test fees. The current education requirements range from 75-120 hours. However, one of the most challenging aspects about becoming certified is the required 2,000-2,500 hours of appraising experience over a 24-30 month time period. Candidates must find an experienced appraiser who will mentor, train and compensate them for their work.
Kaplan Professional Schools Appraiser Training Programs include training and continuing education for trainee appraisers, licensed appraisers, certified residential appraisers and certified general appraisers.
Classes are being conducted at schools across the country in preparation for the large number of people seeking an appraisal licensing before the requirements increase in 2008.
