Written by Paul Bradshaw -
Here’s the digest of all my tweets from the Investigative Journalism Goes Global conference, typos and all (corrections welcomed). It’s reverse-chronological order, so the first tweets are at the bottom:
Peter: it’s never going to be a money spinner; it’s produced because of gaining reputation 05:05 PM

If you have exclusive content then people will be prepared to pay for it. 04:50 PM

One way is to reduce cost of journalism. Citizen Journalism being one way. 04:48 PM
IJ has adapted forms from other types of reporting, e.g. celebrity. 04:48 PM
Ask: What are the structures of power here? How do they affect the truth? 04:47 PM
Paul Dwyer, sr lecturer in media management: disagrees that it’s because journos lack understanding of powers of state 04:47 PM
Solution is to encourage trainee journalists to interrogate information, not simply accept it from the internet. 04:43 PM
News employers are looking at self preservation. How do we create level of interrogation to give us room for manoeuvre? 04:43 PM
Ed: it’s a nostalgia. The issue is not to whinge but to engage with how we reformulate our activities or restructure to address it. 04:43 PM

First story received widespread coverage because it was released by army; the second little because it wasn’t. 04:35 PM
Two incidents in Baghdad. In one 15 men found dead in van; in another dozen women and children found dead 04:33 PM
Where we’re trying to put out statements of fact, the idea that we should keep balancing is lethal to our objective of telling the truth 04:30 PM
Notion of objectivity is utterly bogus. 04:30 PM
Secondly, way commercialism filters through to journalists at their desks - objectivity turns out to be mere neutrality. 04:29 PM
“So we end up doing churnalism. Censorship by omission, as talked about this morning 04:28 PM John Pilger
“Commercialism invading the structures of news organisations. They’ve stripped out editorial staff and increase outputs. 04:28 PM
