History Matching Process Transplant Process Myths
Researchers began experimenting with organ transplantation on animals and humans in the 18th century. Over the years, scientists have experienced many failures, but by the mid-20th century, they were performing successful organ transplants. Transplants of kidneys, livers, hearts, pancreata, intestine, lungs, and heart-lungs are now considered routine medical treatment.
In the last 20 years, important medical breakthroughs such as tissue typing and immunosuppressant drugs have allowed for a larger number of organ transplants and a longer survival rate for transplant recipients. The most notable development in this area was Jean Borel's discovery of an immunosuppressant drug called Cyclosporine in the mid-1970s. This drug was approved for commercial use in November 1983.
Unfortunately, the need for organ transplants continues to exceed the supply of organs. But as medical technology improves and more donors become available, the number of people who live longer and healthier lives continues to increase each year.
