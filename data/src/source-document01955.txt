Careers in Nonproliferation
The Nonproliferation Graduate Program (NGP) is a full-time graduate program for students interested in exploring a career in nuclear nonproliferation. The program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA's) Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and administered by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
The mission of the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) is to detect, prevent, and reverse the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while mitigating the risks from nuclear operations.
In support of this mission, NGP fellows are assigned to a specific DNN program office. Working with select supervisors and mentors, NGP fellows assist with programs that involve

Nonproliferation Graduate Program Objectives
NGP objectives are to
promote awareness of careers in nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and U.S. national laboratories
provide participants with specialized training and valuable practical experience in the field of nonproliferation
aid NNSA in achieving its mission
develop a talent pool that can assist NNSA with its international security and nonproliferation programs.
This program is a perfect complement to my academic career because it adds invaluable practical and professional experience on policy formation (from concept to implementation), U.S. foreign policy, and international relations to my academic work. Further, my academic experiences have prepared me to try to apply theoretical models of international relations and nonproliferation to real-world situations, with varied results.
