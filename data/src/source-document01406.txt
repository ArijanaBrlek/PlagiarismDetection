The Brazilian Flag
Brazil's flag is symbolic of numerous historical, cultural, political and philosophical factors. It is a forest green with an horizontal yellow diamond enclosing a night blue orb representing the starry night sky of the Southern Hemisphere. The sky includes 27 five pointed, white starsne for each of Brazil's and one for the Federal District (capitol) of Bras√≠lia. The stars reflect the star pattern of the night sky over Rio de Janeiro on November 15, 1889, the date the Brazilian republic was proclaimed. The stars are representative of the Southern Cross, Scorpio, Canis Major and others in the Southern Hemisphere. The banner's motto reads (Order and Progress). This flag, adopted on May 11, 1992, is an adaptation of an earlier Brazilian flag dating from November 15, 1889.
