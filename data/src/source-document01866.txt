The official list of founders also includes a few members who were less active, namely:  Jean Coulomb, (1905-1979), René de Possel and Szolem Mandelbrojt (uncle and early mentor of the young , of future fame).

Opinions about Nicolas Bourbaki
The hope was that a fairly small simple set of basic structures were the basis of most research.  I think it is also true that for a while, this was generally believed.  But for the last 20 years, it has been increasingly doubted:  First because Bourbaki began to drown in its own need to be general enough, and they never could be sure when to stop  (e.g., before doing the reals, they need a general theory of topological fields).  Secondly, because math began to be driven by complex theories rather than simple ones  (e.g., the Langlands conjecture at the abstract end, control theory and probability at the applied end).  These theories don't benefit much from the Bourbaki.
