They've be happy to point you in the right direction. The drive from San Juan is on a modern toll highway and the style of driving is similar to any large metropolitan area in the mainland USA.  Note: most drivers in Puerto Rico do not use their directional signals - so don't be surprised if cars turn without notice.
