Measuring cups

For samller eye pillow: Cut out front and back pieces: Two 9" x 4".
SEWING
For each pillow: Pin front and back together, right sides facing.
Stitch around each pillow, leave opening on side for filling.
Trim corners. Turn each pillow right side out.
Use the funnel to fill pillows. Fill smaller eye pillow with 1 cup rice and 1/8 cup of lavender. Pin opening closed.
Fill larger pillow with microbeads. This can be messy, so you might want to do it outside. Put in as much as you like of the microbeads, and follow with 1/4 cup of lavender. Pin opening closed.
Stitch openings on both pillows closed securely.
You can chill these pillows in the fridge for a cooling feel on your neck, shoulders, or forehead. Or, for the rice-filled eye pillow ONLY, place in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm. Put in for 30 seconds more if it isn't warm enough. Works wonders for a headache! And makes you feel like a pampered princess! Especially if you use a natural silk fabric.
To personalize as a gift, write the name of the recipient on the pillow with fabric paint. Stack one pillow on top of the other, wrap a snazzy little ribbon around both of them...Sweet and chic!
