Preparations for a job interview
Research shows that a recruiter decides within fifteen seconds whether or not he is going to take you on. A bit of an exaggeration? Perhaps, but the first two to three minutes of an interview are crucial. Regardless of whether you have an impressive CV, it is important to know how you come across, how to present and sell yourself beforehand. Incidentally, no matter how sympathetic and skilled you may come across, if you do not know anything about the job or the company you will still look a bit of a fool. Sound preparation and self-confidence are the basis for a successful presentation and a smooth interview. Preparation and confidence are often closely related. Read here how you can prepare for a successful interview.Always prepare yourself
Bear in mind that the person you are having the interview with, does not know you and would like to get to find out more about you. In the limited amount of time he has available for the interview, he wants to find out what your strong points are and what kind of person you are. In order to be able to answer these question as well as possible, it is important for you to know what kind of person you are. This is why you should make a list of your good and bad points, your strengths and weaknesses. Weaknesses do not necessarily have to be bad. It is a good thing for people to be aware of their weaknesses! As long as you are able to say that you are aware of them and that you see it as a challenge to work on them. However, it is better not to mention some of your really weak points ('I am always late for work').Know yourself
Before you go for your interview it is a good thing to take another look at the details of the job that is advertised. What exactly is expected of you and what could they be asking questions about. Think about which of your qualities link up well with the job description. If all is well, you already did this when you wrote your CV and your letter of application, but it does not hurt to take another look. Engross yourself in the company that you are going to be working for. You do not really need to know all the 'ins & outs', but it is appreciated if you are aware of some figures, the company mission statement, and the latest company news. You can often find this kind of information on the company's website. Nearly all self-respecting companies have a website nowadays. You will also find hundreds of company presentations on Monsterboard.nl. Take a close look at these and read what the company says about itself.Know the vacancy and the company
Make sure that you look smart for the interview. Of course, what is expected of you will differ from company to company and from job to job. But as a man you are rarely overdressed in a suit. Even if the company's dress code is fairly casual, it is generally appreciated if you turn up for an interview in a suit (and don't forget to polish your shoes!). A suit is not only smarter, but also adds charisma. Women have a bit more choice and do not necessarily have to go in a suit. However, they should make sure that they look smart and should not wear jeans. Whatever you do, do not wear anything that you do not feel comfortable wearing. You have to feel at ease. If you have to take some papers with you, put them in a smart bag or case. Do not put them in a plastic bag or rucksack.What are you going to wear?
You can only have a good interview if you are well prepared. Make sure that you have made all the necessary arrangements and that you are not going to have any nasty surprises. This will only distract you. Make sure that you leave home in plenty of time and that you know how to get to the company. There is nothing worse than having to rush through traffic to get somewhere. It only adds stress and you are going to need your energy for other things. You should always arrive on time. If you are late you will make a very bad first impression. Of course, the traffic may turn out to be really bad (there may have been an accident or a train may have been cancelled) but you should allow for average delays. You can expect to get stuck in traffic jams and should not assume that public transport is always on time. So make sure you allow plenty of time. It is better to be early than it is to be late. And if you are really early, you can always go for a walk around the area in which the company is situated. It will probably even help you relax! Take the telephone number of the company with you, so that you can call them if you think that you are going to be late despite all your efforts to be on time!Be on time!
TIP:
Stress is a very natural thing. It is important for you to realise this, because this is the only way that you are going to be able to deal with it effectively and perhaps even benefit from it. The consequences of stress are primary processes that can be traced back to survival in nature. If you as a mammal (and we are all mammals) are threatened you will want to do one of two things: fight or flee. Your body needs extra energy for this so-called 'fight-or-flight-reaction' and the stress in your body provides this. To fight or to flee you are going to need your arms and legs and this is why all the energy will flow to those skeleton muscles at such times. The muscles in your arms and legs will therefore become extra tense. This is why you often see the hands of people in stressful situations shake (e.g. when they are giving a presentation). The body takes that extra energy from other muscles and organs which it deems to be less important at that time. Your bladder will weaken, for instance, as a result of which you will feel the need to go to the toilet more quickly. More moisture is also extracted from your body, which explains why your mouth gets dry. If you want to be well prepared for an interview, and you know that you are going to be a bit stressed, you should bear in mind the above-mentioned points. Go to the toilet shortly before the interview and do not drink too much - especially not tea or coffee as these cause your body to lose even more moisture. You should therefore ask for a glass of water instead of a coffee during the interview. If your mouth gets dry you often cannot speak very clearly. This is particularly true for people who do not articulate very clearly anyway. However stress also provides extra adrenaline and increases your level of concentration which can actually help you in an interview. If you make allowance for the above-mentioned negative effects of stress, you can use the stress to your advantage. You will then be sure to have a good job interview.Coping with stress
