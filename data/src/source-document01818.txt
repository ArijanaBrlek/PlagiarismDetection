Get of acts you may not hear anywhere else. offers a married woman's view of life in our town. (If that's not enough for you, she writes erotic fiction too. Ah, now we have your attention.) considers our town 'behind enemy lines'. (Not sure how we feel about that.) probably sets the local standard for cool posts.

Count on Eric to show you things you haven't seen elsewhere. is a blog that looks at Hoboken and Jersey City from a Manhattan prism. (Seeing us as a 'Sixth Boro' is a sign of acceptance, folks.
