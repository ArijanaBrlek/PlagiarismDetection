Tutorial Instruction in all Academic Areas and at all Academic Levels
The Academic Preparation Center has helped thousands of students develop the confidence and skills necessary for academic success. Tutorial instruction is directed to students at all academic levels and includes:
Academic subjects: Math, Statistics, Natural Sciences, Social Studies, Literature, Modern and Ancient Languages, etc.
Preparation for the following standardized tests: SAT , New SAT, SAT , SSAT Subject Tests , PSAT/NMSQT /font>, ACT, , , , MCAT, TOEFL, PRAXIS, GED, ISEE, and other tests. GRE GMAT LSAT
Our method is based on the student's learning needs and goals. We begin with an analysis of the student's present state of learning. A profile is developed identifying the student's strengths and weaknesses, including a recommended number of instructional hours. Tutoring in academic subjects follows the design of the student's school program, so that he or she will show improvement in academic performance after the first few tutorial sessions. In test preparation tutorials, students have increased their scores by as much as 60 percentile points. A tutorial session normally consists of a minimum of two instructional hours of 50 minutes each.
