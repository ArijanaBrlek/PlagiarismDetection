Research Overview
The Ronald laboratory studies the role that genes play in a plants response to its environment. Our primary research focus is rice, the primary food for more than 3 billion people. We have four main research areas. Projects include the cloning and characterization of disease resistance genes, identification of pathogen produced signal molecules that interact with disease resistance gene products, biochemical analysis of disease resistance gene products and their interacting proteins, studies of the evolution of disease resistance loci, elucidation of the structure of the rice cell wall and analysis of sequences expressed during the rice defense response and cell wall formation.
