This is designed and best suited for Swallows,  however, since we at Birds Eye View have a nondiscriminatory policy, we have had Bluebirds, Wrens and Nuthatch renters.  It is designed to be mounted on a building, tree or pole.adobe birdhouse
Swallows are good neighbors with each other, most other birds and people. The good news is that swallows love mosquitoes and other insects.
This has an old Southwest Pueblo Indian Adobe flare, including roof poles, ladder, archway, cactus, dressing around the bird entrance and a raised nesting floor to prevent the potential of water seeping in under the birdhouse into the nesting area.indian adobe birdhouse
This comes plumbed with three drains and four natural air conditioners (vents), two on each side.  It is insulated with 7/8" cedar.  By removing three screws on the bottom you can take the bottom off for a complete spring cleaning.  The roof provides a platform for fatherbird to scout the area for any badguys while protecting motherbird and babies.southwest adobe birdhouse
