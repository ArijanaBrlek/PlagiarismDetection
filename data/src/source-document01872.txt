What is Ultrasonics? High frequency sound waves are used to produce more than 40,000 alternating high and low pressure waves per second.  As these waves travel through our specially formulated cleaning solution, millions of microscopic vacuum bubbles form and implode.  This process, know as cavitation, creates an action capable of cleaning up to 16 times more effectively than hand cleaning.  In minutes, all dirt, crud, light rust, loose lead, powder buildup and copper residue are removed from even the tiniest grooves and interior areas of the weapon being cleaned.
