The New Century Club
Vasily Kandinsky. Landscape with Two Poplars, 1912. Arthur Jerome Eddy Memorial Collection
The New Century Club of the Art Institute of Chicago honors those friends of the museum who have established a gift of $25,000 or more through a bequest, trust arrangement, or other estate-plan provision.
David W. Irwin, a founding trustee, made the first bequest to the Art Institute more than 100 years ago. He and other farsighted Chicagoans knew that the young institution and its collection would grow and prosper only if it were financially secureâ€”only if they and future members helped ensure its well-being by contributing funds as well as art. In the new century, others took up the challenge. The will of Joseph Winterbotham enabled the Art Institute to begin a collection of European art in 1921. The bequest of Kate Sturges Buckingham in 1937 provided for the care of Asian and European art that she and her siblings had given to the Art Institute. The bequest of Charles H. and Mary Worcester in 1947 not only included a collection of European paintings but also funds to enhance the collection. Each of these gifts helped to strengthen the Art Institute's endowment and ensure the permanence of its collection. Each continues to provide countless generations with the opportunity to view and appreciate the great art of this country and of the world. In recent years the estates of Margaret Chamales, Joanne Toor Cummings, and Alice Sharp have each in their own way added substantial growth to programs both at the school and the museum through the endowment.
As a member of the New Century Club, you can continue this important tradition and play a significant role in the future of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Endowment fund gifts help not only to expand and maintain the collections but also to provide support in many other areas. These include the following:
curatorial administration and research
museum education programs and lectures
publications about the museum's collection
conservation
acquisitions for the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries
care of museum galleries
visits by scholars and artists to the School of Art Institute
Donors may specify areas of particular interest they wish to assist or may simply contribute to the general endowment to help defray all expenses.
