What is AskNow ?
AskNow! is an online reference service. If you need information you can log in and ask our online librarians who can use the Web and other resources to help you with your inquiry. AskNow is designed to answer brief factual questions. For more complex enquiries we can provide advice on the best approach to locating the information you need. AskNow! is available across Australia from Monday to Friday from 9.00am to 5.00pm (except national public holidays). The project is run by the National, State and Territory libraries of Australia and is a project of CASL (The Council of Australian State Libraries). It is hosted by different libraries during the week.
