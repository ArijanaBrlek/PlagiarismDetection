DSL's Business Highlights
DSL is the prime Internet choice for small businesses because it offers speeds ranging from 144 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps, enabling access to a multitude of data pertinent to your business needs, from video and audio conferencing, to adding on new applications, to maintaining your own Web server. With DSL there is no waiting for a modem to dial up for an Internet connection. DSL allows you to connect to the Internet almost instantly. The expense of having a DSL connection is a mere fraction of traditional high speed solutions. For example, DSL can deliver the same bandwidth as typical leased services such as T1, at over half the savings. And, contrary to cable solutions, you're not competing for bandwidth amongst a network of other businesses. Recent surveys show that an overwhelming percentage of new DSL users say that DSL is a good value for its performance and speed, the benefits outweigh the cost, their productivity rates are up, and DSL makes the Internet a lot more enjoyable and user-friendly.
History of DSL
Designed primarily for video, DSL was first developed in 1989. Telephone companies expected to compete with cable television providers with Video on Demand (VOD) and interactive TV applications. However, with few exceptions, VOD has not lived up to its once-predicted popularity. The market for DSL instead shifted its focus from VOD to that of personal users who needed high-speed access to the Internet and corporate networks from private homes and remote businesses. The passage of the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, which permits phone companies, long-distance carriers, broadcasters of radio and television, ISPs and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment in the U.S. to compete within the same market, has made for tough competition among those providers to provide their customers with the fastest, most efficient broadband bandwidth service possible.
