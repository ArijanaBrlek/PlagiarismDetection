was launched on , . The satellite was 58 cm (about 23 in) in diameter and weighed approximately 83.6 kg (about 183 lb). Each of its elliptical orbits around the Earth took about 96 minutes. Monitoring of the satellite was done by many operators and the Jodrell Bank Observatory.

When reentry was attempted, a bug in the guidance system pointed the capsule in the wrong direction, so instead of re-entering the atmosphere the satellite moved into a higher orbit. It re-entered the atmosphere on or about September 5, 1962. An object identified as part of Sputnik 4 was found in a street in in the USA.

(Korabl Sputnik 5) was launched March 25, 1961. It carried a dummy cosmonaut and a dog (Zvezdochka), as well as the television system and other scientific apparatus. After one orbit, a successful recovery was made. This was the final precursor flight before Yuri Gagarin was launched on on April 12, 1961. Sputnik 10 Vostok 1
Later numbers were applied by Western observers first to cover the first eight and later to denote planetary missions, referring to failures or the 4th stage left in Earth orbit. (The Soviets during this period would not admit the existence of failures, so 'Sputnik' became the name used by trackers for such objects.) This practice seems to have ceased after , as the Soviets began to use the 'Cosmos' name to cover such failures. Cosmos satellites de facto Sputnik 25
