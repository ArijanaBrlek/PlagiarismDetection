When Not to Invest in Annuities
If you are not looking for an investment that will bring you great returns, help you plan your retirement and provide you tax benefits then annuities are not for you. Annuities are contracts offered by insurance companies wherein the investor pays a premium or premiums and is assured gains on it. For centuries annuities have been used to plan and protect one’s retired years. Even in the Roman Empire citizens could make a one-time payment and receive an annual pension for the rest of their lives. Annuities have come a long way since then and hold a number of features that investors can benefit from. Since there are so many different types of annuities such as the fixed annuity, the deferred annuity and the immediate annuity, this financial investment vehicle can be used to achieve various investment goals. The fact that tax is deferred on annuities makes it an even more attractive investment option. Since the gains from the annuity are not taxed on a yearly basis the investment compounds at a faster rate and brings in more profits for the investor. The investor pays tax on the gains only when he begins to receive income from the annuity or makes a withdrawal from it; and usually by that time the person is in a lower tax bracket.
So, when should you not invest in annuities?
If you are looking to make short-term investments then annuities is not a wise idea as most annuities offer long-term terms and conditions and the benefits are maximum when the investment is for a long period of time.
If you are unsure about being able to make the regular contributions to the annuity then it is wise to discuss with your annuity broker for an appropriate investment plan.
If you don’t want to plan for your retirement years and factors such as rising inflation and life expectancy do not bother you then annuities may not be the investment tool for you. This is primarily because annuities allow investors to create a retirement nest egg for themselves that they can count on once they stop working. An investor can make a lump sum payment or pay regular premiums and create a personal retirement plan.
If you don’t want to benefit from the tax deferral aspect of the annuities then perhaps annuities are not for you.
If you don’t want flexibility in your investment plan.
 
If you want to make a long-term investment and wish to protect your golden years and ensure that you can maintain a similar lifestyle as the one you are leading now, then annuities are an ideal option for you. Annuities allow people to invest in their future in a manner that is convenient to them and guarantee excellent gains..
