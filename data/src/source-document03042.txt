In terms of economic and social welfare, the European PVC industry supports 23,000 businesses and jobs for half a million people.
We believe, however, that our contribution must go further, so we are constantly striving to improve production processes and products, invest in technology, minimise emissions and waste and boost collection and recycling.
Vinyl 2010 pays particular attention to constructive social dialogue and has regular consultations with the European Mine, Chemical and Energy Workers' Federation to discuss workplace health, safety and training issues. Vinyl 2010 is also working with the new EU members to raise health, safety and environmental standards to higher levels throughout the enlarged EU.
