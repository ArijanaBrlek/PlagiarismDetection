Fun and Fitness for Children at My Gym Bellevue
July 9, 2008
My Gym Bellevue Welcomes You!
Bring your little one in to Play, Learn and Explore at My Gym Children's Fitness Center! My Gym offers programs to help children six weeks to 13 years of age develop physically, cognitively and emotionally.
Our Play, Learn and Explore meet-up was created to inform families the Eastside about FREE My Gym events coming up; and also to bring new moms together through classes, play times and other special events.
If you are looking for activities that are both stimulating for your infant or young child as well as an opportunity to meet other parents, My Gym offers the opportunity for both. Our exceptionally clean and safe facility, highly trained staff and award-winning programs make My Gym an ideal place to play, learn and explore with your young child!
