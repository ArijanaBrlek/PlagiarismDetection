(Lansing State Journal, August 10, 1994)
What experience do you have using car care products? How did you get started doing this?
I was an aircraft structural mechanic building airplanes at Rockwell in the 80’s and was affected by a shut down of their Columbus plant. Since I had a young family, I took a job detailing cars to make ends meet, and then was hired to sell Car Detailing products to the Professional Detailing Trade and Auto Dealers for a company that distributed car care products, which is no longer in business.
The Professional Detailing Trade and Auto Dealerships depend on Car Care and Appearance Products that work the first time, and are fast and easy to use.
I hired a Chemist to help me develop and manufacture our own wax – thus Jax Wax Liquid Paste Carnauba Wax was born.
It was a hit. Throughout the years, we have refined and developed other products with the same qualities - Working the First Time, and being Fast and Easy to use. The rest is history.

What makes Jax Wax Car Care Products better than other products available at stores?
All Jax Wax Car Care products have been designed and developed for use by Professional Detailers – whose livelihood depend on products that Work the First Time, and must be Fast and Easy to use.
Consequently they are designed to be of higher strength and potency, more versatile in their applications, and lower cost per application and per unit of measure.
For example, products like Shine All are designed to be mixed with water to create anywhere from a very high shine, to a satin, or a matte finish depending on your application and preferences.
If you try to change to appearance of most retail products, you might as well throw them in the trash.
This versatility coupled with low unit costs make our products superior to many other Car Care products offered in traditional Retail Markets.

Why does water bead up better on a well waxed car?
(Lansing State Journal, August 10, 1994)
Water is a polar molecule, composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom. Water molecules like to stick to one another, like small magnets. This is called cohesion. Water molecules also can be attracted to other substances, such as metal or dirt, especially if they have some static charge on them. This is called adhesion.
Lastly, some substances are not at all attracted to water, and even repel it. These include oils, fats and waxes; all of which are called non-polar substances.
When water falls on an unwaxed car, the forces of adhesion are almost as strong as the forces of cohesion, and the water spreads out. Furthermore, if the painted surface is not perfectly smooth, water can be channeled for some distance along tiny ridges and valleys. This is particularly true if there is dirt on the car. The dirt itself may be charged, and attract water even more. These tiny flaws may not be readily visible without a magnifying glass, but you can sense a rough surface when you run your hand over it. On such a rough surface, drops of water appear flat and wide and often uneven.
Car wax, when applied properly to a clean car, fills in the larger scratches and layers the whole car. The chemical structure of the wax prevents water from penetrating to the surface of the car. Because the wax itself is hydrophobic (literally "fears water"), the forces of adhesion are much less than the forces of cohesion. So, water is more likely to stick to itself, and water beads up higher and rounder than on an unwaxed car.
