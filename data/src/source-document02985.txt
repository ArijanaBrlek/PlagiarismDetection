Cho Pat Upper Arm Strap (swimmer's)
Our upper-arm strap is recommended for swimmers and other sports enthusiasts who may develop painful bicipital or tricipital tendonitis. Since the discomfort produced can influence athletic performance, the Cho-pat Upper-Arm Strap was specifically designed to prevent painful "swimmer's arm," but is now being used in other sports activities, as well.
This strap worn just above the bicep or tricep acts as a compression device to prevent the pulling and tearing of tendon fibers. To stay in top form, always wear the Cho-pat Upper-Arm Strap while engaged in water and other sports activities.
