INDIANA CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES
GUIDELINE 1. PREFACE
Guidelines to determine levels of child support were developed by the Judicial Administration Committee of the Judicial Conference of Indiana and adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court.The guidelines are consistent with the provisions of Indiana Code Title 31 which place a duty for child support upon parents based upon their financial resources and needs, the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not been dissolved or had the separation not been ordered, the physical or mental condition of the child, and the child's educational needs.
The Guidelines have three objectives:
(1) To establish as state policy an appropriate standard of support for children, subject to the ability of parents to financially contribute to that support;
(2) To make awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of people in similar circumstances;and
(3) To improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving courts and the parties guidelines in settling the level of awards.
The Indiana Child Support Guidelines are based on the Income Shares Model, developed by the Child Support Project of the National Center for State Courts.The Income Shares Model is predicated on the concept that the child should receive the same proportion of parental income that he or she would have received if the parents lived together.Because household spending on behalf of children is intertwined with spending on behalf of adults for most expenditure categories, it is difficult to determine the proportion allocated to children in individual cases, even with exhaustive financial information. However, a number of authoritative economic studies provide estimates of the average amount of household expenditure on children in intact households. These studies have found the proportion of household spending devoted to children is related to the level of household income and to the number and ages of children.The Indiana Child Support Guidelines relate the level of child support to income and the number of children.In order to provide simplicity in the use of the Guidelines, however, child support figures reflect a blend of all age categories weighted toward school age children.
ased on this economic evidence, the Indiana Child Support Guidelines calculate child support as the share of each parent's income estimated to have been spent on the child if the parents and child were living in an intact household.If one parent has custody, the amount calculated for that parent is presumed to be spent directly on the child.For the noncustodial parent, the calculated amount establishes the level of child support.

COMMENTARY
In June of 1985, the Judicial Reform Committee (now the Judicial Administration Committee) of the Judicial Conference of Indiana undertook the task of developing child support guidelines for use by Indiana judges. While the need had been long recognized in Indiana, the impetus for this project came from federal statutes requiring guidelines to be in place no later than October 1, 1987.P.L. 98‑378.Paradoxically, guidelines did not need to be mandatory under the 1984 federal legislation to satisfy federal requirements;they were only required to be made available to judges and other officials with authority to establish child support awards.45 CFR Ch. III, 302.56.History of Development.
The final draft was completed by the Judicial Reform Committee on July 24, 1987, and was presented to the Judicial Conference of Indiana Board of Directors on September 17, 1987.The Board accepted the report of the Reform Committee, approved the Guidelines and recommended their use to the judges of Indiana in all matters of child support.
Family Support Act of 1988.On October 13, 1988, the United States Congress passed the "Family Support Act of 1988," P.L. 100‑485 amending the Social Security Act by deleting the original language which made application of the guideline discretionary and inserted in its place the following language:
"There shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award which would result from the application of such guidelines is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.A written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, as determined under criteria established by the State, shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case."P.L. 100‑485, 103(a)(2).
The original Guidelines that went into effect October 1, 1987 and their commentary were revised by the Judicial Administration Committee to reflect the requirement that child support guidelines be a rebuttable presumption.The requirement applies to all cases where support is set after October 1, 1989, including actions brought under Title IV‑D of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. 651‑669).Also, after October 1, 1989, counties and individual courts may not opt to use alternate methods of establishing support.The Indiana Child Support Guidelines were required to be in use in all Indiana courts in all proceedings where child support is established or modified on and after October 1, 1989.
The "Family Support Act of 1988" also requires that the Guidelines be reviewed at least every four years "to assure their application results in the determination of appropriate child support award amounts."P.L. 100‑485, 103(b).Further, each state must develop a procedure to ensure that all Title IV‑D awards are periodically reviewed to ensure that they comply with the Guidelines.P.L. 100‑485, 103(c).Periodic Review of Guidelines and Title IV‑D Awards.
Compliance With State Law.The Child Support Guidelines were developed specifically to comply with federal requirements, as well as Indiana law.
Objectives of the Indiana Child Support Guidelines.The following three objectives are specifically articulated in the Indiana Child Support Guidelines:
1. When the Guidelines were first recommended for use by the Indiana Judicial Conference on September 17, 1987, many courts in the state had no guideline to establish support.Many judges had expressed the need for guidelines, but few had the resources to develop them for use in a single court system.The time, research and economic understanding necessary to develop meaningful guidelines were simply beyond the resources of most individual courts.To establish as state policy an appropriate standard of support for children, subject to the ability of parents to financially contribute to that support.
2. This consistency can be expected not only in the judgments of a particular court, but between jurisdictions as well.What is fair for a child in one court is fair to a similarly situated child in another court.To make awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of people in similar circumstances.
3. In other words, when the outcome is predictable, there is no need to fight. Because the human experience provides an infinite number of variables, no guideline can cover every conceivable situation, so litigation is not completely forestalled in matters of support. If the guidelines are consistently applied, however, those instances should be minimized.To improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving courts and the parties guidelines in settling the level of awards.
Economic Data Used in Developing Guidelines.What does it take to support a child? The question is simple, but the answer is extremely complex.Yet, the question must be answered if an adequate amount of child support is to be ordered by the court.Determining the cost attributable to children is complicated by intertwined general household expenditures.Rent, transportation, and grocery costs, to mention a few, are impossible to accurately apportion between family members.In developing these Guidelines, a great deal of reliance was placed on the research of Thomas J. Espenshade, (Investing In Children, Urban Institute Press, 1984) generally considered the most authoritative study of household expenditure patterns.Espenshade used data from 8,547 households and from that data estimated average expenditures for children present in the home.Espenshade's estimates demonstrate that amounts spent on the children of intact households rise as family income increases.They further demonstrate at constant levels of income that expenditures decrease for each child as family size increases.These principles are reflected in the Guideline Schedules for Weekly Support Payments, which are included in the Indiana Child Support Guidelines.By demonstrating how expenditures for each child decrease as family size increases, Espenshade should have put to rest the previous practice of ordering equal amounts of support per child when two or more children are involved.
Income Shares Model.After review of five approaches to the establishment of child support, the Income Shares Model was selected for the Indiana Guidelines.This model was perceived as the fairest approach for children because it is based on the premise that children should receive the same proportion of parental income after a dissolution that they would have received if the family had remained intact. Because it then apportions the cost of children between the parents based on their means, it is also perceived as being fair to parents.In applying the Guidelines, the following steps are taken:
1. The gross income of both parents is added together after certain adjustments are made.A percentage share of income for each parent is then determined.
2. The total is taken to the support tables, referred to in the Indiana Guidelines as the Guideline Schedules for Weekly Support Payments, to determine the total cost of supporting a child or children.
3. Work‑related child care expenses and the weekly costs of health insurance premiums for the child(ren) are then added to the basic child support obligation.
4. The child support obligation is then prorated between the parents, based on their proportionate share of the weekly adjusted income, hence the name "income shares."
The Income Shares Model was developed by The Institute for Court Management of the National Center for State Courts under the Child Support Guidelines Project. This approach was designed to be consistent with the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, the principles of which are consistent with IC 31‑16‑6‑1. Both require the court to consider the financial resources of both parents and the standard of living the child would have enjoyed in an intact family.
Gross Versus Net Income.One of the policy decisions made by the Judicial Administration Committee in the early stages of developing the Guidelines was to use a gross income approach as opposed to a net income approach.Under a net income approach, extensive discovery is often required to determine the validity of deductions claimed in arriving at net income.It is believed that the use of gross income reduces discovery.(See Commentary to Guideline 3A.) While the use of gross income has proven controversial, this approach is used by the majority of jurisdictions and, after a thorough review, is considered the best reasoned.
The basic support obligation would be the same whether gross income is reduced by adjustments built into the Guidelines or whether taxes are taken out and a net income option is used.A support guideline schedule consists of a column of income figures and a column of support amounts.In a gross income methodology, the tax factor is reflected in the support amount column, while in a net income guideline, the tax factor is applied to the income column.In devising the Indiana Guidelines, an average tax factor of 21.88 percent was used to adjust the support column.
Of course, taxes vary for different individuals.This is the case whether a gross or net income approach is used.Under the Indiana Guideline, where taxes vary significantly from the assumed rate of 21.88 percent, a trial court may choose to deviate from the guideline amount where the variance is substantiated by evidence at the support hearing.
Although application of the Guideline yields a figure that becomes a rebuttable presumption, there is room for flexibility.Guidelines are not immutable, black letter law.A strict and totally inflexible application of the Guidelines to all cases can easily lead to harsh and unreasonable results.If a judge believes that in a particular case application of the Guideline amount would be unreasonable, unjust, or inappropriate, a finding must be made that sets forth the reason for deviating from the Guideline amount.The finding need not be as formal as Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law;the finding need only articulate the judge's reasoning.For example, if under the facts and circumstances of the case, the noncustodial parent would bear an inordinate financial burden, the following finding would justify a deviation:Flexibility Versus the Rebuttable Presumption.
"Because the noncustodial parent suffers from a chronic medical condition requiring uninsured medical expenses of $357.00 per month, the Court believes that setting child support in the Guideline amount would be unjust and instead sets support in the amount of $___per week."
Agreed Orders submitted to the court must also comply with the "rebuttable presumption" requirement;that is, the order must recite why the order deviates from the Guideline amount.
1. Some courts may find it desirable in modification proceedings to gradually implement the Guideline order over a period of time, especially where support computed under the Guideline is considerably higher than the amount previously paid.Enough flexibility exists in the Guidelines to permit that approach, as long as the judge's rationale is explained with an entry such as:Phasing in Support Orders.
"The Guideline's support represents an increase of 40%, and the court finds that such an abrupt change in support obligation would render the obligor incapable of meeting his/her other established obligations. Therefore, the Court sets support in the amount of $_____ and, on October 1, 19___, it shall increase to $_____ and, on September 1, 19__, obligor shall begin paying the Guideline amount of $_____."
2. An infinite number of situations may prompt a judge to deviate from the Guideline amount.For illustration only, and not as a complete list, the following examples are offered:Situations Calling for Deviation.
span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>         One or both parties pay union dues as a condition of employment.
span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>         A party provides support for an elderly parent.
span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>         The noncustodial parent purchases school clothes.
span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>         The noncustodial parent has extraordinary medical expenses for himself or herself.

span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>         The custodial or noncustodial parent incurs significant travel expense in exercising visitation.
Again, no attempt has been made to define every possible situation that could conceivably arise when determining child support and to prescribe a specific method of handling each of them.Practitioners must keep this in mind when advising clients and when arguing to the court.Many creative suggestions will undoubtedly result.Judges must also avoid the pitfall of blind adherence to the computation for support without giving careful consideration to the variables that require changing the result in order to do justice.

GUIDELINE 2. USE OF THE GUIDELINES
For obligors with a combined weekly adjusted income, as defined by these Guidelines, of less than $100.00, the Guidelines provide for case‑by‑case determination of child support, normally with a range of $25.00‑$50.00 weekly.In such cases, the Court should carefully review the obligor's income and living expenses to determine the maximum amount of child support that can reasonably be ordered without denying the obligor the means for self‑support at a minimum subsistence level.A specific amount of child support should always be ordered.
The Guideline Schedules provide calculated amounts of child support to a combined weekly adjusted income level of 4,000 dollars ($4,000.00) or 208,000 dollars ($208,000.00) per year.For cases with higher combined weekly adjusted income, child support should be determined by using the formula found in Commentary to Guideline 3D3.
Temporary maintenance may be awarded by the court not to exceed thirty‑five percent (35%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income.In no case shall child support and temporary maintenance exceed fifty percent (50%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income.Temporary maintenance and/or child support may be ordered by the court either in dollar payments or "in‑kind" payments of obligations.
It is also intended that these guidelines be used in paternity cases and other child support actions.
Commentary
The Guideline's schedules for weekly support payments do not provide an amount of support for couples with combined weekly adjusted income of less than $100.00.Consequently the Guidelines do not establish a minimum support obligation.Instead the facts of each individual case must be examined and support set in such a manner that the obligor is not denied a means of self‑support at a subsistence level.It is, however, recommended that a specific amount of support be set.Even in situations where the noncustodial parent has no income, courts have routinely established a child support obligation at some minimum level.An obligor cannot be held in contempt for failure to pay support when there is no means to pay, but the obligation accrues and serves as a reimbursement if the obligor later acquires the ability to meet the obligation.Minimum Support.
The Guidelines Schedules for Weekly Support Payments provide calculations for the basic support obligation to a combined weekly adjusted income of $4,000.00 or annual adjusted income of $208,000.00.The formula for computing support, when combined annual adjusted income is above $208,000.00, is contained in Commentary to Guideline 3D3.Income in Excess of Guideline Schedule.
It is recommended that temporary maintenance not exceed thirty‑five percent (35%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income.The maximum award should be reserved for those instances where the custodial spouse has no income or no means of support, taking into consideration that spouse's present living arrangement (i.e., whether or not he or she lives with someone who shares or bears the majority of the living expense, lives in the marital residence with little or no expense, lives in military housing, etc.).Temporary Maintenance.
It is further recommended that the total of temporary maintenance and child support should not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income.In computing temporary maintenance, in‑kind payments, such as the payment of utilities, house payments, rent, etc., should also be included in calculating the percentage limitations.Care must also be taken to ensure that the obligor is not deprived of the ability to support himself or herself.
It should also be emphasized that the recommendations concerning maintenance apply only to temporary maintenance, not maintenance in the Final Decree.An award of spousal maintenance in the Final Decree must, of course, be made under IC 31‑15‑7‑2.These Guidelines do not alter those requirements.Theoretically, when setting temporary maintenance, child support should come first.That is, if child support is set at forty percent (40%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income, only a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the obligor's income would be available for maintenance.That distinction, however, makes little practical difference. s with temporary maintenance, care should be taken to leave the obligor with adequate income for subsistence.In many instances the court will have to review the impact of taxes on the obligor's income before entering an order for spousal maintenance in addition to child support to avoid injustice to the obligor.Spousal Maintenance.
The worksheet provides a deduction for spousal maintenance paid as a result of a former marriage (Line 1 C).Caution should be taken to assure that any credit taken is for maintenance and not for periodic payments as the result of a property settlement pursuant to IC 31‑15‑7‑4.No such deduction is given for amounts paid by an obligor as the result of a property settlement resulting from a former marriage, although that is a factor the court may wish to consider in determining the obligor's ability to pay the scheduled amount of support at the present time.Again, flexibility was intended throughout the Guidelines and they were not intended to place the obligor in a position where he or she loses all incentive to comply with the orders of the court.
Federal law now requires that the Indiana Child Support Guidelines be applied in every instance in which child support is established including, but not limited to, dissolutions of marriage, legal separations, paternity actions, juvenile proceedings, petitions to establish support and Title IV‑D proceedings.Guidelines to Be Applied in All Matters of Child Support.
The Indiana legislature requires the Indiana Child Support Guidelines be applied and the Child Support Worksheet be used in determining the manner in which financial services to children that are CHINS (Child in Need of Services) or delinquent are to be repaid (see I.C. 31-40-1-3). Similarly, the legislature requires the court to use the Guidelines to determine the financial contribution required from each parent of a child or the guardian of the child estate for costs associated with the institutional placement of a child (see I.C. 31-40-1-5).

GUIDELINE 3. DETERMINATION OF CHILD SUPPORT AMOUNT
A. Definition of Weekly Gross Income.
1. For purposes of these Guidelines, "weekly gross income" is defined as actual weekly gross income of the parent if employed to full capacity, potential income if unemployed or underemployed, and imputed income based upon "in‑kind" benefits.Weekly gross income of each parent includes income from any source, except as excluded below, and includes, but is not limited to, income from salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, overtime, partnership distributions, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains, social security benefits, workmen's compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, gifts, inheritance, prizes, and alimony or maintenance received from other marriages.Specifically excluded are benefits from means‑tested public assistance programs, including, but not limited to Temporary Aid To Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income, and Food Stamps.Definition of Weekly Gross Income (Line 1 of Worksheet).
2. Weekly Gross Income from self‑employment, operation of a business, rent, and royalties is defined as gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses.In general, these types of income and expenses from self‑employment or operation of a business should be carefully reviewed to restrict the deductions to reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenditures necessary to produce income.These expenditures may include a reasonable yearly deduction for necessary capital expenditures.Weekly gross income from self‑employment may differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes.Self‑Employment, Business Expenses, In‑Kind Payments and Related Issues.
Expense reimbursements or in‑kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self‑employment, or operation of a business should be counted as income if they are significant and reduce personal living expenses.Such payments might include a company car, free housing, or reimbursed meals.
The self‑employed shall be permitted to deduct that portion of their F.I.C.A. tax payment that exceeds the F.I.C.A. tax that would be paid by an employee earning the same Weekly Gross Income.
3. If a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support shall be calculated based on a determination of potential income.A determination of potential income shall be made by determining employment potential and probable earnings level based on the obligor's work history, occupational qualifications, prevailing job opportunities, and earnings levels in the community.If there is no work history and no higher education or vocational training, it is suggested that weekly gross income be set at least at the federal minimum wage level.Unemployed, Underemployed and Potential Income.
4. In determining a support order, there should be an adjustment to Weekly Gross Income of parents who have natural or legally adopted children living in their households, and who were born or adopted subsequent to the prior support order.Natural and Adopted Children Living in the Household.
Commentary
1. Weekly gross income, potential income, weekly adjusted income and basic child support obligation have very specific and well‑defined meanings within the Indiana Child Support Guidelines.Their definitions are not repeated in the Commentary, but further explanation follows.Weekly Gross Income.
Child Support Calculations Generally.
2. Determination of Weekly Gross Income.Weekly gross income is the starting point in determining the child support obligation, and it must be calculated for both parents.If one or both parents have no income, then potential income may be calculated and used as weekly gross income.Likewise, imputed income may be substituted for, or added to, other income in arriving at weekly gross income. It includes such items as free housing, a company car that may be used for personal travel, and reimbursed meals or other items received by the obligor that reduce his or her living expenses.
The Child Support Obligation Worksheet does not include space to calculate weekly gross income.It must be calculated separately and the result entered on the worksheet.
In calculating weekly gross income, it is helpful to begin with total income from all sources.This figure may not be the same as gross income for tax purposes.Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 61.Means‑tested public assistance programs (those based on income) are excluded from the computation of weekly gross income, but other government payments, such as social security benefits and veterans pensions, should be included.Only the income of the parties is included in Weekly Gross Income.The income of the spouses of the parties is not included in Weekly Gross Income.
a. Self‑Employment, Rent and Royalty Income.Calculating weekly gross income for the self‑employed or for those who receive rent and royalty income presents unique problems, and calls for careful review of expenses.The principle involved is that actual expenses are deducted, and benefits that reduce living expenses (company cars, free lodging, reimbursed meals, etc.) should be included in whole or in part.It is intended that actual out‑of‑pocket expenditures for the self‑employed, to the extent that they are reasonable and necessary for the production of income, be deducted.Reasonable deductions for capital expenditures may be included.While income tax returns may be helpful in arriving at weekly gross income for a self‑employed person, the deductions allowed by the Guidelines may differ significantly from those allowed for tax purposes.
The self‑employed pay F.I.C.A. tax at twice the rate that is paid by employees.At present rates, the self‑employed pay fifteen and thirty one‑hundredths percent (15.30%) of their gross income to a designated maximum, while employees pay seven and sixty‑five (7.65%) to the same maximum.The self‑employed are therefore permitted to deduct one‑half of their F.I.C.A. payment when calculating Weekly Gross Income.
b. Overtime, Commissions, Bonuses and Other Forms of Irregular Income.There are numerous forms of income that are irregular or nonguaranteed, which cause difficulty in accurately determining the gross income of a party.Overtime, commissions, bonuses, periodic partnership distributions, voluntary extra work and extra hours worked by a professional are all illustrations, but far from an all‑inclusive list, of such items.Each is includable in the total income approach taken by the Guidelines, but each is also very fact‑sensitive.
Each of the above items is sensitive to downturns in the economy.The fact that overtime, for example, has been consistent for three (3) years does not guarantee that it will continue in a poor economy.Further, it is not the intent of the Guidelines to require a party who has worked sixty (60) hour weeks to continue doing so indefinitely just to meet a support obligation that is based on that higher level of earnings.Care should be taken to set support based on dependable income, while at the same time providing children with the support to which they are entitled.
When the court determines that it is not appropriate to include irregular income in the determination of the child support obligation, the court should express its reasons.When the court determines that it is appropriate to include irregular income, an equitable method of treating such income may be to require the obligor to pay a fixed percentage of overtime, bonuses, etc., in child support on a periodic but predetermined basis (weekly, bi‑weekly, monthly, quarterly) rather than by the process of determining the average of the irregular income by past history and including it in the obligor's gross income calculation.
One method of treating irregular income is to determine the ratio of the basic child support obligation (line 4 of the worksheet) to the combined weekly adjusted income (line 3 of the worksheet) and apply this ratio to the irregular income during a fixed period.For example, if the basic obligation was $110.00 and the combined income was $650.00, the ratio would be .169 ($110.00 / $650.00).The order of the court would then require the obligor to make a lump sum payment of.169 of the obligor's irregular income received during the fixed period.
The use of this ratio will not result in an exact calculation of support paid on a weekly basis.It will result in an overstatement of the additional support due, and particularly so when average irregular income exceeds $250.00 per week or exceeds 75% of the regular adjusted weekly gross income.In these latter cases the obligor may seek to have the irregular income calculation redetermined by the court.
Another form of irregular income may exist when an obligor takes a part‑time job for the purpose of meeting financial obligations arising from a subsequent marriage, or other circumstances.Modification of the support order to include this income or any portion of it may require that the obligor continue with that employment just to meet an increased support obligation, resulting in a disincentive to work.
Judges and practitioners should be innovative in finding ways to include income that would have benefited the family had it remained intact, but be receptive to deviations where reasons justify them.The foregoing discussion should not be interpreted to exclude consideration of irregular income of the custodial parent.
c. Potential Income.Potential income may be determined if a parent has no income, or only means‑tested income, and is capable of earning income or capable of earning more.Obviously, a great deal of discretion will have to be used in this determination.One purpose of potential income is to discourage a parent from taking a lower paying job to avoid the payment of significant support.Another purpose is to fairly allocate the support obligation when one parent remarries and, because of the income of the new spouse, chooses not to be employed.The four examples which follow illustrate some of the considerations affecting attributing potential income to an unemployed or underemployed parent.
1) When a custodial parent with young children at home has no significant skills or education and is unemployed, he or she may not be capable of entering the work force and earning enough to even cover the cost of child care.Hence, it may be inappropriate to
