Lighting Installation Creates Personalized Response
, a developer and manufacturer of LED lighting solutions, has partnered with Jason Bruges Studio, in creating an animated lighting feature at a Glasgow, Scotland mall. The Silverburn Shopping Centre features a vertical linear lighting sculpture, which hangs from the ceiling of the main atrium and walkway and displays a variety of animated effects in response to the activity of people passing under it.
Lighting Science Group (LSG)
The design from , located in London, was implemented by integrating Lighting Science Group’s high-intensity X16 Dotz LEDs with White Wing Logics camera recognition software and a DMX control system. Hundreds of X16 Dotz hang from the mall ceiling in a vertical configuration, each one individually controlled by the DMX system. As the camera registers the motion of each passing shopper, the data is translated by the DMX system to generate animated effects that create wavelike patterns of light. The result is a personalized experience for each person interacting with the display. Jason Bruges Studio
The flexibility of the LSG solution and the short lead time allowed us to achieve our design concepts and gave us the ability to provide our client with a cost-effective solution and very unique feature for the shopping centre, says Zena Bruges, managing director of Jason Bruges Studio.
As an innovator in LED technology, LSG welcomes the complex technical challenges that the Jason Bruges Studios dynamic designs present, says Govi Rao, chief executive officer of Lighting Science Group. By continually stretching their creativity to design lighting installations that interact in exciting ways with people and the environment, they push us to find new ways to bring light, color and movement to the Studios visions with our pace-setting LED solutions.

LEDs Used For New Year’s Eve Icon
At the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2008, those people in Times Square in New York City will ring in the New Year under the glow of a Times Square ball illuminated by LED technology.
For the first time in history, New Years eves most iconic image, the Times Square Ball, will be lit by LEDs, said Govi Rao, chairman and chief executive officer of , the company responsible for the lighting system being used. Lighting Science Group
Lighting Science Group (LSG) was commissioned by to develop an LED lighting system to deliver the first environmentally friendly, brighter, more responsive New Years Eve ball, while maintaining the core lighting elements of the old ball. The new ball is 6 feet in diameter and weighs 1,200 pounds, and consists of 9,576 Philips LEDs and 672 of Waterfords double-cut crystals. Philips Lighting
The new ball incorporates both colored and white LEDs. The colored LEDs were designed to consume only one to two watts of energy while delivering the same light output as the 40-Watt colored incandescent bulbs used last year.(Photo above is of the ball used last year.)
Rao stated, LEDs are the most responsive, and among the most energy efficient lighting technologies ever created. Finding a way to integrate the flexibility of all the balls elements with the vision of the lighting designers was a unique challenge for LSG. Our engineers were able to create an integrated package that highlights all the best features of each element, the Philips LEDs, and the Waterford Crystals, to generate breath-taking displays, and lighting effects.
Countdown Entertainment, owners of the Time Square New Years Eve event, commissioned Philips Lighting and Waterford Crystal to create the new ball. Lighting Science was hired by Philips to integrate both companies technologiesspecifically designing, integrating and assembling light engines to manage the balls power and communications signalsto guarantee that the structure works correctly on New Years’ Eve.
Lighting Science worked with Focus Lighting, the balls lighting designer, and Hudson Scenic, the balls structural framework designer and manufacturer, to ensure that the overall integration went seamlessly.
The technology platform developed by Lighting Science boasts more than 16 million vivid, vibrant, highly-saturated colors as well as billions of possible effects, added Rao. This New Years Eve ball highlights our unique capabilities in delivering high performance LED based solutions and we are proud to help the world usher in the New Year  in a more responsible way.
