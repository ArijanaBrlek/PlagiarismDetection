Will your DJ show up at your wedding in blue jeans?  It is very important that your DJ show up wearing the proper attire for the occasion.  After all he / she will be the one up front during most of the event.
                                                                       
3.    What type of equipment is he going to show up with?
Many DJs use equipment that can be purchased at your local Retail Stores.This equipment is designed mostly for home use.   This equipment will not produce the quality or sound you would be paying for.

Being a good DJ is one thing, but being able to do karaoke is another.  Just having karaoke equipment is not enough.
    It takes a special talent to do a Karaoke party.Your DJ needs to be a person that is able to make people feel at ease enough to get up in front and participate.   This is not always easy at first, but once it gets going it will be one of the highlights of the party.
