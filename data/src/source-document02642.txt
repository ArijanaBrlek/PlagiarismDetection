Dance
The dance department at Connecticut College has established a philosophical framework supported by its curriculum and activities in response to the present state of the education of the arts including multiculturalism and internationalization. The approach to education is based on "ways of knowing, thinking, doing and creating."
The centerpiece of the department is the recognition of the importance of an individual's interaction with the world as a whole person, not just as an artist. The late artist and educator Joseph Beuys once said: "A total work of art is only possible in the context of the whole of society."
Although some of our students may not earn a full living as practicing artists, our style of education, which focuses on developing the person, allows for the possibility of providing a future in which everyone is capable of being a participant of the social landscape.
The foundation of the education in dance at Connecticut College is designed to prepare our students to enter various fields of dance and to prepare them for graduate programs with both kinesthetic and intellectual knowledge with the aim that some of the graduates of this department will become members of professional dance companies or choreographers in their own rights.
