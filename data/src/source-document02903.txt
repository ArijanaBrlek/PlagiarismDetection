Lighthouses on Lake Superior
I took a trip around Lake Superior August 31-September 5, 1998, beginning at Munising, Michigan and following M-28 east to I-75, north to Canada, 17 from Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay, and then south on 61, and trips to Upper Michigan during 1998 and 99. Here are some lighthouses I saw on those trips.
