New home of Class 48 George S. Mickelson Criminal Justice Training Center - Pierre
 
Recruit class 48 would like to welcome you to the South Dakota Highway Patrol Academy Recruit Page.  We appreciate your interest in our progress and development into state troopers.  We are honored to serve the citizens of South Dakota and the state’s many visitors.
 
As you will find, Class 48 is a class of many firsts.  We are the first recruit class to be trained in the George S. Mickelson Building from start to finish.  Class 48 is honored to be 1 Sergeant Noel Gabriel’s first recruit training class.  Class 48 will also be the first South Dakota Highway Patrol class to be combined with other law enforcement agencies for the Law Enforcement Training Standards Class.  After the 12 weeks of the Law Enforcement Training Standards Course, we will continue to finish our training as State Trooper Class 48.st
 
First Sgt. Gabriel has been serving with the South Dakota Highway Patrol for nearly 24 years.  Sergeant Gabriel started out his career as a State Trooper in Howard.  He has also been part of the Motor Carrier Division for 11 years.  Sgt. Gabriel was first promoted on October 31, 1996 to Administration Sergeant.  He recently made a lateral transfer to Training Sergeant of the South Dakota Training Academy.
The Recruit Academy welcomed 14 new recruits to Class 48 on Sunday evening December 2, 2007.  Our first day of the 21-week academy was December 3, 2007.  Lieutenant Scott Sheldon, First Sergeant Noel Gabriel, and Sergeant Brad Millard checked in the recruits. 
This page will be updated often to provide pictures and information about recruit activities.  Check back to see how the newest additions to the Highway Patrol are doing.
