Not all math questions on the SAT are multiple-choice. For one type â€” called a student-produced response (or grid-in) -- you have to find and fill in your own answer.
No Penalty for Wrong Answers
No points will be subtracted for a wrong answer to this question-type, since there are no multiple-choice options.
Compared to Other Question-Types
Grid-ins are like regular math questions. They cover the same subject areas, and they range in difficulty from easy to hard.
