Atari Lynx
Atari's first portable game system, the Atari Lynx was designed by Epyx and the engineers who created the Amiga. Ahead of its time, the Lynx sported a backlit color screen and impressive games, but was unable to tackle the Gameboy juggernaut.
Atari Jaguar
Atari's last game console, the Atari Jaguar represented a huge leap in technology from previous offerings. Featuring a 64-bit architecture, the Jaguar had great potential, but its power was difficult to tap. Even then, many great games were released and the Jaguar has an avid fan base today.
