Parallel Balcony
Special systems Hermet 10
Maximum watertightness and total security, are the advantages of the parallel window Hermet 10.
With its exclusive ironwork system, the parallel window presents/displays a very smooth and comfortable route, moving slightly the plane of the window towards the outside. At the moment of the closing, the movable plane moves again towards the interior, being On guard closed perfectly aligned with the fixed leaf, unlike the systems of conventional sliding windows.
This system allows the window to perfectly close with the maximum watertightness, being in addition assured by several points of closing that are distributed around all the perimeter of the frame.
The parallel window of Hermet 10 is constructed with the habitual Kömmerling profiles, offering the maximum insulating benefits, easy conservation and great durability, and in addition it offers a great variety of different finishings.
