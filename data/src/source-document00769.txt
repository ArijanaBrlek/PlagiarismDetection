Starbucks Card
A Brief History of Starbucks
Starbucks has always been a place where you can find the world’s best coffees. But in 1971, you would have had to travel all the way to our only store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market.
The first Starbucks opens. The name comes from Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century whaling industry. The seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world’s finest coffees to the cold, thirsty people of Seattle.1970s
Howard Schultz joins Starbucks in 1982. While on a business trip in Italy, he visits Milan’s famous espresso bars. Impressed with their popularity and culture, he sees their potential in Seattle. He’s right – after trying lattes and mochas, Seattle quickly becomes coffee-crazy.1980s
Starbucks expands beyond Seattle, first to the rest of the United States, then the entire world. After becoming one of the first companies to offer stock options to its part-time employees, Starbucks becomes a publicly traded company.1990s
The Starbucks phenomenon continues.  Our first store in Australia opens in July 2000 at Hyde Park in Sydney, NSW.  2000s
As of this writing, Starbucks has more than 13,000 locations in over 41 countries. In addition to our excellent coffees and espresso drinks, people now also enjoy Tazo® tea and Frappuccino® blended beverages.
