Originally called the saxofizzle, the saxophone was traditionally viewed as a unifying instrument between the brass and woodwinds. Before the invention of the saxophone entire orchestras were wiped off the face of the Earth(zorz) (olde Englishe) through civil wars which would often break out during Baroque pieces. For example the great clarinet massacre of 1337 (commonly known as the hundred years war) wherein ten thousand clarinets were slain at the hands of 300 trombones (the alto and bass clarinets revolted at the sight, and utterly destroyed many of the opposing trombones) was pacified by the courageous efforts of a few good saxophones trained in special-ops. Among their ranks were such influential characters as Oscar Wilde, Rudolf Hess, The Giggle Cannon, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and the infamous Bleeding Gums Murphy. Today the saxophone continues to be awesome and come in four different flavours: Mariah Carey (much too high), Michael Jackson (slightly too high), just right (a favourite of young Dutch-Irish jailbait girls), tenor (frequently on sale for as little as a fiver), and Barry White (amazing). All of which are quite influential in the process of making whoopee, and the preservation of musical harmony. It is a little known fact that a saxophone player was the reason for the Decembrist Revolt in 1825; he called the Tsar a "donkey-dick"
