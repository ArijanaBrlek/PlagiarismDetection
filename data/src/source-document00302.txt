Trans Fat Vs Non-Trans In The Vegetarian Environment
Everyone knows that too much fat in your body is unhealthy. Aside from becoming obese, it poses serious health risks that are indeed life-threatening. This is one of the few harmful elements that most vegetarians are trying to clear away from by opting for a meatless diet, which are sources of cholesterol and saturated fats.
On the other hand, some nutritionists also recommend having a considerable amount of fat included in your diet. So, how do you create that balance?
Fat Requirements for the Body
Contrary to popular belief, fat plays an important role in your body. Therefore, it is important that you also include sufficient amount of fat in your diet. But make sure not to have too much as to trigger deadly diseases. The key here is knowing how to create a balance so you get all the essential nutrients.
- It suffices your body with up to 9 calories per gram of fat. - It helps carry vitamins such as A, D, E, and K, which are all fat-soluble. - Some parts of your body such as hair, nails, and skin need essential oils in order to maintain its growth and vitality. Fat provides these essential oils.
Again, it is important to become aware of the type of fat consumed as it has dramatic impact in your overall health condition.
What is Trans-Fat?
Trans fat is a common term for trans fatty acids, which is among the broad types of fats that are present in most foods. This type of fat, however, is an unsaturated fatty acid so it is unlike ‘cis fat’.
You will find trans fat mostly in milk or body fat of certain animals such as sheep or cows. Before, trans fats were mostly consumed from animal products. However, it was recently revealed by a study that plant-based foods are also major contributors of trans fat.
Therefore, beware of manufactured products such as vegetable shortenings or margarine because they consist of artificial trans fat which are partially hydrogenated and may have 45% more trans fat than their total.
Health Impact of Trans Fat
The production of trans fat is achieved by turning liquid oils into solid substances, such as mentioned above are margarine and shortenings. They are commonly produce to help extend the shelf life of most food products and used to enhance the flavor of foods.
Take note of the following food types that contain trans fat:
- some crackers - cookies - snack foods - vegetable shortenings
Since this contributes to raising your level of cholesterol, it can be considered as “bad” type of fat which can lead to more risks of heart disease.
Different Types of Fat
Fat provides the source for converting energy needed by your body to perform daily activities. Meanwhile, it also aids in helping absorb essential vitamins like A, E, K, and carotenoids. However, it is important to consume fat in moderate amounts only. That way, you can ensure that your body gets fat that it will need to grow and develop, while also maintaining a healthy well being. This type of nutrient is most important for toddlers and infants as it assists in their growth process.
Unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are the healthier type of fats. Still, they need to be consumed at moderate levels to ensure good health.
Practical Ways to Consume Fat
Since fat is an essential part of your diet, you need to consume it with caution in order to make sure that you are getting only the required amount for your body. Here are a few practical ways to ensure healthy consumption of fat:
Choose healthy alternatives to fat  instead of saturated or trans fat, you must opt for polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats; these type of fats are healthier when taken in moderation and do not contribute to increasing your cholesterol levels  good sources of these alternative fats are corn oil, soybean oil, fish, nuts, etc.

Take note of your calorie intake  normal amounts of fat will have 9 calories per gram of fat.
