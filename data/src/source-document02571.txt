The Trackertm
Covert Electronic Tracking System, Complete System (Order #6500) Beeper Bumper System
The is a revolutionary new Radio Direction Finder (RDF) and electronic tracking system designed specifically for law enforcement covert tracking. Consisting of a 4-antenna DF array for magnetic mounting on a vehicle and an enhanced Doppler DF processor with proprietary DSP algorithms, the is ready to monitor almost any type of electronic tracking beacon and provide you with a bearing and relative range to the signal.TrackerTracker
 
 
 
Specifically designed for law enforcement and military applications, the overcomes the serious problem of multipath interference common to virtually every other radio direction finder. Two powerful microprocessors apply newly developed algorithms to analyze and discard confusing indications due to phase shift from multipath signals. The result is a clear, unambiguous bearing to the target. The is very easy to use even for non-technical personnel.TrackerTracker
Multi site RDF networks are simple to implement. The includes an RS232 port, and the unit can overlay NMEA GPS data from virtually any GPS receiver onto the DF bearing and output the data to a laptop running a mapping program. Additionally, our software can be used to implement small or large area coverage multi-site applications where DF bearings from all-equipped stations are linked via a packet data channel and displayed simultaneously in realtime on all computers in the net. This application is common in man-critical work such as kidnaping/ransom tracking, executive protection, drug interdiction, etc. A simple beacon is all that is needed in the package to be tracked.TrackerTRACKnetTracker
 
 
  Vehicle Tracking Transmitter "Bumper Beeper" P/N TRV-2W - Vehicle Beacon with Motion Sensor
Use the to follow and locate body wires, vehicle tracking beacons, tagged CDS shipments or cash packages, stuck transmitters, pirate/stolen transmitters, deliberate or inadvertent interference, covert beacons, HAZMAT shipments, etc. Anywhere you need to follow an RF signal is a job for theTrackerTracker.
