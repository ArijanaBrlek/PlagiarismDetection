Bachelorette Party Basics
by Mary Liu, VowsForever.com
The Bachelorette Party has become a new tradition these days - a time for you to share with your best girlfriends. Even though you will be joining the world of "married couples," you're letting your friends know that you can still have fun with them and be a part of their lives.
If you are uncomfortable with a night of cocktails, male revue clubs, etc., then tailor it to something you know you'll enjoy. For example, what about an old-fashioned slumber party? Or, a Salon pamper yourself party? Looking for something even tamer? There's always dinner or just coffee and dessert. Just remember to have fun and spend some quality time with your girlfriends.
