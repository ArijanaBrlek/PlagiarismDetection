I will gladly pay a little more to not sign a long term contract.(commitment issues?) Many people have moved only to find the long term contract phone they are locked into has terrible or no reception in their new location. You are required to pay the contract even if you can't use it. Credit checks--If you have bad credit or an unpaid old bill you might not be able to get a contract phone. Losing or breaking a contract phone--often the replacement phone will cost you a bundle and you have to pay your monthly contract even if you can't afford a replacement phone.
