Welcome to Carousel Park!-Created by World's Fair enthusiast/collector Mitch Silverstein. One interesting aspect of World's Fair history is the legacies these fairs leave behind.
The centerpiece of this remarkable website features the stories of the two carousels which appeared at the World's Fair at Carousel Park and the Belgian Village. One of them still operates at Flushing Meadows-Corona park today, and arrived at the 1964 Fair already being a legacy of Coney Island's golden age from the turn of the 20th century. Also featured on the site are World's Fair construction site maps, games, and an amazing peek into the site host's extensive collection of World's Fair memorabilia.
