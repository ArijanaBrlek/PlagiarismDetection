Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
Keeping children safe from lead poisoning requires attention from everyone in a child's life. Lead is harmful to children because if they get enough of it in their bodies, it can limit their physical development. Lead is found in a variety of locations and products, such as old house paint, contaminated soil, ceramic bowls and plates, and hobby supplies. The biggest source of lead exposure for children is from old chipping house paint.
The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention program (CLPP) is funded through the State Department of Health Services. The CLPP employs a team of health professionals, who provide services to parents, healthcare providers, and the general public. This team is comprised of:
Registered Environmental Specialists, who conduct investigations to determine the source of lead contamination in the home.
Public Health Nurses, who work with families to identify possible sources of contamination and to educate families on ways to reduce the risk of lead contamination.
Health Educators, who conduct health fairs, workshops and special trainings for health care providers and the general public.
The CLPP program provides services in two major ways:
In cases where the child's blood lead level is 10 micrograms per deciliter or greater, a Public Health Nurse contacts the family either by phone or letter to provide education to prevent further lead poisoning.Case Management and Source Identification for Lead Poisoned Children
In cases where the blood lead level is 20 micrograms per deciliter or greater, a Public Health Nurse and a Registered Environmental Health Specialist visit the home of the child to provide education to prevent further poisoning and to attempt to identify the source of the lead poisoning.
The CLPP program focuses on provider education and screening requirements. The program can provide a variety of educational and informational information to health care providers, contractors, and the general public.Outreach and Education to the Community and Targeted Groups
