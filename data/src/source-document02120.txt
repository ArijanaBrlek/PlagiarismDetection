Before you order your new chassis, be prepared to consider what you are comfortable working on yourself and what you should have pre-assembled. Every vintage Rover should have new brake and fuel lines, which are much easier to run before installing the body. Another often overlooked part of the swap is the steering relay. A new one, pre-fitted, will save you the time (and danger) of trying to remove your old one which probably isn't safe to use again anyway. If you are doing a complete restoration, you may want to consider having a remanufactured engine, transmission or transfer case pre-fitted as well. These are the same chassis we use in our award winning restoration shop when we bring Rovers back to life as daily drivers or show winners. With the proper planning and pre-assembly done before delivery, it is conceivable to have your Series or Defender riding on a new chassis in as little as two weekends. Each rolling chassis is custom built-to-order to your specifications, call to reserve yours.
  Chassis are shipped via motor freight and require a loading dock at their destination. They are custom-crated here at our warehouse to protect them on their journey. The chassis are shipped from our warehouse in Springfield, Vermont, and depending the destination, the charges typically run between $800 - $1000 for a bare chassis. Rolling chassis have different shipping requirements depending on the level of assembly, call for details.     D.A.P. Parts and Accessories
