Adobe Restoration Workshop
Sun-dried brick is one of the oldest and most common building materials know to man. Traditional adobe construction techniques have not varied in the western United States since the 16the century. Unbaked bricks, a combination of clay, sand, and water, were formed in wooden molds and set to dry in the sun until formed into shelters for the areaâ€™s earliest settlers. This workshop provides a sampling of that traditional construction and insight into the aging process by visiting and restoring historic sites.
