 It All Begins with Espresso Roast
The best machine, the best milk, even the best barista aren't enough to create the ultimate cappuccino or flat white.  Without the very best espresso coffee, espresso beverages are forgettable.  Not at Starbucks.  We created Espresso Roast over 35 years ago to be the ultimate espresso coffee - sweet, caramelly, intense - perfect on its own, but equally divine mingling with velvety steamed milk and your favourite flavourings.  Visit one of our stores to experience Starbucks espresso, handcrafted just for you, however you like it.
Take Espresso Roast Home and Be Your Own Barista
Our stores sell 250 gram whole bean bags of , the coffee we fresh grind and brew for the intense, caramelly-sweet espresso shots in your favorite coffee beverage.  Ask your barista to grind it for your specific brewing method, free of charge. Espresso Roast
