SnapStream Beyond TV is personal video recording (PVR) software that adds television recording capabilities to ordinary home PCs. In addition to basic PVR features like time-shifting live television and recorded shows, there are numerous other features that are unique to the Beyond TV software. With features such as SmartSkip™, ShowSqueeze™, multiple-tuners and Beyond TV Link support, Beyond TV is unsurpassed in the industry.
Software developers can take advantage of what our software has to offer through Beyond TV’s rich Software Developer Kit. The SDK allows automation and extension of Beyond TV on local PCs or across the home network.

Getting started
Get a brief description on how to get up and running with the SDK using Visual Studio .NET 2003. This may be old hat to some experienced developers, but for those of you who are new to web services or Visual Studio .NET in general, it should help to get you up and running in no time.
There are plenty of good reasons to read and write your own media properties. This tutorial shows you just how easy it is to read out all the media properties in a recording and how to add your own.
