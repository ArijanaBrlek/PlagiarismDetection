- Guess you don't like bugs, or maybe you collect them. Well, as a insect collector, I wanted a better way to catch flying and crawling insects for my collection, as well as a way to catch and dispose of annoying ones around my home. That's why we have taken the best qualities from the fly swatter, fly paper, and the Venus Fly Trap to combine them and create the most amazing bug collector/terminator ever! Just one easy flick of the trigger, the bug sticks to it, then you remove it for your collection or into the garbage it goes and it's out of sight for good. Catch flying insects in mid-air! Trap and catch crawling insects on the ground, walls, etc. Now you can finally get those little gnats and fruit flies that like to invade your kitchen. Easily defend your picnic or barbeque from bees and wasps without using toxic chemicals. Sweep crawling insects off of virtually any surface! You'll never have to smash a bug on your wall ever again. No more germs and no more unsightly residue. Catch them in perfect condition for your collections. Touch-free easy disposal! Keep your home clean and sanitary. Grow your collection the easy,clean,way. www.stickyswat.com The simple and easy way to collect insects, great for students and even beginners
