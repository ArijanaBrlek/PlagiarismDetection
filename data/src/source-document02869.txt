IP Satellite provides quick, cost-effective distribution of video and data, especially to multiple remote sites simultaneously, in a way that combines satellite and Internet technologies. It is most effectively used between remote sites continually and permanently connected to the host, such as branch offices, retail stores or a company's manufacturing facilities.
IP differs from traditional KU-band satellite in that a much smaller slice of a transponder is required to multicast video in the form of data files. These data files can then be stored and forwarded to the end user, thus enabling video on demand. Because the video is sent in an IP format, it more easily integrates into terrestrial networks such as LANs/WANs and can also be used to distribute large data files. A typical downlink site will require a sub-meter dish and a combination receiver/server/router.
Sending video/data via IP Satellite also overcomes the challenges associated with terrestrial broadband solutions. First, with a private IP network, you can bypass the congestion of the public Internet. Second, you aren't limited by the spotty coverage of DSL/cable modems or the astronomical expense of T1 lines. IP Satellite allows you to reach every one of your sites securely, reliably and economically.
