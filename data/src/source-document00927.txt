1 Tornado formation
Tornadoes develop from severe thunderstorms, usually spawned from s and s, though they sometimes happen as a result of a . They are believed to be produced when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, forcing the warm air to rise rapidly, though tornadoes over water ( s) frequently are observed forming in the absence of convection or apparent strong surface temperature differences. Tornadoes are inextricably associated with , and tornadoes (as well as s) exhibit enormous electromagnetic fields that are inexplicable by convection models. Many tornadoes appear at the tail end of s, coming from areas on screens that show a characteristic "hook echo". squall line supercell thunderstorm hurricane waterspout lightning For alternate meanings, see Lightning (disambiguation). Lightning is a powerful natural electrostatic discharge produced during a thunderstorm. Lightning's abrupt electric discharge is accompanied by the emission of light.

The damage to human endeavours from a tornado is a result of the high wind velocity and wind-blown debris, as well as from electromagnetic effects, which frequently cause "freak" occurrences like wood impaling metal or stone, dried grasses (straw) impaling wood or animals and other similar effects inexplicable by fluid dynamics alone - there are some anecdotal accounts of fowl being entirely plucked of their feathers by tornadoes, which could be explained by effects. Tornado winds range from a slow 40 mi/h (65 km/h) at the low end to a possible 300 mi/h (480 km/h) in the strongest storms. Tornado season in is generally March through August, although tornadoes can occur at any time of year. They tend to occur in the afternoons and evenings: over 80 percent of all tornadoes strike between noon and midnight. static electricity Static electricity or electrostatics is a field of science and a class of phenomena involving the imbalanced charge present on an object, typically referring to charge with voltage of sufficient magnitude to produce a spark.

It is bounded on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocea
Tornadoes can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel, though some nocturnal tornadoes have been observed glowing diffusely. Retired U.S. Army captain Roy S. Hall and his family and others who have been inside tornadoes have reported that the inside of tornadoes is very bright and flickering like a fluorescent light bulb. Verified observations by Hall and others suggest a cellular structure inside tornadoes. Some tornadoes are composed of several mini-funnels. A tornado must by definition have both ground and cloud contact. [1] [2]
The United States experiences by far the most tornadoes of any country, and has also suffered the most intense ones. However, tornadoes do occur throughout the world; the most tornado-prone region of the world, as measured by number of tornadoes per unit area, is the , especially . United Kingdom The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a state in Western Europe, usually known simply as the United Kingdom the UK Britain or less accurately as Great Britain . The UK was formed by a series of Acts of Union which united the formerly England [3]

On average, the United States experiences 100,000 thunderstorms each year, resulting in over 1,000 tornadoes and approximately 50 deaths per year. The deadliest US tornado on record is the , that went across southeastern , southern Illinois, and southern Indiana, killing 695 people.

The intensity of tornadoes is given by the (also known simply as ). The intensity can be derived directly with high resolution wind speed data, or ly derived from structural damage compared to engineering data. Also, note that intensity does refer in any way to the size, or width, of a tornado.Fujita-Pearson Tornado Scale Fujita scale Doppler radar empirical not
Trained weather s are often on alert to look for tornadoes and notify local weather agencies when severe weather is occurring or predicted to be imminent. In the United States, spotters, often local , fulfill this role. Additionally, some individuals, known as , enjoy pursuing thunderstorms and tornadoes to explore their many visual and scientific aspects. spotter skywarn sheriff's deputies storm chasers

While tornadoes are frequently coincident with lightning, the hypothesis that electromagnetic phenomena (plasmoid phenomena) may generally or wholly large-scale tornadoes is not widely accepted by others in the field.
2 Tornado characteristics
No two tornadoes look exactly alike. Nor have any two tornadoes behaved exactly the same. There are true incidents of tornadoes repeatedly hitting the same town several years in a row. But forecasting the exact position a tornado will strike at a certain time is nearly impossible.
Not every thunderstorm, supercell, squall line, or hurricane will produce a tornado. Luckily, it takes exactly the right combination of atmospheric variables (wind, temperature, pressure, humidity, etc) to spawn even a weak tornado. On the other hand, roughly 1,000 tornadoes a year are reported in the contiguous US.
Of all tornadoes formed in the US, and tornadoes account for a large percentage of occurrences. On the other end of the scale, the massively destructive tornadoes account for less than 2% of all tornadoes in the US.F0F1F5
Even though no two tornadoes are exactly alike, they always have the same general characteristics that classify them as tornadoes. First, a tornado is a microscale rotating area of wind. A thunderstorm can rotate, but that does not mean it is a tornado. Secondly, the , , must be attached to a convective cloud base, and be in contact with the ground. Some of those are thunderstorms embedded in squal lines, supercell thunderstorms, and also not to exclude the outer fringes of landfalling hurricanes. Third, a spinning vortex of air must have a wind speed above a certain rate to be classified by the as a tornado. vortex rotating wind Fujita scale
According to , the chances of being by a tornado are 12 million to 1 (12,000,000:1). One may revise this yearly and/or regionally, but the probability may be factually stated to be low. Tornadoes do cause millions of dollars in damage, both economic and physical, displacement, and many injuries every year. Environment Canada killed

3 Tornado awareness and safety
Each time tornado season comes around, schools and media outlets in tornado-prone areas spend time educating the public about the dangers and what can be done to improve the chances of surviving a storm. In the United States, citizens are often advised to purchase s. They are relatively inexpensive devices costing as little as US$20 which will activate whenever the issues severe weather warnings. Warnings are also carried on radio and television, and most communities have s that will activate when severe weather is believed to be approaching.

When tornado warnings are issued, members of the public are advised to get into sheltered areas. In most buildings, it is recommended to seek shelter in a central, windowless room or corridor, below ground if possible. If a tornado does strike a building, it can cause debris to rain down on people inside, so it is advisable to crouch under strong beams, in doorways, or under strong furniture. However, light structures such as s are in severe danger when tornadoes and strong winds appear. Residents of such structures are advised to evacuate them whenever severe weather is imminent and seek shelter in sturdier buildings, whether they are designated shelters or the homes of nearby friends. s are also common places of refuge in some regions. mobile home Storm cellar
Vehicles are extremely dangerous in a tornado. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. Otherwise, park the vehicle as quickly and safely as possible -- out of the traffic lanes (it is safer to get the vehicle out of mud later if necessary than to cause a crash) and seek shelter in a sturdy building or ditch. You should not, under any circumstances, stay in a vehicle if the vehicle is in or near the path of a tornado. Vehicles are easily tossed around by the extreme winds created by a tornado.
Some people take shelter underneath bridge overpasses during storms, but they are not considered a safe place to take shelter. The National Weather Service office based in has created a presentation discussing the use of bridges as protection during that occurred on , in the region of where tornadoes passed over three different bridgest least one person was killed in each instance. Bridges vary in construction, and many do not provide any significant protection from the wind and flying debris. Norman, Oklahoma the Oklahoma Tornado Outbreak May 3 1999 Oklahoma City
Some common myths about Tornadoes which people should not rely upon to protect them, are given in the article on of 1974, in which some of the most dangerous tornadoes formed near rivers and crossed them, and crossed over steep hills, mountains and deep valleys. The Super Outbreak
