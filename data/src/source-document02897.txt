You've been taking supplements such as arginine, carnitine, creatine, glutamine and 5-HTP for years. They've helped you get into fighting shape--a lean physique with powerful muscle and athletic prowess. But did you know that some of your favorite nutrition basics have better health implications too? Here's what science is saying about what you're probably taking already. More Than Muscle

"Thwap", yup that is how this all started. You see, one day I was invited to go to a mixed martial arts studio to watch a friend train and lo and behold, since I was a collegiate wrestler I jumped into the fray and mixed it up with a few of the other trainees. This head-banging experience got me thinking a little more about what goes into the training, nutrition and lifestyle of anyone seriously involved with fighting sports. I consider the fighting sports to include boxing, all of the different forms of martial arts, Pride, K1, wrestling (collegiate and Olympic), samba and some other types of the arts. On the ProSource Forum many fighters from various grueling sports are available to interact with you about how they train, eat and plan for their matches.

Ronnie Coleman's incredible physique is a product of superior genetics, long-term training, optimal nutrition and a committed attitude. Clearly, these factors cannot be replaced by the use of dietary supplements.

Muscle building has always been the primary objective for every bodybuilder, whether pro or amateur. With that, there can be no doubt that when it comes to the acquisition of superhuman strength and enviable virility, the male hormone testosterone is definitely the daddy! In fact, you would be hard pressed to find any individual who couldn't benefit from an extra helping of "Big T"--and that includes female athletes, too. Muscle Building and the Quest for Test

B-phenylethylamine (PEA)
Carving out a lean, hard body, with washboard abs is the ultimate goal for bodybuilders. It's what we all should strive for. In the last few years, however, it has been more and more difficult to find truly effective thermogenic supplements to help us get there. Fortunately, there are new thermogenic, fat-burning compounds hitting the market now that are backed by real clinical science and delivering truly outstanding results. Before we get to the good stuff, though, we need to dispel the hype about one particularly ineffective compound being touted in some products, even as we speak.

PEA is an ingredient that is popping up in some purported "weight-loss" formulas, but does it stack up? A critical analysis says not by a long shot. ProSource extensively investigated PEA 4 years ago when developing its Provadex energy supplement, so this is a topic we are intimately familiar with. PEA is a stimulant like substance naturally produced in the body. It is also found in small amounts in chocolate and other foods such as blue-green algae, salami, and bologna. The reason PEA is showing up in some weight-loss and whole health products is because it is a brain chemical that is associated with stimulation of various neurotransmitters in the brain that influence emotions such as euphoria, alertness, and feelings of attraction, as well as suppressing appetite. DOES PEA (PHENYLETHYLAMINE) REALLY WORK?

Eons ago, pre-humans evolved big brains, which allowed us to avoid or beat-out predators, maximize our reproductive potential, and populate the whole planet at the expense of other species. And we've obviously done a great job at that! The brain is of course a tissue, and has nutritional needs like any other tissue. But it is also a special tissue with special influences, like determining your mood and level of motivation, the perceived difficulty of a workout, your level of concentration during a workout, and your willingness to train at all. Fortunately, the non-prescription world of nutrients and herbal extracts provides great tools to optimize brain function and get that grey matter working for you instead of against you.

the top 5 science-based muscle-building compounds
With all the new supplements hitting the market on a near-daily basis, there are undoubtedly some hidden gems that get ignored. Not the new, fancy ones, mind you, but the timeless mainstays of bodybuilding's past, the supplements forever known for packing an extra inch of muscle on your arms, yet have somehow fallen in popularity. Branched-chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are precisely one of those supplements - not quite relegated to obscurity, but nevertheless overlooked. Branched-Chain Amino Acids: A Blast From the Supplement Past

Is it possible to develop the perfect workout and bottle it? Could you gather up all the intensity, the unexpected strength, the supercharged endurance, the freaky pumps, and guarantee it every time you step in the gym?

Bodybuilding Supplements, Insulin, Amino Acids & Protein Anabolism: Appropriate resistance exercise leads to significant increase in skeletal muscle mass (hypertrophy), which can occur through an increase in muscle protein synthesis, a decrease in muscle protein degradation, or both. While stimulus (i.e., resistance exercise) is important for muscle hypertrophy, nutrient availability plays a critical factor in regulating the degree of hypertrophy. Obviously, the muscle's hormonal milieu also has a major impact on muscle protein synthesis. Search for the Ultimate Post-Exercise Bodybuilding Supplements: the Anabolic Edge.

With new and exciting supplement breakthroughs making their debut all the time, it's sometimes easy to forget the less glamorous nutritional stand-bys of muscle growth. Yes, the new norepinephrine-stimulating super-thermogenics and the muscle-gorging hemodilators (to pick two examples), show terrific anabolic potential. But real lean mass gains start with the basics. And the most basic and essential building block of all is the branched-chain amino acid.

Creatine is a nitrogenous amine. Normal daily dietary intake of creatine from an omnivorous diet is about 1 gram. Dietary sources of creatine include meat, fish, and other animal products, but it may also be formed endogenously in the liver, kidney, and pancreas from the amino acids glycine, arginine, and methionine. One-half kg of fresh, uncooked steak contains about 2 grams of creatine. Creatine has become an extremely popular nutritional ergogenic among athletes. In 1998, about $200 million was spent on creatine monohydrate (the most studied form of creatine). Of the approximately 300 studies that have evaluated the potential performance-enhancing (ergogenic) value of creatine monohydrate supplementation, about 70% of these studies report statistically significant results while remaining studies generally report non-significant gains in performance.1 Creatine Supplementation Strategies: Update (posted 02/21/2007)
