The branch libraries provide a full complement of library services including children's programming, reference and Interlibrary Loan service, displays and exhibits, adult programs and more. The scope of these services varies from one branch to another depending on funding, size, staff, and hours open. Home delivery of library materials is provided free to patrons who are physically unable to visit the library, including the elderly, the disabled, and those who are temporarily incapacitated by illness or accident. While every effort will be made to insure that the reading needs of patrons who are homebound are met, some restrictions may be necessary. As a general guideline, no more than 30 books will be delivered per visit. Please contact the Outreach Library Assistant at 706-613-3650, ext 320 for additional information. Book deposit collections are available to area nursing homes, assisted living centers, senior residences and other group facilities. Materials are rotated on a quarterly basis.

This program delivers story time programs, thematic crates of library materials and book deposit collections to low income day care centers in the area.
