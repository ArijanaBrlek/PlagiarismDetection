Culpeper National Cemetery Soldier Search
Description
This exciting program is geared to the older student and incorporates "hands-on" learning with a "minds-on" adventure in a search for histories at the Culpeper National Cemetery. After hearing a presentation on the history of the cemetery, students are assigned a specific solder, locate his grave, and record the information found on the gravestone. As an option participants may hear of the story of the lone Confederate soldier and visit his grave.A teacher may develop this activity in a variety of ways from a simple "bio" to a full-blown essay or possible a creative first person account. There are numerous sources of additional information.
