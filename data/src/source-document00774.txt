100% whole food vitamin and mineral supplements synthetic vitamin and mineral supplements
While I firmly believe that regular use of whole food supplements can ensure optimal health, I also believe that your primary source of natural vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients and macronutrients should be fresh, whole foods (locally grown, whenever possible).
What follows is a list of all of the major vitamins and minerals that you need to be at your best, as well as common healthy foods that are naturally rich in each vitamin and mineral.
If your health research leads you to believe that you need to consume more of any particular vitamin or mineral, before you turn to whole food supplements, I encourage you to focus on eating more whole foods that are rich in the vitamins and/or minerals that you need.
