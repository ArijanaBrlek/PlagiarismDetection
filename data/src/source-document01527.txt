  Can''t get the games to wor../ Wanda, MD

It looks neat. I loaded the disk and tried both ways to play the games. One was from the disk and one I downloaded the games. It all works fine until I go to play a game I click on the game I want and the screen goes Black nothing happens. I will see if I can get help with this through a friend or I will send it back. I have a new computer so should work fine. If anyone can help with answeres would be grateful....Thanks I would have rated it higher if I could get a chance to play the games....
