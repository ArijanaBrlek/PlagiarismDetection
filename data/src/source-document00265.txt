 
General Information
Replacing worldly concerns with a world of comfort. Its our pleasure. Escape to the peaceful, rejuvenating solitude of The Ritz-Carlton Spa Lake Las Vegas.
          
Transportation to the Strip
Lake Las Vegas is just 17 miles from the world-famous Las Vegas Strip. When the sun sets, the "Entertainment Capital of the World" is just 25 minutes away. Ask our concierge about the numerous modes of transportation to the Strip. Private car service and rental cars are available. (At least four hours notice is recommended.) Call valet at 702-567-4380 to order a taxi cab. (At least one hour notice is recommended.)
Airport Transportation
Airport transportation options include taxis, private cars and limousine services, with a one-way price to the hotel of about $70 plus gratuity. Because Las Vegas does offers so many things to see and do, many guests find a rental car to be the most practical option, especially since self-parking at the resort and at most casinos on the Strip is free.
          
Climate
With its dramatic high Mojave Desert setting, Lake Las Vegas differs from many southwest resort communities. Its comfortable 2,000-ft. altitude ensures the air is fresh and dry and the hottest days of summer are both cooler and shorter in duration than those of many warmer desert resort destinations in Arizona and California. Whatever the season, guests can expect comfortably low humidity, plenty of blue skies and abundant sunshine. In the height of summer, primarily July and early August, the mercury often rises above 100F (38C). The low humidity of the area can make this peak heat relatively comfortable. Summer evenings tend to be especially spectacular. Winters are cooler and bring moderate to cool temperatures, with daytime highs of around 60F (16C) and chilly nights averaging 40F (4C). Rain is minimal, falling largely in fall and winter and on those rare summer afternoons when brief thunderstorms quickly move through.
Tennis and Fishing
The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Las Vegas does not have its own tennis courts but hotel guests may utilize nearby private courts offered by Lake Las Vegas. The rate is $15 per person for 90 minutes of play. Reservations can be made by contacting concierge directly at 702-567-4781. We suggest making reservations about one month prior to play. Lake Las Vegas is a catch and release lake with no fishing license required. Please contact the concierge to book equipment or instruction.
Activities & Excursions
Besides the myriad entertainment, dining and shopping options available on the Las Vegas Strip, southern Nevada offers numerous museums and cultural experiences (the Liberace Museum, Atomic Energy Museum, Natural History Museum, Lied Discovery Childrens Museum, Bonnie Springs Ranch and more). Consider ATV and SUV tours of our many scenic areas as well as touring or hiking at majestic parks like Red Rock Canyon, Lake Mead National Recreation Area and the Valley of Fire. Please note that each location is at least one hour from our resort. Lake Mead Cruises, race car driving school at Las Vegas Motor Speedway (about 90 minutes from the resort), kayaking and rafting on the Colorado River and even painting tours are conveniently available to resort guests, while children also can enjoy many entertainment options, from rides to museums to beach and aquarium adventures.
