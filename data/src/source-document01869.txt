Now that you are a professional entertainer, you’ll certainly want to make the most amount of money possible for your services. Since you are just starting out, you will obviously have no reputation in the industry though. This is why it is to your advantage to subcontract work through an established and reputable company. It is also very beneficial if the company charges a good amount of money for their services. This will help you later.
On the days that you can generate your own bookings, you probably won't be able to charge as much as the company that you are subcontracting through, but you will be keeping the whole amount, so it will make you more money. Use this to your advantage.
Do the best job possible. This way when clients that have seen you at these parties call you, you will be able to justify a price comparable to that of an established company. They will know the prices, because they will probably have called around. Plus they will know that you are a top notch professional because they have seen you live.
Video Footage
An excellent way of obtaining work when you are new to this field, as well as when you are more established, is by the use of video footage. By having a professionally edited video production of your services (preferrably at a wedding) for clients to view, you will pick up a lot more jobs and at higher pay also.
e with you if they haven't seen you. Now with the video, this is not a factor. You're right there in front of their eyes. You can even send the video tape to their home in the mail with a letter from your company. Call back in a few days to schedule a time for you to pick up the video. Now they've seen your tape, you're in their home, and they can get a feel for your personality. You should easily get a deposit check and book the job.Without the video, the client will not feel as secur
With today’s technology, it is even possible to put video clips of your DJ service in action on the Internet. Now clients can view them at their home 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Imagine, you’re sleeping and someone is watching you do wedding introductions in another state. The next day they call you and book you. Incredible!
Let's talk about subcontracted work. Once you provide service for a client, they are comfortable with you. In essence, they become your client. If the DJ company that you obtained the job from charged that client $1,195.00 for their party, then that same client will be willing to pay you the same amount of money for your services. It is you that they want.
It is through subcontracting work for about a period of a year or two, while picking up as much work as possible on your own, that you will establish a reputation in this field. Once your reputation spreads, your rate of pay is clearly defined. This is why you want to be an entertianer and motivator as much as possible. Anyone can play music. A juke box can do that. Be unique, original, and entertaining, and you will command the big money!
