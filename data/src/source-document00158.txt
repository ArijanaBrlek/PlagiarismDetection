Imagine camping on the banks of the legendary Blackfoot River. The soft music of the water lulls you gently to sleep while a blanket of stars twinkles overhead. Rise with the sun and cast your first fly into the pristine water. Now imagine doing it Paws Up-style - with your own 270-square-foot, well-appointed tent complete with king-sized bed, electricity, spacious deck, nearby private master bathroom, twice-daily housekeeping service, gourmet meals and even your own personal butler. That's River Camp at Paws Up - where nature is served on a silver platter. This luxury camp features six riverside residences are unlike any "tents" you've ever seen before. All River Camp guests will enjoy luxurious amenities including The Last Best BedÂ®, outfitted in sumptuous bedding as natural as the wilderness around you. You'll feast on indigenous cuisine at The Dining Pavilion at River Camp while taking in breathtaking views of the Blackfoot River - the same majestic river that inspired the novel and hit movie, "A River Runs Through It." We call this new kind of camping, "glamping" (short for glamorous camping). You'll just call it unforgettable. Want to explore the outdoors and sleep under the open skies but covet creature comforts? Welcome to the world of "glamping": for those who only want to sleep under 'five stars'. When was the last time you went "glamping"? Come, experience it at The Last Best Place in Montana.
