Founded in 1983, The Hudson Reporter publishes nine weekly newspapers, capturing the highest home-delivered circulation of any newspaper in Hudson County. Our award-winning periodicals also include specialty publications and two, glossy magazines: Jersey City Magazine and Palisade. The past few years have brought tremendous change to the western banks of the Hudson River. As newcomers flock to the area and explore their surroundings, long-time residents are meeting their neighbors - and discovering new opportunities - at every turn. Luxury developments line the riverbanks, and boutiques, restaurants and art galleries are opening every week. Young families fill the streets with baby carriages. Empty nesters and young artists wait together for trains running along the expanding light rail system. But change can be hard. Transformation does not come easily. How does one gain a sense of community in a new and evolving place? Where can you turn for resources, entertainment and a bird's-eye view of our home along the Hudson? We created hudsonreporter.com to answer some of those questions, yet we hope it will do more. We'd like our site to be a sort of meeting place a town square, if you will, where you can read about the people, politics and places that make living here so exciting.
