Cant wait till next week! Question. Lots of games you have seen or been part of in some way. Of the ones you didn't get to see live what event do you most wish to have been there to catch?

Looking forward to hearing more Bill. Since you've been involved (and revolutionized the way we watch sports) for over 50 years, whats your most memorable games, season, interviews, etc.? Also, since you brought up the BCS, will we ever see a national champ via a playoff in our lifetime? Finally, Vandy's off to a great start, but I like the Cubs chances of winning the world series before Vandy is crowned national champ.

Okay Bill, I know I am going to sound like someone from a different planet (to other bloggers anyway, I doubt that you will be surprised) but here goes. I am a greenhorn when it comes to certain sports and as dumb as a doornail at understanding anything about it unless it's written down on paper. For people like us, it will be nice to see a section with a step by step tutorial on sports like Football (Rugby to me), Lacrosse (which is totally new to me) and baseball. Although I am not totally hopeless (I can understand other sports), I just cannot get these three. Help!!!

Where's your favorite place to watch a college football game? Are there any special places we should visit this fall, for a great campus experience?

Bill, If you went on a speaking tour talking to high school athletes/students and could take one college athlete and one coach with you, who would you take? The topic would be sportmanship, honor, and the spirit of college sports.

I'm a huge fan of college sports and looking to work in sports administration.
