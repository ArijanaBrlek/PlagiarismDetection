 
Alt 1: Overview of Music Theory and History
Rationale:  Students and DSA receive excellent performance instruction.  However, there has been a need perceived by administration, faculty, parents, and the students themselves, for additional training in Music History, Sight-singing, Ear Training, and Music Theory.  There is also a desire among all these groups that students work in a broader context with the entire faculty, rather than solely with their major teachers.5.  Music of the Romantic Period 6.  Music of the Impressionists 7.  Music of the 20th Century _____________________________________________________________________
 
The Alt1 curriculum is designed to afford students general knowledge in Music History and all aspects of Music Theory and to allow the students to work with the entire faculty.  It will provide basic knowledge that will serve as the foundation for subsequent course offerings.
 
Students in the course will meet twice a week for 52 minutes, and will rotate among the music faculty at DSA.

COURSE OFFERINGS -- FALL SEMESTER -- ALT. 1
___________________________________________________________________
 
- Dave Hammond - Fall Semester 2008 - DSA   The largest problem most student musicians have in sight reading/singing is deciphering and interpreting rhythm.  In this class, a system of rhythm counting and execution will be taught. Students will be given the tools needed to be able to translate any rhythm.  Along with this the following will be taught in-depth: time signatures, rhythmic subdivision, odd time signatures, odd groupings, and rhythmic feels.   Music calligraphy will also, be taught in this class in-depth.  In order for students to be able to prepare original music for other students, they will have to present the music in a readable format. This component will be ongoing with the rhythm section of the class, teaching students correct notational skills with clarity and ease of reading as the goal.   The combination of these two critical content areas is mutually beneficial in that the study of one assists and supports the other.Rhythm/Notation Class

  - Mr. Lassen and Mr. FyockThe Periods of Music History
To become a well-rounded musician, the student should understand the history of
music and musicians.  There is an incredible wealth of information that can assist
the performer in understanding styles, performance practice, and emphases of
various style periods.  Along with this understanding, there is a need that students
listen to music of all style periods to get a better grasp of performance practice. 
The Periods of Music History will assist the student in this understanding.
The course will present and overview of styles that include:
1.  Music of Ancient Greece and the Middle Ages 2.  Music of the Renaissance 3.  Music of the Baroque 4.  Music of the Classical Period
