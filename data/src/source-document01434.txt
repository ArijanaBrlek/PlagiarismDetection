Social Studies is a great subject to teach in a multisensory manner. You can study geography, cultures, history, religion, and other topics through a wide variety of hands-on activities. You can visit museums, historical sites, create skits or plays, dress up in costumes of the day, cook food in an "old-fashioned" way, and more!

National Geographic video / DVD rental program! Through this program, you can tap the vast National Geographic library for tons of learning videos. This is an excellent resource I highly recommend, particularly for those who don't live near a library that provides a wide selection of educational videos. There is NO affiliate program.. I don't get a dime for your rentals, but find this is a great option for visual learners. Check out the National Geographic rentals by clicking on the title above.
Hands-On History DVDs & Videos These DVDs and Videos offer additional content on history and are presented from an exploratory standpoing. The Hands-On History series is a great way to incorporate aspects of history into your child's learning without having them feel like they are learning history. Our children love this series and we are able to use it for viewing in the evening.
Likewise, offers a video rental program, but I can't find the link to their rental program right now! Discovery Channel
