a good "Basic First Aid" link? Found Let Us Know!
Buy some NEW! Self-Aid/Buddy-Aid, contains instructions for performing self-aid/buddy-aid (first aid) tasks that all soldiers are required to know. All of the tasks within this subcourse contain important, lifesaving information. This subcourse reflects the current thought of the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School and conforms to printed Department of the Army doctrine as closely as possible. Development and progress render such doctrine continuously subject to change. Feel free to copy and distribute, but please use your own server for all drawings and photos. Don't be a bandwidth thief! This is the Self-Aid/Buddy Aid course (above) on steroids. It includes a few more details and procedures (like IV administration) and is a certification course allowing the non-medic to carry an aid bag. The combat lifesaver is a bridge between the self-aid/buddy-aid (first aid) training given all soldiers during basic training and the medical training given to the combat medic. The combat lifesaver is a non-medical soldier who provides lifesaving measures as a secondary mission as his primary (combat) mission allows. The combat lifesaver may also assist the combat medic in providing care and preparing casualties for evacuation when the combat lifesaver has no combat duties to perform. Normally, one member of each squad, team, crew, or equivalent-sized unit will be trained as a combat lifesaver. When you have casualties on the battlefield, you must determine the sequence in which the casualties are to be treated and how to treat their injuries. This subcourse discusses the procedures for performing tactical combat casualty care; treating injuries to the extremities, chest, abdominal, and head; and controlling shock. Other subcourses in the Health Care Specialist series provide instruction on treating various wounds and injuries. Many times, the last step given in the treatment instructions is to evacuate the casualty to a medical treatment facility. This subcourse describes procedures for evacuating casualties to a medical treatment facility or to a point where they can be picked up by an evacuation vehicle and transported to a medical treatment facility. In this subcourse, you will study basic human anatomy. Anatomy is the study of body structure. Physiology is the study of body functions. Anatomy and physiology are two subject matter areas that are vitally important to most medical MOSs. Do your best to achieve the objectives of this subcourse. As a result, you will be better able to perform your job or medical MOS. See also: Medical terminology is the professional language of those who are directly or indirectly engaged in the art of healing. You will need to know medical terms in order to read a medical record, to complete forms, to decipher a physician's handwriting, and to communicate with others in the hospital in a professional manner. At first, the medical terms may seem strange and bewildering to you and appear to be extremely difficult to learn. Fortunately, there is a logical method found in medical terminology. Many of the words used in medicine are made up of parts which are also used in other words. Once you know the meanings of the basic parts of the words, you can put them together to understand the meanings of many medical terms. These basic parts of medical terms are called stems, prefixes, and suffixes. During this course, you will learn to identify and define a stem, a prefix, and a suffix. You will also learn how they are used in combination to describe a medical term. You will also benefit from a thorough knowledge of and Vital (life) signs are very important. They tell you and other medical personnel about the patient's present condition. By maintaining a record of a patient's vital signs, the effectiveness of the medical treatment that the patient receives can be evaluated. This subcourse provides you with information you need in order to take a person's vital signs. The musculoskeletal system is composed of osseous (bone) tissue and muscle tissue. Both are essential parts of the complex structure that is the body. The skeletal system has a major role in the total structure of the body, but bones and joints alone cannot produce movement. Together, skeletal tissue and muscle tissue are important parts of the functioning of the body as a whole. The skin is not just a simple thin covering which keeps the body together. The skin is a complex combination of tissues that perform functions necessary for human survival. Our skin helps maintain body temperature, receives stimuli from the environment, and stores chemical compounds. Consider the human predicament if the skin were not waterproof. Every time it rained, each human would absorb water like a sponge. The skin also acts as a protective covering keeping underlying tissues from bacterial invasion and harmful light rays and from drying out. As a Medical NCO, it is important for you to understand the complex functions of the skin. Today, more than 8 million Americans are affected by renal-related diseases. This fact suggests that you will probably deal with renal patients often. Add to this the complex human reproductive system by which a single cell duplicates its genetic material, allowing an organism to grow and repair itself. To give patients with problems in either or both systems the best possible care, you need to know normal anatomy and physiology of the systems, specific disorders in each system, assessment methods, and treatments. Regardless of the cause or the duration of the problem, it is important for you as a combat medical specialist to be able to recognize and treat/refer for treatment any individual with genitourinary system difficulties. For more advanced information on treatment of STD's and other disorders, see In this subcourse, you will study the gastrointestinal system. This system processes food so that it can be used by the body. Chemical reactions occur in each body cell. Some chemical reactions synthesize new enzymes, cell structures, bone, and other components of the body. Other chemical reactions release energy needed for the building processes. The foods we eat are usually too large to pass through the membranes of the body's cells. The organs of the gastrointestinal system break down food molecules for use by the cells of the body and eliminate the waste products the body cannot use. Knowledge of the gastrointestinal system is vitally important to most medical MOSs. The central nervous system is one of the two principal divisions of the body's nervous system. The nervous system is the body's communication network and control center. The central nervous system (CNS), consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, is the control center for the entire nervous system. All the sensations of the body are relayed to the central nervous system. All nerve impulses that cause muscles to contract and glands to secrete come from the central nervous system. As a medical NCO, it is of vital importance for you to understand the complex functions of the central nervous system. Two systems, the nervous system and the endocrine system, work together to regulate and integrate the processes of the body. The activities of these systems operate like an interlocking supersystem. Some parts of the nervous system stimulate the release of hormones while some parts of the endocrine system stimulate nerve impulses. In this subcourse, you will study the endocrine system, its anatomy, physiology, diseases, and disorders. A particular disease, diabetes mellitus, will also be studied. Do your best to achieve the objective of this subcourse. As a result, you will be better able to perform functions of your medical MOS. The sensory system by which we see, smell, taste, and hear is often taken for granted until we lose one or more of these senses. From the time we are born, our senses shape our view of the world and transmit those impulses to the brain which trigger an adaptive response. The importance of becoming familiar with the sensory structures is fundamental to the Medical NCO due to the structures' innate sensitivity and key role in daily life. In the process of achieving and maintaining proficiency in your military occupational specialty (MOS), you will be learning concepts and performing tasks that are based on important chemical principles. As you become more proficient with these principles, you may reach the point where you will not need to give them much conscious thought. Meanwhile, however, you should study this subcourse to gain a working knowledge of the fundamental principles of chemistry. Another good addition at this level would be and , followed by In this subcourse, you will study cardiac arrest; basic life support, to include rescue breathing; chest compressions; and recognition and treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias. This information will aid you in maintaining and improving the health of soldiers. When you have casualties on the battlefield, you must determine the sequence in which the casualties are to be treated and how to treat their injuries. This subcourse discusses the procedures for performing primary and secondary surveys; performing triage; treating open and closed injuries of the extremities, chest, abdominal, and head; and controlling shock. One of the more common injuries on a battlefield or in everyday life is a fracture. Although usually not immediately life-threatening, serious fractures can be fatal if not properly treated. This subcourse discusses the procedures for immobilizing fractures and dislocations of the extremities using traction splints, wire ladder splints, SAM splints, pneumatic splints, and improvised splints. The subcourse also covers immobilizing a casualty with a suspected fracture of the spine. Other subcourses in the Health Care Specialist series provide instruction on treating various wounds and injuries. Many times, the last step given in the treatment instructions is to evacuate the casualty to a medical treatment facility. This subcourse describes procedures for evacuating casualties to a medical treatment facility or to a point where they can be picked up by an evacuation vehicle and transported to a medical treatment facility. As a member of the Army Medical Department, you are expected to know how to perform basic lifesaving procedures in an emergency. Such emergencies can occur anywhere -- on the battlefield, in your home, in a restaurant, or on the highway. In such an emergency, a person's life may depend upon your knowledge of what to do and upon your ability to do the procedure properly and quickly. This subcourse provides instruction which will enable you to remove an obstruction from a casualty's airway, restore respiration to a casualty who has stopped breathing, and restore blood circulation to a casualty whose heart has stopped beating. Instruction is provided for performing these procedures for an adult casualty, a child, and an infant. Study and know these procedures BEFORE you are faced with an emergency. In this subcourse, you will study wound healing and wound care, contaminated wounds, and burns. Information you read in this subcourse will aid you in maintaining and improving the health of soldiers. In that pursuit, do your best to achieve the objectives of this subcourse. The medical soldier caring for patients provides a valuable service to his comrades. He must meet high standards with integrity, dignity, calm thinking, and careful study. The purpose of this subcourse is to provide you with a working knowledge of the procedures discussed herein; however, you must receive guidance and hands-on supervision to become proficient at the procedures described: Hygiene and Care of the Patient, Positioning the Patient, Caring for the Patient's Environment, Specimen Collection and Handwashing Procedures. As a medical specialist, you will treat patients with eye, ear, and nose injuries. These injuries can be very sensitive to the patient. You must use extreme care when working with these patients. This subcourse describes procedures for treating and dressing injuries to the eye, irrigating and applying medication to the eye, irrigating the ear, and treating nosebleed. and the Control of Diarrheal Diseases (Peace Corps, 1985, 566 p.)

AgSafe, Coalition for Health and Safety in Agriculture By George E. Dvorchak Jr. M.A., M.D. - Text file also available in . See also:    7 Pages This subcourse on environmental disease and injuries includes sections on venomous snake bites, spider bites, insect stings and bites, anaphylactic shock, poisonous marine animals, and hepatitis. The identification of types of snake bites and types of venoms is the main concern of the section on snakes. The snakes described here will be found mainly in the United States. For those soldiers assigned to other parts of the world, supplementary information will be provided by proper persons when an assignment is made. It is not possible to include all species of snakes and their varieties in this subcourse. A LAC-USC Guide for Snake Venom Poisoning is included at the end of the first lesson. The spiders that are identified can be as lethal as some types of snakes, but many of the insects are not. These insects are included because they are medically important, in terms of pain and the possibility of an allergic reaction. Many people can show an allergy that will progress to anaphylactic shock. Some types of marine life can emit a poison that is more lethal than that of any snake, and many military personnel are stationed at, or near the habitats of these animals. The lesson on hepatitis identifies the various types of this disease. The routes of person to person transmission, and disease precautions, will be of special interest. This subcourse deals with environmental and climatic injuries including snakebites, insect and spider bites, insect and scorpion stings, dermatitis caused by toxic plants, heat injuries, and cold injuries. Some of the injuries discussed in this subcourse can result in death if not treated promptly and properly. The medical specialist must recognize when the dangers discussed in this subcourse are present and take the appropriate preventive measures to protect himself and other soldiers. Throughout history, infectious organisms have plagued society. Biblical accounts of plagues attest to this fact. In London in the 1600s, the Black Plague killed thousands of people. In a combat situation, the impact of disease on the combat soldier cannot be overstated. In every war in which the American soldier has fought, there have been more casualties caused by disease than by combat wounds. An outbreak of a simple intestinal disease in a combat zone can greatly affect the morale and fighting strength of the Army. Information concerning the identification, treatment, and preventive measures for arthropod-borne, animal-borne, and helminthic diseases will be discussed in this subcourse. As a Medical NCO, it is extremely important that you are aware of the prevention and treatments for the numerous diseases which you will encounter. With the awareness of those diseases, their general characteristics, modes of transmission, and clinical findings, you may be alert for either treatment or prevention. Huge medical bulletin is unfortunately presented in an optical scan format, but is an important document for those anticipating activities above 8,000 feet in altitude. This document covers hypoxia and factors other than hypoxia, acclimatization, acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, solar intensity, nutrition and fluid balance and more. While on a technical level, much of the bulletin is above basic skill levels - but most of the information can be retained to some degree and returned to after more advance training. Again, this bulletin probably exceeds the skill level abilities of the basic care-giver, but is a good introduction to the dangers, complexities and variables associated with high temperature environments. With a good medical dictionary and diligent efforts, one might be able to grasp 90% of the information... but without advanced training (and interest) I would suggest simply passing over the big words/concepts and soaking in whatever makes obvious sense to you. You can come back to this bulletin after more advanced training. Along the same lines, but for low temperature environments is the somewhat less intense , which should be a bit easier to assimilate. : Medical emergencies don't occur every day. But when they do, information can help you deal with these situations. This index contains an A-Z list of common conditions presented to first responders.
