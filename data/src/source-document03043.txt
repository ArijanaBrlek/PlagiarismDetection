El Protector
CHP's Traffic Safety Community Outreach Program
Since 1987, the CHP has been proactively involved in a traffic safety outreach program, , directed at the Hispanic community. It places special emphasis on educating through dialogue with the community, instead of focusing on enforcement measures. Such community opportunities arise at local neighborhood/town hall meetings, educational functions, media and at other community related forums.El Protector
The goal of the El Protector Program is to reduce the disproportionate number of Hispanic surnamed drivers and victims involved in traffic related collisions. Activities are designed to educate and encourage positive traffic safety behavior and to build better community relations between the community and law enforcement agencies.
The driving force and focus of this programis the use of a CHP officer of Hispanic ancestry or officers that are bilingual and bicultural - known as the El Protector Program Coordinator. The coordinator organizes community events, provides traffic safety education presentations and serves as a Hispanic role model.
Presently, the Statewide El Protector Coordinator can be contacted at the Office of Community Outreach and Recruitment at (916) 657-8810. The following is a list of local locations in your area and their telephone numbers:
