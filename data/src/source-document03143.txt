Hughes Aircraft contributed to World War II by manufacturing armaments and radio equipment. Its role increased after the war to include advanced radar systems and radar guided missiles. Hughes Aircraft researched and developed applications for modern missiles, including guidance by not only radar but also lasers, wires, optical fibers, video and infrared imaging sensors.
