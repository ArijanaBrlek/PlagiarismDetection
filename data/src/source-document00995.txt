In September 1781 British troops under raided and burned New London in the with the objective of ending the harassment at sea. Fort Griswold had a key strategic position above the , but the British knew the fort's inner workings thanks to the who gave numerous secrets of American defenses to the British forces he commanded. Arnold, knowing Griswold's layout and precise position, approached the harbor from such an angle that Griswold's gun positions could never draw an effective shot on the British fleet. Arnold's troops eventually made landfall, and the fort's garrison fought back. Artillery barrages and fire brought (relatively) heavy casualties to each side, the fighting continuing even past commands to stop. The British eventually captured the fort and tried to destroy it, though the plan was foiled as a patriot put out the British fire before it could reach Griswold's gunpowder stores. When Benedict Arnold finally made it in, Colonel Ledyard surrendered, gave him his sword, and said that Arnold was now in charge. Arnold stabbed Colonel Ledyard with his own sword. Arnold only commanded a party, not a conquering force, so the fort was abandoned as Arnold left New London in flames. Benedict Arnold Battle of Groton Heights Thames River turncoat musket raiding
