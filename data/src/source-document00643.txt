Maps of South America
Archeological evidence indicates that Indians moving south from North America had settled in what is now Brazil by at least 12,000 to 10,000 B.C. (Some archeologists believe that the first migration to Brazil may have taken place as early as 30,000 years ago.) Indians who settled in the Amazon Basin became farmers living in simple thatched-roof dwellings. Stone tools and weapons found along the east coast suggest that the Indians who settled in that area probably lived by hunting and fishing.
