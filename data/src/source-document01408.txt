The trombonesform the middle of the orchestral brass section. They fill out the harmonies between the trumpets and the horns on top, and the low tuba below. They've been around a while. While Columbus was busy discovering America 500 years ago, King Henry VII had a band of four trombones. They were called back then, but they were very like today's trombones. The modern trombone has a rich tenor voice.sackbuts

Mostbrass instruments use valves to produce different pitches. But the trombone uses a slide instead. Look at our trombonist, Frida, and you'll see how it works. She pushes and pulls the slide back and forth to change the length of tubing - which changes the pitch. She can play individual pitches, or gradually change the pitch by buzzing air continuously through the mouthpiece as she moves the trombone slide.
The trombone has a flared bell. The total length of an unwound trombone tube is 9 feet!
