   Welcome   
Group Tours
If you have a group tour pre-scheduled on a closed date, please be patient. The Springfield Convention and Visitors Bureau, who operates the Central Reservation System for the sites, is aware of the situation and will be contacting all of the groups scheduled, in date order, to make adjustments to the schedules. For obvious reasons, schedules need to be changed immediately for those groups with tours scheduled in the near future. These schedule changes are a top priority, so you will hear from someone at the Bureau very soon.
Our audio archive lists site histories, the original sound and light show from the Old State Capitol in Springfield, and a walking tour of the historic buildings at the Illinois State Fairgrounds.
