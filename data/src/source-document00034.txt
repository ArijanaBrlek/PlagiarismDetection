Disneyland Attraction Poster on Canvas - Submarine Voyage (from Sanders CC Gallery)
As close as one can come to visiting The Big Easy, New Orleans Square is a picture-perfect sampling of one of America's most beloved cities, known locally as N'awlins. This Southern haven of unique shops and elaborate mansions almost resounds with echoes of the past - years of Mardi Gras celebrations with the laughter of the masses, loud and bold brass bands and the sound of thousands of plastic trinkets scattering along the streets as they're tossed from balconies and rooftops to the crowds below. On afternoons when the sun is captured by storm clouds, thunder rolls in the distance; one can't help but think about the days when pirate ships sailed the waters and opened fire on unsuspecting ports of call and other vessels going about their business. Between the relentless scent of Cajun fixin's and the mouth-watering appeal of a cool mint julep on a sweltering hot summer day, it's easy to think of 999 reasons to spend some time in New Orleans Square just soakin' up the attitude, atmosphere and Southern hospitality!  Slow Moving Car No   Thrill: 2.0   Theme: 3.0    Infant:   Child:   Pre-Teen:   Teen/Young Adult: 4.0  Adult: 3.0  Older Adult:     Slow Moving Car Yes   Thrill: 1.3   Theme: 1.3    Infant:   Child: 3.6  Pre-Teen: 3.8  Teen/Young Adult: 3.9  Adult: 3.9  Older Adult: 3.9    Slow Moving Car Yes   Thrill: 3.0   Theme: 3.0    Infant:   Child: 3.0  Pre-Teen: 3.5  Teen/Young Adult: 3.6  Adult: 3.6  Older Adult: 4.0    Slow Moving Boat Yes   Thrill: 1.0   Theme: 1.3    Infant:   Child: 3.8  Pre-Teen: 3.8  Teen/Young Adult: 4.0  Adult: 4.0  Older Adult: 4.0    Exhibit No   Thrill: Unrated   Theme: Unrated    Infant:   Child: 2.5  Pre-Teen: 3.3  Teen/Young Adult: 3.3  Adult: 3.2  Older Adult: 2.0
