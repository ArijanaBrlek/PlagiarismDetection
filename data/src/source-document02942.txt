Touching poems to salute all mothers, whether they're still with us or not, and funny stories to bring a smile to brighten mother's day.
 
You can see it in their eyes, in tender hugs and long good-byes, a love that only moms and daughters know.
You can see it in their smiles, through passing years and changing styles, a friendship that continually seems to grow.
You can see it in their lives, the joy each one of them derives, in just knowing that the other one is there...
To care and to understand, lend an ear or hold a hand, and to celebrate the memories they share.
 
Once upon a memory Someone wiped away a tear Held me close and loved me, Thank you, Mother dear.
 
 
Mom, I loved you yesterday, I love you tomorrow and everyday. You were there for me my first day of school, to hold my hand and give me courage to go. You listened to me when I needed to talk, you talked to me when I needed to listen. You let me grow and learn from my own mistakes. You never left my side when I was feeling down, I knew you would be there to pick me up. I wish there was a way I could repay all the things you have done for me, but there's nothing great enough to repay the greatest mother of all.
 
 
Dear Lord, it's such a hectic day With little time to stop and pray For life's been anything but calm Since You called on me to be a mom Running errands, matching socks Building dreams with building blocks Cooking, cleaning, and finding shoes And other stuff that children lose Fitting lids on bottled bugs Wiping tears and giving hugs A stack of last weeks mail to read So where's the quiet time I need? Yet when I steal a minute, Lord Just at the sink or ironing board To ask the blessings of Your grace I see then, in my small one's face That you have blessed me All the while And I stop to kiss That precious smile
 
 
Another Mother's Day is here, Bringing joy and pleasures new, On this special day, Mother dear, I want to remember you. I cannot give you costly gifts, And I've told you this before, No matter what I give to you, You give back much, much more. I'm giving you a pure, sweet rose, Gathered in the early morn, This rose you planted in my heart, The day that I was born. In kindly, loving thoughts of you, And with the faith you still impart, The rose I give to you today, Is the love that's in my heart.
 
 
.Mothers Who are No Longer Among Us
These are in memory of my own dear mother who passed away in the autumn of the year 2000. She is still deeply missed
 
In tears we saw you sinking, And watched you pass away. Our hearts were almost broken, We wanted you to stay. But when we saw you sleeping, So peaceful, free from pain, How could we wish you back with us, To suffer that again. It broke our hearts to lose you, But you did not go alone, For part of us went with you, The day God took you home.
 
If Roses grow in Heaven, Lord please pick a bunch for me, Place them in my Mother's arms and tell her they're from me. Tell her I love her and miss her, and when she turns to smile, place a kiss upon her cheek and hold her for awhile. Because remembering her is easy, I do it every day, but there's an ache within my heart that will never go away.
 
Don't think of her as gone away Her journey's just begun Life holds so many facets This earth is only one Just think of her as resting From the sorrows and the tears In a place of warmth and comfort Where there are no days and years Think how she must be wishing That we could know, today Now nothing but our sadness Can really pass away And think of her as living In the hearts of those she touched For nothing loved is ever lost And she is loved so very much.
