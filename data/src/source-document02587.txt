The experience of cancer is one that many of us will experience either first hand or second hand. There are many ways to help. The support available on-line is one way of helping our loved ones, friends and ourselves. It allows access to information and comforting words from the safety of home.

 I have been at a weekend affair to celebrate the Winter Solstice and feel much refreshed and ready to enjoy Christmas. I wish everyone who finds themselves here a happy Festive Season. I hope that nobody is alone who is not happy to be so. If you are alone really spoil yourself.

 New photographs are in . I am linking to another friends' gardens mesothelioma site. Lauren Hasha lost a friend to this disease many years after exposure.
I have added a new poem to . This is a poem in memory of Stuartie Brown, a regular at the Burns Tavern in Leslie, Fife. Stuartie died recently of an asbestos related cancer. He will be sorely missed for his cheerfulness and his voice. He sang a wonderful rendering of one of my favourites, Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon, by Robert Burns. I'm afraid I do not know the author of the tribute. Poems 5
I have added a link to where you will find podcasts by Cheryl Currier. The site is great and I did spend time listening to Cheryle. I was really pleased to note that like myself and others I know, Cheryle considers that  experiencing cancer not only changes your life but can change it for the better. Cheryle gives us her simple survival strategies under CancerSavvy - Episode 1, Simple Strategies. I reall recommend looking and listening and hope that you will pass comments as requested. CancerSavvy

I have added a link to another site. This site links to UK information which is helpful. This is obviously a big issue as world wide there is still an increase.  What a frightening fact that is when we all now know the dangers from asbestos. Thank you Remesh for giving this link. Mesothelioma
