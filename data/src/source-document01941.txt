The Blue Ridge has always been an integral part of Rappahannock County.  In the 1800’s, many families took advantage of its forests, minerals, and fine highland grazing pastures to carve out distinctive lifestyles that now form an extremely rich portion of the county’s heritage.   A combination of factors including depletion of natural resources, shifting economic trends, and the establishment of the Shenandoah National Park in the 1930’s brought an end to this traditional mountain life. Many of these folks were moved involuntarily to resettlement areas along the base of the Blue Ridge, but memories of the colorful past are treasured by their descendents. Larger farms and orchards have gradually been replaced by smaller operations including specialty livestock, organic produce, and vineyard/wineries, helping to preserve the county's rural heritage.
