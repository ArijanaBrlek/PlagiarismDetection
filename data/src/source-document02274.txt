House solves the inexplicable cases that other doctors cannot understand. House isn't alone in this quest. His team includes neurologist (), a neurologist with a troubled youth and a desire to avoid becoming as abrasive as House; immunologist () - who sometimes cares too much and has conflicting feelings about House; and Dr (), a specialist in intensive care who has lived a very privileged life. House's good (and possibly only) friend () is an oncology specialist, who has to help and stand up for House on a regular basis, while trying to get him to face a few harsh truths. House must also deal with his boss, () who, while often opposing House's unconventional methods, must admit that he is the best doctor on her staff. When a patients life hangs in the balance, House will do anything, including breaking the law, taking risks other doctors would not take, and sometimes even going as far as actually interacting with a patient. Houses methods may be controversial but his results speak for themselves. Inconsistencies with his team forced House to hire a new batch of doctors. This year House used and elimination process and the end resulted in hiring, (), (), and (). Although his old team no longer takes orders from House they're still around to throw in their professional knowledge when need is dire. Together they will continue to solve cases most doctors can't.Dr. Gregory House Hugh Laurie
