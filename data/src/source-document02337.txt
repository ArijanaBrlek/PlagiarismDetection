A Ton of Information on your Favorite dog, The Coonhound    
Coonhound Central's Game Page
e have started to collect some games that can be played online. They are not earth shattering great games, but they are fun to play. Some are written in Java, others Flash. You may need a Java or Flash plugin to play. Some only work on either Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer and not both. Sorry for any problems that this may cause.

e have listed the games below. You are welcome to play them, but if they crash your computer and reformat your drive, don't blame us. :)W
- A java script that causes an image of a raccoon to jump around your broswer screen. You try to click on it before it moves. Has a skill level that can be adjusted. Only works on IE. Catch the Raccoon
- I like this one. You basically use your mouse as a gun site and try to shoot the skeet before they go off your screen. Uses Flash. Shoot Skeet
- The old arcade standby that allows you to wack little rodents that pop out of the box. Uses Flash. Wackem
