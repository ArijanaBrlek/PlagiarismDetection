The College Board's SAT Readiness Program
The new SAT Reasoning TestÂ™ was administered for the first time on March 12, 2005. Changes to the test include the addition of third-year college preparatory math, more critical reading, and a new writing section. The College Board made these changes to better reflect what students study in high school.
This press area provides reporters and editors with accessible, accurate information on the test, the latest research findings, and expert contacts. The site can be used to develop story ideas that help your readers and listeners know more about what these changes mean to them.
