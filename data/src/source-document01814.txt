I think first started saying farewell like eight years ago or something. Then last year was the final season. Then year was the final season. And now to push the last episode back just a little bit more. Of course, the end result is that this season of is now 22 episodes which makes it the same length as any other normal season. It also gives them a little more time to come up with an excuse to renew the show for another year and make next season it's new final season. What else do you have going on NBC? They'd have to move it to 9:00 though because of Jay Leno, but it's not like the NBC lineup is brimming with hits they'll have to shuffle around. Of course, there is new programming to think about.

What was once a 12-episode deal for has now become an "almost" six-episode one, which is essentially nothing at all but a chance. Nevertheless, in the wake of NBC's essentially moving to a two hour per night programming schedule, any signs of hope for pending programs has to be something to grab onto.
