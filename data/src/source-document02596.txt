USB Multi Display Adapter for adding an additional monitor to your computer system (VGA, DVI or even HDMI), easily allowing multitasking of your running programs. This USB 2.0 display adapter enables you to connect one more monitor or LCD display to your computer, perfect for computer power users and gamers wanting to put secondary running programs to the side so they can keep an eye on them, but not be distracted from the primary screen. For desktop or laptop users, adding an extra monitor is now easier and cheaper than ever by using this unique USB multi-monitor display style connection, rather than the old fashion hassle of opening the computer chassis to install another video card. This is an easily installed device, so after a quick software installation, the second monitor comes alive. Even better, this computer accessory is ready to be used on both Widows and Mac OSX systems. This model allows both extended desktop and mirrored desktop modes, so you can either extend your monitor workspace to access more computer programs simultaneously (true multi-tasking) or add a mirrored display so you can see stock and news reports no matter where you look! Whether you are a graphics designer, day trader, home video lover, or professional blogger, getting a multi-display adapter to add-on an additional monitor to your computer is a great gift to yourself. This wonderful product is available for orders right now. As always, brought to you at a low wholesale price by the original direct from China no M.O.Q.
