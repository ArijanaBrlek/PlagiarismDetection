Believe it or not, there’s only a month left of the official summer holiday. It seems as though, as summer winds down and the call of the beach is less alluring, there are fewer and fewer activities available to keep both children and adults occupied. Just in the nick of time, however, the summer fairs begin rolling into town - aiming to please and entertain the masses!
American summer fairs are a tradition like no other. Found all over the country, in more counties than we can count, fairs feature amusement rides, games, competitions, and enough food to prove that your eyes really are bigger than your stomach.
Some travel from city to city, while others are hosted in the same place annually - always bringing the fun to you without the aggravation of a long car ride or the expensive admission fees normally associated with amusement parks. Summer fairs are an incredible destination for individuals and families alike! We’re proud to share some of our favorite upcoming fairs.
