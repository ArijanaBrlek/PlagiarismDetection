Web Design Project - Web Design Services,Â Manchester
Kudos Web Solutions employs a carefully structured design process to ensure that all of our projects meet the specification, and quotation budget as closely as possible. A review of the specification and quotation often leads to amendments being made which are then relayed back to you, the customer, to keep you informed of your costs. Usually, your new site will be produced by us using the following basic steps:
Design Specification
At the outset of each project, discussion takes place in order to obtain a clear understanding of what the client requires and to enable us to build up a design specification. This includes an initial quotation of the anticipated cost of the project.
Design
Once the specification is known, preliminary designs and graphical layouts are produced. A general layout for the site is then put together. The design of how other more technical areas (e.g. database design) of the web site is also devised here.
Implementation
Building and delivering the final solution, accommodating late additional requirements or implementing final changes including suggestions from the user acceptance testing.
Delivery
The fully developed solution is made live across the Internet. The final solution is tuned and tested to ensure that everything is functioning, as the client desires.
