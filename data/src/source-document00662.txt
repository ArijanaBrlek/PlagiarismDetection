Information For futher information about the Friends of Fort Griswold and the Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park call or write to:Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park Foundation, Inc. As local residents, we are conecerned for the future of Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. The need became apparent after funding to stabilize the earthworks at the park were denied. Funding for maintaining and perserving the Park has been declining. The Park needs an advocacy group to fight for its survival in these days of State fiscal constraints. It is felt that with the backing of local energy and a grass roots effort to raise money for the project, the State would be willing to help withthe preservation of this historic site. The battle that occured there on September 6, 1781 is an important part of our heritage and national history; the site and the event are richly woven into the fabric of the culture of southeastern Connecticut. Many decedents of those who fell in the battle live in our area. Meetings are held monthly on the third Monday of the month at 7:30 pm in the Monument House. The public is welcomed to attend.
