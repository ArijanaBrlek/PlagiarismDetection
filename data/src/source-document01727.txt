based reaction between (Deuterium) and Anti-matter (Anti-Deuterium) to go to faster-than-light speed. Anti-Matter has a negative charge but has the same mass and size as Matter, which has a positive charge. Anti-Matter Warp drive depends on a warp core Matter

The assimilates any species and technology that they find useful. They are not interested in species with little biological or technological knowledge. Borg are injected into the victim's body through injection tubes coming out from the drone's upper hand. The Nanoprobes uses the victims bloodstream and red blood cells to reach their targets within the body to rewrite the victims DNA. Borg implants and an are created on the individual and the assimilated individual looses the hair and grows dark veins all over their exposed skin. A is installed in the cerebral cortex to allow the assimilated humanoid to be included in the collective consciousness. Other that are installed, among others, are the regenerative force field generator, a subspace transponder and a neural link generator. Finally the drone will be given a specified task to carry out within a specified unimatrix. The assimilated individual has now lost all sense of identity and is under total control of the hive mind.Assimilation

Astral Eddy A tornado-like phenomenon which form at the interfold between space and subspace. The phenomenon sends out massive discharges of plasmatic energy. Tom Paris piloted a shuttle through astral eddies in episode Real Life.
 
near the Cardassian border which is considered very dangerous for space travel because of the areas many Plasma storms. Sensors and warp drive might not work properly in this part of space. Badlands Naturally occurring area in the Alpha Quadrant

Bat'leth A two metre long Klingon weapon with two handholds on the outside edge. The first bat'leth was, according to Klingon legend, created by Kahless when dropping a strand of his hair in a vulcano and later into the lake Lursor. He then formed it into a bathleth which he used to kill Molor, a Klingon tyrant. A typical bat'leth is 116 centimeters long and is composed of baakonite metal. The bat'leth is carried along the inside of the arm.

A collective of assimilated individuals (Borg ) from different species that are linked to each other in a massive collective called the hive mind.Borg, The
Drones
 
. The cortical node also allows drones to interface with an alcove and regenerate. There is no back-up system and a faulty cortical node will result in death for the drone If not replaced in time. The cortical node suppresses the humanoid immune system and prevents drones from rejecting Borg . If the cortical node is left inactive it quickly becomes useless. Borg Cortical Node The primary cortical node is installed through a circular interface in a port above the drone's right eye. It regulates all Borg cybernetic implants and is the most important part of the Borg drone implants
 
. The assimilated individual loses all sense of identity and is under total control of the hive mind. Borg drones are always shown in an upright position, even during the regeneration cycle, and walk in a robot like fashion due to limitations of its . They possess a superior physical strength and are almost invulnerable due to their ability to adapt to enemy weapons and to regenerate their borg drone shielding.

and neural processors (see below) inside and outside the body of a Borg drone. Borg Implants Cybernetic devices like limbs, eyes, organs, cortical nodes
 
Borg Neural Processor All drones are equipped with a neural processor that sends out a neuro-electric field that is capable of regenerating damaged componants on other borg drones. It can heal both organic and inorganic bodyparts. The drone dies if the implant is removed.
 
Borg Regeneration Each Borg drone is assigned an alcove in which the drone regenerates (refuels) its Borg system such as implants. Regeneration is the Borg equivalent to sleep and to achieve full power the drone must complete the full regeneration cycle.
 
Borg Queen The Borg Queen has maintained her individuality in a way that normal Borg drones can't. She spends most of her time in unimatrix 1 with her head and spinal column in her alcove. She seems to have a mostly synthetic body filled with cybernetic implants below her head and shoulders.
 
Bussard Collectors Bussard collectors are located at the front of the nacelles and carry the name of the 20th century Terran scientist who came up with the basic principles behind these collectors. They are used to collect particles, such as hydrogen atoms, that can be used as fuel.
