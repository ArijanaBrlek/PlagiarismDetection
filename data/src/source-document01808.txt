Anatomy Shows the Body Joints
`A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:"Everyone has been created with three hundred and sixty joints. Whoever mentions Allah's greatness (says Allahu Akbar), praises Allah, extols Allah, and seeks forgiveness from Allah and removes stones from the path of the people, enjoins what is good and forbids evil to the amount of those three hundred and sixty joints, he walks on that Day (of Judgment) having distanced himself from the Fire." [1]
Abu Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:"Man has three hundred and sixty joints. He has to give charity; one for each joint."The people said: "O Allah's Prophet! Who can afford this?" He (peace be upon him) said:"To bury the phlegm you find in the mosque or to remove things (stones) from the path of the people. If you can not afford so, it is sufficient to pray two rakhs [2] of Duha [3] ." [4]
