Spiritual to the 'Bone
The group has made tours of Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and England. In addition there have been appearances around North America sponsored by Universities, the International Trombone Association and The Salvation Army.
The group's four studio recordings have met with much popularity, including these reviews:
BILLBOARD MAGAZINE (12/93)
"The 'bone team tears through spirituals. . .with amazingly boppin' results."
LLOYD ULYATE (Hollywood Studio Trombone Artist)
"What a wonderful album! Great playing! Great arrangements! Great recording!"
DICK NASH (Hollywood Studio Trombone Artist)
"There is a bubbling spirit ('Let me at it!') and cohesiveness that is rare..."
GIL FALCO (Hollywood Studio Trombone Artist)
"We of 'Tutti's Trombones' take our hats off to you! How honored I am that you modeled your album after ours. There's a great similarity of approach and sound, and even arrangements."
DOUGLAS YEO (Bass Trombonist - Boston Symphony Orchestra)
"This recording is going to rip you out of your seat! It is one of the most creative, inspired trombone ensemble albums to be released in some time."
