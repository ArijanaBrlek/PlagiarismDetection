The shipping subsidiary of the giant national oil company PETROBRAS.  Nuesse's site shows the green as a gray-green, but I believe based on seeing Petrobras stations in Brazil that it is really the same as in the national flag. 16 June 2001
Joseph McMillan,
FRONAPE's flag is not correct anymore. It was changed since PETROBRAS changed its trademark (BR symbol) in 1994 and lately created its subsidiary for transportation in 1998, called TRANSPETRO.

Two related companies are Frota Amazônica S.A. and Frota Oceánica Brasileira.  Both fly flags divided vertically, with a large letter F mirroring itself in different colors.  That for Amazônica has a green and yellow field with the Fs in white and blue.  The Nuesse site shows the Amazônica flag with a muddy greenish-grayish-blue hoist half.  A check of the confirms that it should be green. 15 June 2001 company website

Frota Amazonica S.A. became Frota Oceica e Amazônica (FOASA) in1996 and incorporated the fleet previously shown under and show the fly "F" as green rather than blue which may indicate original colours. 22 December 2002 Frota Oceica Brasileira S.A. Brown's Flags and Funnels 1982 1995

Joseph McMillan,
Their fleet became absorbed into Frota Oceica e Amazônica in the 1990s. The flag in the picture above, by my calculations, is actually shown back to front even though that is the way both Brown and display it. The company website image of the flags clearly shows that the white is in the hoist and if you study Josef's flag, although the hoist area does not stand out, the width from the red "F" to the side is greater than that of the white "F" to the side indicating to me that the white includes the hoist area. 22 December 2002 1995 Josef Nuesse

I noticed the comment about the blue as the hoist [as opposed white in page]. Here is a picture of the logo I have on a piece of china. Does the order of the color help date the flag? , 12 November 2007 Josef Nuesse
