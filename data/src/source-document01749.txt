Welcome
The Alliance for Historic Hillsborough, fostering community parnerships that enhance Hillsborough's cultural and economic future while preserving our past.
Living in Hillsborough is not about isolating the past in a time capsule. It is about managing change; integrating the old and new in ways that improve the quality of life in our community; and maintaining the unique qualities that make Hillsborough such a great place to live, work and visit.
Through the years the seven organizations that make up the Alliance for Historic Hillsborough have worked to enhance a quality of life in Hillsborough that is defined by our vibrant neighborhoods, spectacular setting, lively downtown, and notable historic structures. With your support we have the opportunity to protect, re-use, and maintain the irreplacable historic legacy of past generations.
