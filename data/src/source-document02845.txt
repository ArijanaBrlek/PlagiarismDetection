The Food Stamp Program helps low-income South Dakotans buy the food they need to stay healthy while they work to regain financial independence. Food stamp benefits are provided to supplement the recipient’s food budget. The amount of benefits a household receives is based on its size, income and allowable expenses.
Food stamp recipients are given a plastic Dakota EBT Card. The store cashier runs the debit card through a point-of-sale device to subtract the recipient's purchase amount from their allotted benefits. Using the card is much faster and easier than paper coupons and eliminates loss or theft of food stamps.
The Food Stamp Program operates under the requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
