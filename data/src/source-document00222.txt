Current employment opportunities at The Becket Fund:
 
New Becket Fund Fellowship
The Becket Fund is now accepting applications from practicing attorneys for a Becket Fund Fellowship.  The Fellowship is a two year appointment supported by the Avi Chai Foundation. The Becket Fund Fellow will work initially from our DC offices, with a possible opportunity to work from New York City during the latter part of the Fellowship.  The focus of the Fellowship is to engage in litigation and scholarship regarding Blaine Amendments, originally anti-Catholic state constitutional amendments that are now discriminatorily applied to prevent religious institutions of all sorts from participating equally in public benefits.  Applicants should have experience in both litigation and scholarship, and a demonstrated commitment to the Becket Fund’s mission of protecting religious liberty for people of all faiths.
