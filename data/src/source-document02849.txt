Rainbow Bridge was established in 1989 as a living legacy to Bessie "Granny" Stephens. Inspired by the experiences of her grandmother in a nursing home, Bessie's granddaughter, Linda Holloway and co-founder, Sharron Brandrup, set out to create an organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for those living in nursing care.  Initially, Holloway and Brandrup took small groups of children to nursing home facilities to provide companionship for the seniors.

Moved by the interaction they observed, Holloway and Brandrup called upon their musical theatre talents and co-wrote . This heartfelt musical was performed at the Denver Center for Performing Arts and depicted the life of nursing home elders and the magic of bringing generations together. A call to action, the musical inspired many of the programs Rainbow Bridge offers today.Rainbow Bridge, An Intergenerational Musical
Established in 1994, as a Colorado based 501(c)(3), Rainbow Bridge is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life of elders living in nursing home and assisted living facilities through programs involving youth, families, business and community organizations.
Well over 13,000 young people have participated with Rainbow Bridge in the past or are currently visiting nursing home facilities through their schools, churches or other youth programs.
Rainbow Bridge is maintained and directed by co-founders Sharron Brandrup and Linda Holloway, a staff and a board of directors.
