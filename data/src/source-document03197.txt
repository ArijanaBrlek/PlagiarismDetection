Egypt and Mesopotamia Wine Regions in History
Egyptian Artifacts from 400bc
In the story of mankind, wine has a long and distinguished history. Traces of wine were first found in Sumeria, the lower regions of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia held the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and is often called the "cradle of civilization". Wine is mentioned as far back as 2750BC, but existence of wine goes further - now dated at 5400BC. Mead - wine made from honey - has been traced to the year 6,000 BC.
Sumeria as a nation existed from 2500BC - 1900BC. During this time, the people drank quite a bit of wine and beer. Often, the two were inbibed during the same meal or event. Sumerian wines were made from grapes and dates. In their culture, drunkeness was accepted - in their religious stories, even gods got drunk.
Wine is also early in history of the ancient First Dynasty of Egypt (3100bc - 2890bc). Remnants of grapes were found dating to this period. Soon, pictures of wine making operations were used to decorate walls and palaces. There were two stages to making wine back then - the crushing for the free run, followed by pressing. A fermentation stage occurred between these two. The wine then went into amphorae - large pottery vessels with spouts, used for bulk storage and transportation. Amphorae were stoppered with cloth, leather, cork or fired clay, then sealed with mortar.
A smaller hole let out the CO as it fermented within, and at some point this hole was also sealed. Amphorae sometimes had flat bottoms, but most of the time the bottom came to a sharp point, which was also used to help carry them. Final fermentation occurred in the amphorae.2
