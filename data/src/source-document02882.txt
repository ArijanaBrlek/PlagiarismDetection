Each section of this beautiful fence can be lifted out and put back in place anytime, making fence and yard maintenance a breeze. The pickets are nailed to 2 x 4 stringers that rest on "saddles" (notched blocks) mounted on the posts. Beaded moldings on the front faces of the pickets camouflage the stringers and overlap the saddles.Lift Away Pickets
