Dear Daisy Dog
Our neighbors Jack Russell terrorizes our community. He has bitten at least 10 people, including my child. In addition, he invades our yard and attacks our dog.
We like our neighbor, but we cant get the message across that her dog should not run loose. What can we do?
Daisy Responds
I wouldnt want to live with a biting dog, but if your neighbor chooses to, the least she can do is protect others from her canine terrorist.
If talking hasnt resolved the problem, photocopy this column and send it to her. Attach a petition signed by others in your neighborhood.
If that doesnt work, contact the authorities.
I live in Pennsylvania, and under our Dog Law, any dog that attacks a human without provocation  even once  can be declared a dangerous dog.
When this occurs, the owner must confine the dog and post a warning, complete with a symbol recognized by children. When the dog is off his property, he must be leashed and muzzled.
In addition, the dogs owner must pay a $200 registration fee and carry a $50,000 insurance policy.
Dogs that bite give all of us a bad name. For our sake  and to protect a child who might suffer permanent nerve damage or facial scars from the next bite  please get this dog off the streets.
