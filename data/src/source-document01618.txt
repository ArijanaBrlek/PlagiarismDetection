View Baseball Fields for all Parks
There are hundreds of ballfields in New York. Most fields are regulation size, but there are many smaller fields for Little League use. There are fields in all of the boroughs with grass, turf and concrete surfaces. Free baseball instruction is offered in the spring. Privately-run recreation leagues abound for different professional and community groups.
Organized leagues or special events need a permit to use an athletic field or court. For people under 18, the permit is free. For those 18 and over, a fee is required.How to Reserve an Athletic Field or Court
