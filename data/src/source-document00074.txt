New NH Vehicle Registrations Will Add Improved Technology
New Hampshire Motor Vehicle offices will soon begin issuing new motor vehicle registrations that include new technology to speed up processing, improve security and aid law enforcement and inspection stations.Concord, NH:
The new registrations carry data that can be scanned with a bar code reader into computers so it does not have to be copied manually. Plans call for readers to be added to police cruisers to speed up registration queries during motor vehicle stops.
"We needed to upgrade printers at DMV and municipal offices and included these new features as part of that project," said Virginia C. Beecher, Director of Motor Vehicles. "We are working with the State Police, inspection stations, the NH Auto Dealers Association and municipal officials to implement this new technology."
Beecher said the state is providing a total of 564 new printers for municipal offices that issue motor vehicle registrations and DMV offices around the state. The printers were purchased with a $344,500 federal grant secured through the University of New Hampshire.
As part of the project, all Municipal Agents in the state will be on-line by September. Currently, some Municipal Agents are not on-line. They mail in their paperwork to the DMV, where data must be entered by hand.
In addition to the bar code feature, the new registrations will use special paper and ink to make counterfeiting more difficult.
"This major project was developed in-house by DMV employees," said John J. Barthelmes, Commissioner of Safety. "We are proud of their efforts to save taxpayer money and of the customer service they provide."
New Hampshire has 1.4 million registered motor vehicles. The new registration process will be used for all passenger cars, motorcycles and trucks, including commercial vehicles. It will not be used for boat registrations.
