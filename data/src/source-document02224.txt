About Volvo
Meet Volvo
If you ever have been wondering why an offshore round-the-world sailing race is named after a brand that focuses on engine-powered means of transport and construction& well, heres our answer:
The race tells an inspiring story about dedicated individuals and teams who with passion, energy and endurance, climb the Mount Everest of sailing . The Volvo Ocean Race also is one of the very few truly global sports events - taking place on 4 different continents, involving multi-national, multi-cultural teams and support teams. In short, it perfectly mirrors the world we live in at Volvo every day.
At Volvo, we are in the businesses of transport  the transport of people, construction material and goods. Transport plays a crucial role in the development of a society and its economy. However, we also know that transport  and we with it  is part of a problem that is one of the major challenges of our times: Energy consumption and its effect on our planets climate. Ever since its inception in 1927, Volvo has been sensitive to its environment, conscious that if the industry is to be part of the problems, there is an obligation to be part of the solution.
Therefore, at Volvo, we have for decades now also been in the business of building cars and vehicles with greater energy efficiency and less environmental impact - whether on the factory floor, on the roads, the construction sites, the seas and the skies of the world, Volvos three core values  Quality, Safety and Environmental Care are all intertwined, and Volvo is dedicated to the quality of the air that we breathe, the safety of our surroundings, the protection of the environment. That is one of the reasons why we like sailing!
The Volvo brand is shared between Volvo Group and Volvo Cars  welcome to explore our worlds!
