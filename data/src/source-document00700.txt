When a claim occurs, you are required to pay the first portion of the cost to repair or replace the insured property. This fixed amount is the deductible you selected. The insurance company pays the remainder of the claim. Deductibles are used as a method to stretch your insurance dollars. The greater the deductible amount you agree to pay for each claim, the lower your insurance premium. This can sometimes add up to a significant savings. However, you must decide how much of any claim you are willing and able to pay for to determine your deductible. We'd be glad to help you re-assess the deductibles you've chosen to see if they match your current needs.A. Q. What is a deductible?

Receipts are helpful in establishing a value for a lost item, but the insurance companies don't require them.

We'd be happy to discuss this option and to help you put together a Home Inventory, which can save valuable time and effort in case of a loss.A. Q. Do I need to save all my receipts in the event of a claim?

The chance of a serious earthquake in Boston or Bridgewater is less than in Seattle or San Francisco that's for sure. But nonetheless, there is some risk.

Your basic homeowners insurance does not cover earthquake damage. In fact, your basic policy specifically excludes coverage for any damage caused by any type of earth movement or shifting. A simple phone call or e-mail is all you need do to add this coverage. We'll immediately add a special earthquake endorsement to your homeowner's policy.

Good question, this is a relatively unknown but critical coverage for homeowners. If you have damage to your house and it requires substantial reconstruction, your local building inspector will require the work to be done according to the latest building codes. For example, you may need to install a costly new wiring system. Insurance companies only pay for a dwelling to be rebuilt in its original condition. They will not pay for upgrades which can cost hundreds of dollars. The answer is Ordinance insurance. It is an inexpensive endorsement to your home insurance policy. We recommend it. Q.
