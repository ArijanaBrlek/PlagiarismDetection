Thank you for choosing ! At I offer appraisals for the Juneau, Douglas, Thane, and Auke Bay Alaska areas.  With 16 years of experience in the appraisal business, I can reduce your time, efforts and costs in managing the appraisal process.Angie Nolan at Appraise AlaskaAppraise Alaska
I have lived in Alaska for over 10 years and have a thorough knowledge of the Juneau market.  I have appraised in Southeast Alaska and I am aware of the questions that underwriters typically have for this market - is a view really worth that much? is it really in an avalanche area? and some of the many others.  I work with you and your client to do the best appraisal available!
By offering on-line appraisal ordering, coupled with automatic report status updates and electronic delivery of the final product, I am able to eliminate the run around and phone tag hassles associated with this process. And since this process saves me money as well, I can keep my rates competitive with the other appraisers in the Juneau area.
