Posted by HR | | Preparing for a job interview
Just as people go to school as preparation for a career, they also need to put effort into preparing for a job interview. Think about it for a moment. Why do people go to school? We all know that the primary reason is basic education for personal growth and development. This is still the top reason even these days. In these practical days however, going to school is more of a preparation for the future. A future that is envisioned to be better than their own is what parents want for their children. Getting a college degree and landing a stable job is what they dream of.
