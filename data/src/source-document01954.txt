The School Academic Misconduct Officers have three main tasks:
Supporting the CAMO as members of the College Academic Misconduct Panel (see below).
Providing feedback and advising the subject area of any development points from cases of plagiarism. For example, the CAMO may contact a School representative after a particular case has been investigated, if there are any learning points for the School or subject area that have come out of the investigation.
Providing advice on plagiarism issues to Course Organisers and Conveners of Boards of Examiners if requested.
CHSS Academic Misconduct Panel
Under the University regulations and procedures each College has an Academic Misconduct Panel. The role of the Panel is to support the CAMO. The Panel's membership is:
The CAMO
The School Academic Misconduct Officers
Where there is a case to be heard, the College Academic Misconduct Officer and an appropriate School representative on the Panel (selected on a rota basis) will interview the student. The School representative who interviews the student with the College Academic Misconduct Officer should not normally be the representative from the student's School. The CAMO may wish to invite a representative from the student's School to attend and give evidence, normally the School Academic Misconduct Officer or Convenor of Exam Board. The student has the opportunity to be accompanied by another member of the University community, for example a Students' Association advisor. A member of College Office secretarial or administrative staff will also attend, to take notes at any hearings held.
