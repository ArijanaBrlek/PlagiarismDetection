Ungourdly Art
Plates, prints, wooden decorative objects. Anything else I feel like painting.
Like most people, I get bored with my job. If I said I was thrilled with every stroke of the paintbrush I'd be lying. Most times that's true, but every once and awhile I feel the need to paint on something other than gourds. In my fantasy land-life, I'd own a little shop, scrounge around auctions and thrift shops and revitalize things. But for now, this will do.

Acrylic gouache. Each canvas is 6" square, and since no framing is necessary they can fit in tight spaces. SOLD
These paintings can be arranged vertically, horizontally, diagonally or in a sqaure, as shown

Humpback Whales pass by Puerto Rico on their annual migration. On our trip down, one whale surfaced less than 10 feet from our boat. Ken was jazzed, but all I could think of was my sister's warning: "Do you know a whale can sink a boat in 5 minutes!" Thanks! Each stretched canvas is 6" square and the edges have a textured, painted finish, making framing unnecessary..Keep them together or space them apart, they are ready to fill a small, empty space. Acrylic gouache
