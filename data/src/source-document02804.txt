Free Public Lectures
The USGS conducts a series of free lectures at their Menlo Park Campus at the USGS Menlo Park Science Center, Building 3, 2nd. floor Conference Room A. Their December 18th offering, "Gemstone Deposits of the United States," presented by USGS Gemstone Specialist Pete Modreski was nothing short of excellent. Local Bay area mineral collector and Benitoite nut Rick Kennedy brought along a spectacular collection of very rare faceted stones for dessert. Next month's program promises to be equally fascinating:

Exploring Mars
Geology, Climate Change and Prospects for Past Life
Data from a recent polar lander, two still active rovers and three spacecraft in orbit are changing our perceptions about how Mars evolved. What do these new data imply for the prospects of past and present life?

Looking Back at...
The Jade Clock
There are plenty of "jade clocks" to be found (just do a simple search on Google), virtually all made the conventional way - quartz or mechanical movements made with metallic parts - housed in or decorated with jade. To our knowledge, however, there is no other jade clock in existence than the masterpiece conceived and created by members of the San Francisco Gem & Mineral Society 50 years ago. It is fitting to reminisce about this exceptional legacy as the theme for our annual show in August, 2009 will be "," a stone that continues to hold a high level of fascination for a large number of club members, for its incredible toughness, durability, mystique and natural beauty.trulyJade
Our jade clock is a full sized grandfather clock with a 16-jewel jade movement and jade strike train. Every piece of the clock was carefully designed, mocked-up in wood and tested for fit before being cut, carved and polished in the actual jade. The clock's 16 jewels were crafted from Chatham emeralds. The clock is housed in a case made of American black walnut and clear Plexiglas to allow complete visibility of the movement and strike train, and topped with spherical jade finials. Countless thousands of hours and hundreds of pounds of valuable jade, much of it from rare California localities, were donated to the project in an unprecedented team effort over a five year period of time.
The clock was first displayed at the California Federation of Mineralogical Societies' show held in San Mateo in 1959, sans strike train which was subsequently completed in time for the SFGMS show of 1962. The entire project was documented in a series of articles by club members Helen Stiles Chenoweth and Ted Bhend in the Lapidary Journal, which were then woven into a 12-page brochure appropriately titled "The Jade Clock." It fully documents the entire process and credits the dedicated club members behind this remarkable achievement. A PDF file of the brochure can be downloaded by (This is a 3.3 MB file, it may take a few moments to display). clicking here.
Though uncertain at this time, there is some hopeful discussion underway about the possibility of dusting off the heavy jade clock and (very carefully) moving it into the Hall of Flowers for the 2009 show, to be featured with our other jade spectaculars - the jade table and the jade train, which includes a town and station... all made of jade!
Postscript:
Not too long after posting the above information about the Jade Clock we received an email from Mary Jacoby, the Great Granddaughter of one of the principal designer/builders of the clock, Henry Reinecke. Mary spoke of Henry's great stories and his well earned pride in the Jade Clock. She still has, and generously offered to send us a copy of a wonderful article by Judy Vaughn from the San Francisco Sunday Chronicle, Bonanza Section, dated October 11, 1964. You can download a PDF file of this article by . (This is a 3.5 MB file, it may take a few moments to display). We are grateful to Mary for her contribution and share her fond memory of her Great Grandfather! clicking here
