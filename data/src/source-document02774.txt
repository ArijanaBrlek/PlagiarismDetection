Register On-Line
It is REQUIRED that you complete an "On-Line" registration or contact Assistant Training Officer Peter Girling at least one week before the course starts if you plan to attend this course. Your advance registration is required so that we may be sure to have sufficient materials available for everyone in the class. The balance of the registration process will be completed at 18:30 (6:30 PM) on the first night of class.
The course will cover many of the significant aspects of the formation and behaviour of the weather around us. It is presented in a straight-forward form, eliminating much of the technical "jargon", and is designed as an introductory weather course for those who want a more practical approach. By recording a few simple observations every day and comparing them in class, each boater sees the application of the text and lecture material to the "real world".
Detailed Course Outline
The course will cover many of the significant asects of the formation and behaviour of the weather around us. Meteorology - or the scientific study of the principles of weather - can be somewhat technical. This course has been presented in a straightforward form which has eliminated much of the technical "jargon", while retaining the essence of the material.
You will discover that the subject of weather is both fascinating and satisfying. All it will need is your enthusiasm to observe and record the daily "goings-on" of the air in which we live and the water on which we boat. With practice, it will even become possible for you to make a short-term forecast. You will not always be right, but neither are professional forecasters, and you will have satisfaction - and fun - doing it!
