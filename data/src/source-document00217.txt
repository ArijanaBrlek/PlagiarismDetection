Communicating with Citizens
 
In the 21st century, government agencies are combining the telephone with electronic communications (such as email and the web) to service citizens. It’s easy to understand why. Self-service solutions:
Have the potential to make dramatic improvements in government efficiency and productivity.
Process transactions at less cost than those by more traditional means and provide quick access to useful information.
However, it’s important to realize that not all citizens have access to the web. Even web-savvy citizens opt for telephone-based self-service and FAX given the broader availability of the telephone. Without a comprehensive approach, implementing web-based services may aggravate attempts to lower costs.
