Every month the Viking Vision is published and delivered to VHS students. Staff writers work with one another throughout the production process in order to be able to create a paper that the student population will want to read. From brainstorming to layout, all stages of newspaper production are peer constructed and peer evaluated. "Journalism is a great chance to have your opinions published. I know we all work very hard on our articles and usually everyone's articles are published. We try to work for a professional paper and we try to keep the best quality of work circulating around the campus," comments Junior Staci Goldstein. Every day during sixth period, room 501 is bustling with activity as Journalism students exchange information on different topics and articles. "The computers are always full before the paper comes out - everybody's working hard, trying to make their articles sound like something they themselves would want to read," states Freshman Sunshine Glover. "It is a fun class and nothing beats the feeling of hearing from one of your peers that 'your article was great!'," Senior Chris Davis claims.
