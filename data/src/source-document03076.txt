Theme Show Guide
Can anyone tell me if the new Theme Show Guide that we got in our change over kits is included the New Consultants kit? or do new consultants have to purchase it on supply order? Just curious. My new recruit doesn't recall seeing it in her new stuff, and I wasn't sure if since we received it in our change over stuff, if it would be included for them or not?
