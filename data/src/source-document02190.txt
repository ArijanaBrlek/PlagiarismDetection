The splendor and the excesses of the 400 Families
Even after a hundred years, New York's 400 Families continue to captivate readers. This book brings to life this extraordinary era, from the people and their delicious scandals to their extravagant palaces and opulent balls--a time when Mrs. Astor held sway, the Vanderbilts rebuilt society, and New York was the most glamorous, most envied, and most condemned city in America.
