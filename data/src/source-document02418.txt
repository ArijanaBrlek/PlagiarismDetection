The Grape Index
The Greek Vitis Database divides wine grapes into three categories based on skin color rather than on use. We have kept that format intact. Therefore our three categories; , and correspond exactly to their categories; , and . I have created a space on each cultivar profile page for use (red, white or rosé) but have not edited that information for each cultivar as of September, 2001. It is important to note that the rose cultivars are 1) not necessarily blanc de gris varieties even though most of them are used to produce white wines and 2) Greece is one of the few wine regions in which grapes of this kind are sometimes vinified on their skins in the production of rosé wine. Drs. Roubelakis-Angelakis and Lefort will be updating their database as conclusions are drawn from their analysis. We will be updating our profiles as information from their research and from other sources become available. Eventually all synonyms resulting in duplicate entries will be signified by links. More than likely, we will create a format that groups known synonyms into family trees, thereby eliminating any confusion resulting from the simultaneous existence of synonyms with homographs. As our website grows, cross-referencing in the form of links between cultivars, regions and producers will be added and updated. Any relevant information or corrections are more than welcome.
