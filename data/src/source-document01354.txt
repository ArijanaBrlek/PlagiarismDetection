This is a feature that makes this product a true . Adjusting the ramp incline varies the focus on muscle groups and provides a great way to add variety to the routine. Few offer this feature, but it's one worth finding since that added variety can reduce boredom, enhance motivation, and keep you from reaching an exercise plateau. You're not likely to find this feature on an elliptical with an upper-body motion. If you do, be cautious as it may present safety concerns regarding balance during your workout.Adjustable incline. cross-trainer ellipticals
The elliptical motion provides the closest simulation to walking and running available without the impact. An important factor to look for here is the feel of the motion. Some machines have a "kick" in their motion where the heel comes up off of the platform. You don't want to feel any "kick" or "bounce" in your motion. Find a machine that provides a true elliptical movement pattern for both forward and backward directions.Elliptical motion.
This is a critical question to ask when trying an . Does the product feel smooth? You can only determine this by trying several types of units. Spend at least 20 minutes exercising on a unit.

Some machines have upper body levers to add an upper body workout element. If you are not strength training (see balanced fitness), having upper body movement can help accomplish some upper-body strengthening. Keep in mind that if you are testing an upper and lower body , make sure that both motions are comfortable and intuitive. You should not have to lean to complete the range of motion or otherwise compromise your position. Test different machines to find what is most comfortable for you.Dependent upper body motion. elliptical trainer
The ability to move in a forward or reverse motion adds variety and challenge to the workout. This also greatly reduces the risk of repetitive use injuries common with some elliptical buying guide and stair climber users. Most have this option. Note that an adjustable ramp, combined with forward and reverse motions further varies the movement, muscle involvement, and intensity of the workout in both directions.Forward and Reverse motions. ellipticals
Look (and listen) for a product that feels smooth and is quiet in operation. A truly well designed should be relatively silent at all intensity levels.Quiet operation. elliptical trainer

An elliptical is an electronic piece of equipment. A quality unit is a long-term investment that, with regular use, will require service at some point. Most quality units will offer a lifetime warranty on the frame. When it comes to other components, look for a warranty that provides for at least 1 year of labor and a minimum of 1-3 years coverage on parts. Ask your salesperson what components are covered. Be sure your warranty includes electronics and other key components. Equally as important, does the dealer from whom you are purchasing have their own service staff who are trained and authorized by the manufacturer to service your equipment?Warranty.
Programming and Motivation
The basics from a fitness point of view are: elapsed time, stride, and incline. Having a measure of calories burned can also be very motivating. Consider what additional information or features will help keep you motivated day after day. Some of the most useful added features include:
Measuring your heart rate (HR) is the surest indicator of progress and intensity. Everyone has a target heart rate range for which you should work within. Too high and you risk injury. Too low and you won't reach your goals. The best ellipticals will actually adjust your workout variables while measuring your heart rate to make sure that you stay within this range. There are two categories here: HR interactive vs. HR display. The ideal is HR interactive because the machine will make automatic adjustments for you to keep you at your desired HR. You simply punch in the desired HR and the machine will respond accordingly throughout the workout.HR interactivity.
One of the biggest reasons people quit a program is boredom. Having a product that provides a myriad of programs will help keep a program fresh and full of variety. The ability to customize a program for your specific needs is also a great feature. Look for some research behind the programs.Pre-set and custom programs.
The best products will "remember" your favorite workouts or allow you to create your own custom course. Look for the ability to create and store custom courses in order to duplicate them again.Custom Courses.
In the world of personal training we have found over the years that many clients are intimidated or simply frustrated with the amount of features and buttons on electronic equipment. It becomes another obstacle to regular exercise. The best products keep it simple. It should take no more than 2 to 3 steps to launch a program. Look for an elliptical that has a manual or "quick start" mode. These modes require only 1-2 pushes of a button and you go.Ease of Use.
The key to success in any exercise program is consistency over the long haul. If you find a product that can add variety and challenge to your routine, you are more likely to stay motivated and experience success in reaching your goals. Look for features like an adjustable ramp, forward and reverse motions, and adjustable resistance levels. Minor tweaks to one or more of these variables will keep your routine fresh and challenging.Variety.
