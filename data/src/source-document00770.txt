How do middle-age NFL players stay in great shape and keep playing beyond their time? It's the anaerobic exercise they perform during practice that does the trick. Anaerobic exercise—hard, fast, sprinting types of exercise—is shown by medical researchers to make the body produce significant amounts of the most powerful anti-aging, muscle-toning, body-fat-reducing substance known in science—growth hormone.LAKE MILLS, Wis. - January 7th, 2005
It's widely reported that several well-known entertainers take injections of growth hormone for its anti-aging, youth-rejuvenating properties. Because of its ability to improve performance, growth hormone has been banned for athletes. The good news for athletes is that medical research shows that anaerobic workouts can make the body increase this hormone by 530%. This keeps older NFL players strong, lean, and performing like their younger counterparts. Everyone, particularly those who are middle-aged, can benefit from this lesson.
Growth hormone injections are given to children with clinical stature growth problems to help them grow normally. These injections do not make adults grow taller, rather they help adults combat the “middle-age spread,” officially known as "somatopause" by biomedical researchers.
The middle-age somatopause is signified by energy decline, weight-gain (around the middle, and hips), loss of muscle, and wrinkled skin after the age of 30. There are two cures for somatopause: 1.) growth hormone injections (which have very serious side-effect risks), and 2.) high-intensity anaerobic exercise.
Anaerobic exercise should be a part of every fitness routine, but even young adults should take caution and have a slow, progressive build-up program. To avoid injury, be sure to get a physician’s approval and implement a fitness plan that will slowly and progressively add higher intensities to your fitness training.
Vision Fitness, a top fitness equipment company in North America, with the help of Phil Campbell, M.S., M.A., and author of “Ready, Set, Go! Synergy Fitness,” has added a SPRINT 8 anaerobic program to their new 200 and 600 Series fitness bikes and elliptical trainers. No other fitness equipment company offers an anaerobic program on their products. SPRINT 8 is a quick, effective, 20-minute program designed to simulate the results obtained from high-intensity exercise experienced by NFL players. This program offers 16 intensity levels to give everyone from beginners to elite athletes an effective workout.
