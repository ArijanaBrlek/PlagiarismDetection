Lubbers Farm
I took this photo on in the early spring. It won’t be too long before it starts warming up. This is a great place to go for locally grown food, plus, I the Lubbers’ are great to know. Lubbers Farm

If I still lived in Michigan, I would definitely support this farm…even though these Lubbers’ are not related to me as far as I know. This concept is fantastic, I’m vegetarian and I would do cow-share for sure. Very cool Annie. Do you have a cow yet?

This almost looks like a painting, Ann. You have to introduce me to this in the spring. Your photos are GREAT!
