The orginal Earthbuilders Encyclopedia (EECD) was published in 1989. It has been updated and expanded and the readers love it! From ADOBE to ZOQUETTE, there's over 300 pages.
This new Earthbuilders' Encyclopedia is on CD-ROM. It's bundled with a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader®. This slick program is the industry standard for presenting technical manuals and allows us to offer mucho más information! We've got color photos, new in-depth expanded
 
entries, along with those classic line drawings - all in an user-friendly format.
How does it work? It's easy - click your way through a clear hierarchical index, or pan and zoom through the pages. Jump around the Encyclopedia via convenient links and cross-references. If you need a hard copy, just print it out.
Plus, there's an access section so you can instantly email the best and brightest in the business. To inspire you even more, we've added a full-color gallery of the best adobe and rammed earth homes out there.
