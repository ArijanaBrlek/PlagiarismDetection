Take a look at your theme and your plan, and make a list of everything you need to buy. Think about the food and beverages you're going to serve, what you're going to serve it on, what games are going to be played, party favors, decorations, are you ready? A tip on food: set the food up at different spots around the room. Put the chips on one side of the room and beverages on another. This will encourage your guests to mingle.Week 3: Final Details

Designate a photographer to capture these bridal shower moments for the bride. Set out disposable cameras at the bridal shower for the guests to snap "action shots" and then develop the film for the bride-to-be. Take a photo of each guest with the bride-to-be as they leave, and include the photo with each thank you note. Designate a gift recorder to keep track of who brought what gift, so the bride-to-be will have an easier time writing thank you notes.Creating Memories
Now is the time to reap the rewards of all your efforts! Greet the guests with a smile and make sure the bride-to-be gets an opportunity to meet each guest. Have fun and enjoy!Day of Shower!
