The first energy tea was also introduced by XS Energy and now there are two in their line up. Both are non carbonated and contain green tea. [1]
The company's focal point is to bring flavors that consumers love without the carbs and sugar. They are available in a variety of flavors, including three that are caffeine-free. All of the XS Energy Drinks, except the caffeine-free flavors, have approximately 83 milligrams of caffeine. This is the equivalent to a one ounce shot of espresso. In contrast, a tall cup of Starbucks coffee contains approximately 225 mg of caffeine. XS drinks contain slightly more caffeine than market leader . However, an average soft drink, like Coke, will contain approximately 44 mg of caffeine.

In a 2003 survey by BevNet.com XS Citrus Blast was ranked the third most popular Diet Energy Drink ranked on consumer taste/appearance. The company's six-month forecast for sales was sold the first weekend with Quixtar. According to David Vanderveen, co-founder of the XS brand, XS Energy Drinks did over $51 million in retail sales in its first year with Quixtar (September 2002 - August 2003), which he stated made it the number 2 selling energy drink in North America. Sales for the second year were over $70 million, $90+ million the third year and over $120 million the fourth. By the end of the fourth year, 2006, XS was the fastest growing energy drink brand, with more than 5 million cases sold that year. This is all accomplished without advertising and promotion like other energy drinks. [8] [2] [9] [2]
