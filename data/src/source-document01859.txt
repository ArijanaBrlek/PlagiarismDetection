New Casino, Eastside Cannery, Opens with New Poker Room
A new 8-table poker room now exists on the Boulder Strip, in the East part of Las Vegas at the location of the razed Nevada Palace. is next door. It's a pretty nice casino, built for $250 million and owned by same firm that owns The in North Las Vegas and manages the Rampart Casino, adjacent to the on the west side. The new casino is the first to be opened on the East side in more than a decade. The Eastside Cannery Poker Room spreads the usual games. Sam's Town Cannery Suncoast
Hard Rock Opens "Poker Lounge"
The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino recently opened a new poker room with 18 tables. Dubbed the "Poker Lounge", it's a little different in that there is more noise, (rock music, etc) and has the feel of a nightclub, rather than a traditional poker room. All kinds of games are spread there, some at fairly high stakes, as the Hard Rock attempts to gain some of the big poker names. A full slate of tournaments, from a $65 buy-in 11 am tournament, to a $330 buy-in weekend 3 pm tourney, are offered. All the tournaments have 5,000 or more starting chips, including sit-n-goes, also offered there. The Hard Rock is located at Harmon & Paradise, on the East side. Paradise is the street that leads to the airport if taken southbound. Harmon is the one half way between Flamingo and Tropicana. The poker room is located near the main parking structure entrance. A short walk from there through some rock history areas surrounding a few shops and eateries, etc leads to the Poker Lounge.
Excalibur Re-Opens Poker Room with 12 Electronic Poker Tables
Excalibur Casino closed their poker room recently to take out the regular poker tables and install 12 new "PokerPro" tables, dealer-less tables with computer monitor screens for each of the 10 player seats and a big monitor in the middle of the table to display community cards and other necessities. A little like online poker, only with live people sitting around the table, the new poker tables save staffing costs for the poker room. The player deposits cash onto his MGM Mirage Players Card. Once the card is funded, the player needs to get on a waiting list for a cash game by swiping the card at a machine with a touch screen display in the middle of the room, then choosing which game he wants to get on a waiting list for. Once at a table, the player inserts his card into the slot and chooses the amount he wishes to play with during the session. Once he's dealt into a hand, the poker player cups his hands around the display of the face down cards and the touch-screen electronics displays his hole cards, hidden from view of the other players by the act of cupping of the hands. As soon as the player takes his hands away, the cards go face-down again. When the action gets around to the player, he has a choice of options at the top of his display, and once again touches the screen in the appropriate places to select his action, check, bet, call, raise, or fold. Each action is required to be confirmed before it is official. In the case of raising or betting an optional amount, the player hits the appropriate chip display with a finger or the corner of his player's card as many times as needed. As he is doing this, the amounts he is choosing is available for view by everyone, but he may retract and undo any time before hitting the "confirm button". This would be similar to a regular live game where the player is counting out chips behind the line before taking an action. Games spread on the first Friday night we were there, were .50/1.00 no limit hold'em, $2/$4 limit, $1/$2 no limit, and $2/$5 no limit. Omaha hi-lo was about to be played when we left. About 6 of the 12 tables were in use during that evening. If the new system catches on, look for other casinos to follow suit. A 10% rake was taken from each pot of the .50/1.00 NL game, capped at $3.00. Online poker is normally raked at 5%.
Caribbean Stud vs. Caribbean Holdm
Caribbean stud has been around for some time, from even before the 21st Century poker boom. When online casinos became popular, it was only natural that many would begin to feature . The Texas holdm craze has finally caught up with this popular table game, and now online Caribbean holdm is being offered. Which should you play?Casino Poker Variations
Online Poker Alive and Well
10/31/07
Despite scandals at Absolute Poker, whose owners or ex/owners were caught cheating in the very largest tournaments and the highest stakes cash games, online poker in general is doing very well, both in the U.S. where the game has been more or less banned for over a year, and everywhere else in the world as well. The sites that discontinued the U.S. market are mostly thriving without the biggest contingent of players and the ones that still allow players from the U.S. are going better than ever. Because of the , we don't recommend this site any more. Instead, our recommendations are the tried and true and the lesser-known, but dynamite site . At Bugsys, you can make a min deposit and then play all kinds of promotional tournaments to build your bankroll with little or no risk.

808 Remain as "Rainy" Day 3 Begins
Gus Hansen Among Chip Leaders
July 12, 2007 - Day 2B concluded last night with 459 remaining players as play was halted at the exact moment of the same level that the 349 remaining players from Day 2A's play was halted. Day 3 begins at noon today with all 808 remaining players playing at the same time and in the same room, with about 20 minutes left in level 11. The overall chip leader is Rain Khan with 580,000 in chips. Rain played last night. Day 1A was led by Jon Moonves (570,000), putting him in 2nd place overall. Since Day 1A's Jeff "Mr Rain" Bangart (551,000) is now in 3rd place overall, that makes 2 out of the first 3 chip leaders are associated with rain and hopefully will not be confused with each other during Day 3 or beyond. Whether either one rains on the parade of Gus Hansen (530,000), last night's 2nd in chips finisher, remains to be seen. Hansen is the only superstar close to the top and is in 4th place overall. Blind player Hal Lubarsky (328,000) is having a remarkable tournament. There was controversy as to whether or not he would be allowed to play since he needs an assistant to tell him everything that happens and poker is supposed to be a "one player per seat" game. Other well-knowns in good shape from Day 2B are Chip Jett (260,000), Carlos Mortensen (260,000), Ted Forrest (255,000), Darrell "Gigabet" Dicken (250,000) of online fame, and J.C. Tran (212,000). Others in not as good a shape but still kicking are Gavin Smith (150,000), 2002 champ Robert Varkonyi (150,000), Chris "Jesus" Ferguson (150,000), both daughter and son of legend Doyle Brunson, Pamela (125,000), and Todd (95,000), colorful Humberto Brenes (95,000), and many others. Busted yesterday were Daniel Negreanu, Chris Moneymaker, John "the razor" Phan, actor Jason Alexander, Allen Cunningham, and Phil Gordon, among hundreds of others. Both the "Rain" players represent .

Day 2A Survivors Include "Spiderman"
Closing in on Money Positions
July 11, 2007 - Former World Series of Poker No Limit Champion Huck Seed (280,000 chips) is poised to make a splash, along with accomplished professional Minh Ly (212,000 chips) in the 2007 World Series of Poker $10K buy-in Main Event, but spinning his web around unfortunate victims this year is movie star Tobey Maquire (150,000). Chip leaders are (570,000 in chips) and qualifier Â  (551,000). Scotty Nguyen has lost ground (74,000), but is still fighting as the field prepares itself to combine at the end of today's play. 350 players from day 2A remained when play was halted in the middle of a level last night to prevent an unfair situation when the money bubble approaches. Days 1C and 1D had far more players than 1A and 1B, which combined to make Day 2A. Therefore in order to ensure fairness when the entire field combines for Day 3 tomorrow, Day 2B will be halted in the middle of the same level tonight. Had the full 5 levels of play happened as scheduled last night and bustouts continued to happen at a fast pace, the Day 2A players would've had a money clinched situation at the expense of the larger field of Day 2B players. More notable players from Day 2A still in the hunt are Robert Mizrachi (159,000), brother of the famous grinder Michael, Billy Baxter (135,000), and David Levi (56,500). Busted from Day 2A are, among others, are after getting off to a roaring-good start, Tom McEvoy, James Van Alstyne, Joe Sebok, Jeff Madsen, , Lou Krieger, Evelyn Ng, Patrik Antonius, comedian Brad Garrett, and 2005 WSOP champ Joe Hachem. Day2B will see more well-known Day 1 survivors including 2002 & 2003 WSOP champs Robert Varkonyi and Chris Moneymaker, as well as superstars Chris "Jesus" Ferguson, the well-chipped Ted Forrest (150,500), who was extremely short-stacked early in Day 1, Daniel Negreanu (43,100), Gus Hansen, Carlos Mortensen, and last year's final tablists Allen Cunningham and Michael Binger.Jon Moonves PokerStars Jeff "Mr. Rain" BanghartDavid "The Dragon" PhamMiami John Cernuto

2007 World Series of Poker Main Event Draws Respectable Number
July 9, 2007 - As Day 1 of the WSOP main event draws to a close after 4 segments, A - D, the official number of entrants is 6,358 making the total prize pool almost 10,000 times that number ($59,784,954). 1st prize in 2007 will be $8,250,000. Jamie Gold won $12,000,000 for his 1st place finish last year, the largest prize ever for any sporting/gaming event. This year will be the 2nd greatest amount of prize money ever for 1st place as well as the total prize pool. Not bad considering the predictions of some that poker is on the way out now that the U.S. government has imposed its online ban to the game for many Americans. Some Day 1D participants still around at dinner break time are Daniel Negreanu, John "the razor" Phan, Gavin Smith, David Chiu, Freddy Deeb, Carlos Mortensen, Antonio "The Magician" Esfandiari, Dutch Boyd, and Layne Flack.

6,000 expected at 2007 WSOP Main Event
July 7, 2007 - Day 1B brought more players than Day 1A and the official estimate of the total has climbed to 6,000 with the newly created Day 1D. It is not too late to enter as of 7:00 PM on July 7. Entries are still being accepted for Days 1C and 1D as long as there is availability. The chip leader is from Paris, France, Tinten Olivier, with 270,500 in chips. Among some of the other Day 1A notables that survived are Billy Baxter, Barry Greenstein, Jeff Madsen, Minh Ly, Huck Seed, Brad Garrett, and Tobey McGuire. 445 survived the first heat of the 4-day Day 1's. Day 1B players still fighting as of the dinner break include Scotty Nguyen, one of the chip leaders, Roland De Wolfe, Joe Sebok, Dan Harrington, Tom McEvoy, Patrik Antonius, Joe Hachem and Kathy Liebert. The entire poker industry collectively held it's breath until the 6,000 player estimate came out, there were fears that the number would be so significantly smaller than last year's record 8,700+ because of U.S. legislation attempting to ban the online variation of the game with Americans that the game itself might die. Indeed, no direct satellite entries from online sites were accepted, but plenty of players just bought in anyway for the $10K and online sites found ways around the barriers in place to send players via online satellites. , , , , and were all choices for players from the U.S. as well as other poker players to win seats via the online satellite method for this year's .

World Series Main Event Begins
July 6, 2007 - The Main Event of the 2007 World Series of Poker with a $10,000 buy-in and a prize fund of perhaps hundreds of millions began at 12 noon today, one of three day 1's, as organizers prepare for as many as 9,000 players. Originally this year was to see a dramatic decrease in the number of participants due to legislation (see next article) prohibiting funding of online poker for U.S. players and the subsequent decision of Harrah's Entertainment, the owner of the tournament, to ban the alignment of online sites to the WSOP name at this year's tourney. So, in other words, no online satellites to the big dance this year. So why did we see so many online satellites to the big dance this year anyway? I guess the sites must have just given the winners $11K or $12K in cash and told them to go to Vegas and play in the tournament. We will know soon enough whether last year's record 8,700+ entries will be approached or broken.

Qualify for the WSOP
The World Series of Poker is not one of the most famous and popular live poker events for nothing. You don have to qualify through an intricate points and rankings system, heck you don even have to be a reasonable poker player to take part. Just pay the $10.000 and get to playin After all, people who gained access this way in the past, turned out not to be such huge underdogs after all. Joe Hachem entered the tournament like that and he ended up winning it. This doesn mean youl guarantee yourself a place ITM, though, it just comes to show how just about anyone can make it huge in the WSOP. Most people (like me) do not have $10,000 they want to spend on a poker tourney though. Fortunately, not only is the WSOP not reserved for the good and recognized players, but it not even a privilege only or the rich to participate. You can qualify for it via different satellites.

The noon and midnight tourneys at Fiesta Rancho were $25 buy-ins with a $10 rebuy for the midnight tournament. The 2 Fiesta casinos (Rancho and Henderson) and the Stations casinos share the same management group along with , also in Henderson. Apparently, a consolidation was in the best interests of the group. The trend we are noticing in Las Vegas poker right now is that some of the smaller rooms are eliminating tournaments or in this case, the entire poker room, while other more established rooms are increasing their tourney schedule and drawing more entries for their existing tournaments. Poker in Las Vegas is definitely thriving, despite the hit taken by U.S. online poker. Texas Station Santa Fe Station Green Valley Ranch

World Series of Poker 2007
Pre-registration begins
3/3/07 - Along with the announcement that the 2007 World Series of Poker pre-registration has begun, came a list of new Harrah's rules and clarifications of existing rules. Poker site endorsements must bear the .net suffix and the suffix must be no smaller than the site name. 3rd party entries will not be accepted if they're related to online poker sites that cater to U.S. players. This means of course that if you win a seat to the WSOP via , or any of the other U.S. friendly online sites that are offering seats, they'll have to find an alternate way of entering you, perhaps the only way will be to give you the cash and hope you use it to pay for your seat. It will be interesting to see how this develops. A couple other new logo-related rules have been instigated for the 2007 WSOP, which will again be held at the and begins with preliminary events June 1, 2007, while the $10,000 buy-in main event is scheduled for about a month later.

2/8/07 - Valentine's season brings a special kind of poker tournament at on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2007. A guy and a gal can team up together and play for some decent money for a $220 buy-in and have a lot of fun competing for good cash prizes. Blind structures and pay-out structures are very similar to their regular noon and 7 PM daily tourneys at this 2nd annual tournament. With 40-minute levels and slowly increasing blinds, the event promises each year to be a favorite on the circuit for both amateurs and poker professionals alike. Last year, 43 couples entered, alternating between ladies and men at each level change. This year, I think the alternation occurs in the middle of each level, either way it's a blast! Caesars Palace

Wynn, Venetian Schedule Special Events Simultaneously
2/4/07 - has entered the big poker tournament arena with the , scheduled to begin Feb. 21, 2007. Across Sands Ave. to the South, the is holding a series of smaller buy-in tourneys ($330 - $540) at the same time, perhaps anticipating a big spill-over crowd from the Wynn. While the Venetian series, dubbed the , is probably just a temporary replacement of their daily slighly lower buy-ins ($180 - $200 or so), the Wynn Classic appears to be aiming at competing with the likes of the World Poker Tour and by holding events with preliminary tourney buy-ins ranging from $500 - $3,000 while sponsoring a $10,000 buy-in main event to conclude the series. Satellites begin Feb. 21, 2007, preliminary events begin the following day and the $10,000 buy-in championship tournament begins Mar. 8 with the final table Mar. 11. So far, we are not aware of any online satellite opportunities. Venetian's series is called the Deep Stack Extravaganza because a starting stack of 6,000 and 10,000 in chips is offered, which promises to make skill more of a factor in the volatile game of Texas Hold'Em. Omaha 8 or better, H.O.S., and Pot Limit Omaha are given 1 day each during the series which features No-Limit Texas Hold'em on each of the other tournament days, the last of which will be Sunday, Mar. 11, 2007.

Riviera Tourneys Best Deal on the Strip
Wide Variations Found in Cost/Payout Ratios in Las Vegas
12/30/06 - Some poker tournaments in Las Vegas only pay back 69% or less of what they bring in, while others, like , give back a generous 85%. Located on the North end of the Las Vegas Strip directly across the street from , the Riviera poker room tourney schedule is 3 a day most days, at 10 am and 1 & 8 pm. Buy-ins, with the optional add-on, are $47. They have been drawing 2 - 4 tables full of players. Other good bargains on and off the strip that approach or exceed the 90% return rate are the , (more expensive), and the Circus Circus regularly scheduled single-table events (but not the 11:30 am daily ones which are a downright rip-off). Many other single table sit'n'go bargains are out there. One interesting small buy-in event that actually pays back 91% or so of what they take in, besides Riviera, and is still affordable for everyone, is , just East of the strip on Flamingo Blvd. Mainly a locals casino, the Tuscany Poker Room does give a large percentage of players buy-ins/tourney fees back to the players in the form of prizes, but beware the blind structure, which gets brutal not far into the tournament, favoring lucky players rather than skilled players.
