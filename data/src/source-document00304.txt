Fasciae of the Upper Limb - Arranged Alphabetically
Structure
Notes
bicipital aponeurosis
an extension of the tendon of the biceps brachii m. what blends with the antebrachial fascia on the medial side of the antecubital fossa
bicipital aponeurosis is an important structure to phlebotomists because it is superficial to the brachial artery and median nerve, but deep to the superficial veins of the upper limb - this provides some protection for the deeper structures during venipuncture
costocoracoid membrane
deep fascia extending from the clavicle to the superior border of the pectoralis minor m.
costocoracoid membrane is named for its medial (ribs) and lateral (coracoid process of the scapula) attachments; it is penetrated by three structures: cephalic v., thoracoacromial a. and lateral pectoral n.
extensor retinaculum
a thickening of the deep fascia on the dorsum of the wrist
extensor retinaculum is attached to the bones of the dorsum of the wrist in several locations, resulting in compartments which separate and anchor the extensor tendons; tendons are surrounded by synovial tendon sheathes where they pass deep to retinacula
fascia, antebrachial
deep fascia which forms a tubular investment of the forearm muscles
antebrachial fascia is attached to the radius via the lateral intermuscular septum; it is attached to the subcutaneous border of the ulna
fascia, axillary
deep fascia which forms the floor of the axilla inferiorly
axillary fascia is attached to the suspensory ligament of the axilla; it is continuous with the pectoral fascia
fascia, brachial
deep fascia which forms a tubular investment of the arm
brachial fascia is attached to the humerus via medial and lateral intermuscular septae
fascia, clavipectoral
a layer of deep fascia attaching to the clavicle superiorly and the axillary fascia inferiorly
clavipectoral fascia has several named subdivisions: it surrounds the subclavius m. and is thickened inferior to the muscle where it is called the costocoracoid ligament; clavipectoral fascia extends inferiorly to the from the costocoracoid membrane to the pectoralis minor m., a part which is called the costocoracoid membrane (pierced by cephalic v., lateral pectoral n., thoracoacromial a.); it encloses the pectoralis minor m. then continues inferolaterally to attach to the axillary fascia, a part which is called the suspensory ligament of the axilla
fascia, hypothenar
fascia covering the hypothenar muscle group
hypothenar fascia blends with the palmar aponeurosis and attaches to the fifth metacarpal bone; it defines the hypothenar compartment of the hand
fascia, thenar
fascia covering the thenar muscle group
thenar fascia blends with the palmar aponeurosis and attaches to the first metacarpal bone it defines the thenar compartment of the hand
flexor retinaculum
a thickening of the deep fascia on the ventral surface of the wrist
flexor retinaculum spans the ventral surfaces of the carpal bones (medially - scaphoid and trapezium; laterally - hamate and pisiform) to complete an osseofibrous tunnel for passage of the flexor tendons; tendons are surrounded by synovial tendon sheathes where they pass deep to retinacula
palmar aponeurosis
a thickening of the deep fascia covering the palm of the hand
palmar aponeurosis is composed of very dense connective tissue that extends out into each of the fingers
palmar carpal ligament
a thickening of the antebrachial fascia on the ventral surface of the wrist
palmar carpal ligament is a retinaculum that supports the tendons of the superficial flexor mm.; it is superficial and proximal to the flexor retinaculum of the wrist
