Challenges
Vinyl 2010 is a substantial commitment by the PVC industry and faces many practical, short term and long term challenges: 
PVC waste is becoming a progressively more valuable commodity.  Rising oil prices - and therefore prices for virgin PVC - as well as vigorous economic growth in the Far East are combining to make ‘end-of-life' PVC applications increasingly valuable for direct re-use.  We believe that certain PVC products - pipes for example - may be lasting even longer in service than we had expected.  This in turn means that less waste may be available for collection and recycling. A practical difficulty that will only be surmounted by sustained effort is to access PVC products, often sold long ago, at the time of their end-of-life, so that they can be made available for collection and recycling.  This often poses serious logistical challenges to Vinyl 2010 in pursuit of its recycling targets. Vinyl 2010 is about openness and dialogue with all interested parties.  Some stakeholders have been very critical of PVC, which they hold responsible for environmental and other problems.  We would like to work more closely with these parties, especially through our independent Monitoring Committee, to understand their fears and look together for solutions.A victim of success?
