Creating a myofascial release inside the joint capsule with pressure, movement and heat.
 
 
 
"Before I met Ken Youngberg I was unable to move my left arm. I was in constant pain and unable to sleep. I was diagnosed with frozen shoulders and scheduled for surgery in May. I had some movement in my right, so surgery was scheduled for the left shoulder only. I was referred to Ken by my chiropractor, and when I met him I knew instantly that he could help me. I started out seeing Ken twice a week, and after the second week I cancelled my surgery, and threw out my pain pills. Today I see Ken once a week, and I now have movement in my left arm. I am able to get my arm behind my back, which I couldn do before. I owe all this to Ken. Without his treatments, I would still be recovering from surgery, and going to physical therapy. Thank you Ken."
