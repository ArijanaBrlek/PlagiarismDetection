Bumping...
A few people have been asking why people are bumping threads. Here is an explanation that I hope can help newbies to get it. Bumping can be confusing. On the menu there is an option "new posts" that shows all the threads that have had activity since you last visited the site. Many people use that as their entire way of navigating the site, they don't go to the home page or even the main board pages but only click on "new posts". The new posts is a search engine for the site. It shows the most recent posts in descending order and frequently has pages and pages of new posts. By bumping a thread it will become one of the 1st threads someone would see when they click on "new posts". One way to see how this works is to click on "new posts" to see what is there. Then select a thread partway down the screen, click on it, comment on it, and then click on new posts and you'll see the thread is now in the top position. HTH (hope that helps)
