What is the main idea why history is past politics and politics present history?
Answer
The expression is simple when you think about it.
History is talking about wars and tragidies etc from the past, But it all goes back to decisions by the monarchy (King or Queen or Steward) or a goverment. Which therefore makes it Politics, from the past..Or Past Politics
And the politics and terror wars and other things our goverment are currently doing, in 60 years will be classed as history, So therefore politics is todays history or Present history.
