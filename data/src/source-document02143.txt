Satellite Internet Service vs Traditional ISPs
Have you heard about satellite Internet service? Perhaps you are wondering why anyone would want to have satellite Internet service. Well, let's look at the options. Most people using the Internet have one of three traditional options:
Using a standard modem - Modems haven't changed a lot since first introduced in PC's. With a built-in dial-up modem, customers attach the phone cable to the back of their PC, the phone line plugs into the modem. The modem uses the phone line to connect to Internet service providers. Dial-up modem speeds have increased, but have flattened out at 56K transfer rates - actually the data transfer is about 48,000 bits per second exchange.
Using phone DSL -- A DSL connection let's you use telephone service, without tying up your phone line. The transfer speed is much higher than the older modems, 1.5 Mbps vs. 56 Kbps. It's easy to use a DSL service, provided that you have a phone company that provides DSL service (it's not available everywhere). You do not have to have any rewiring done in your home, just plug the telephone adapter into your phone line and a DSL modem.
Using Cable Modems - Some people choose to have their Internet and television provided through the cable service. A single provides a cable signal to the consumer's television and Internet service. Unlike the phone service DSL, distance from the cable service providers is not a factor in integrity of signal. However, as more users are added to a cable signal, the quality and speed degrades. coax cable
Even though there are lots of modem options, satellite Internet service is ideal for people that are in one of the following situations:
Their telephone service provider does not provide DSL service and standard dial-up is to slow for their needs;
They live in a rural area that does not offer broadband access;
They have satellite TV service and are looking to consolidate services to limit billing.
In these cases Satellite Internet is a viable option for customers and will offer them fast, easy access to the Internet with fast download speeds.
