Flushing Mall 133-31 39th Avenue Flushing, NY
Flushing Mall was created by merging and repositioning two existing buildings in Downtown Flushing. A multicolor scheme was utilized throughout the space to create a vibrant and playful atmosphere, aiming to draw in a younger crowd.
The first building, eShops, is comprised of individual retail stores, with corridors providing a circular path of movement, taking visitors around the mall, breaking down the units into better proportions. An entrance ramp leads to an interior courtyard with skylights, creating a double-height atrium.
The second building, Flushing Marketplace, includes columns clad with bricks and beams laminated with aged wood, skylights and fountains. The Flushing Marketplace is home to various Asian-American clothing designers and importers, emerging technology companies, small exhibition and gallery space for local artists and businesses, and the first location of Caf JoJo.
The total floor area of Flushing Mall is 150,000 sq. ft.
