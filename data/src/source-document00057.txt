Scoring Guide
The essay will be scored by experienced and trained high school and college teachers. Each essay will be scored by two people who won't know each other's score. They won't know the student's identity or school either. Each reader will give the essay a score from 1 to 6 (6 is the highest score) based on the following scoring guide.
Please note that the essay images seen by readers for scoring purposes are clearer than the images we can display for students and institutions on our website.
