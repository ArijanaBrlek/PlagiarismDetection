 If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music he hears, however measured or far away.
~ Henry David Thoreau ~
The AQUARIAN ZONE is a rainbow window through which we may see the world in all its magnificent colours. Our angle is metaphysical, aiming to show both the literal and the symbolic connections between the mystical realms and the mundane.
The Universe is holistic. Our work focuses on attuning ourselves to the Music of the Spheres, our inherent wholeness, through which we can naturally gravitate to our place, the only one that truly resonates with us.

  We sincerely hope that your travels through the AQUARIAN ZONE will always illuminate, educate and excite you. The more sense it all makes, the more empowered we become to manifest our greatest potential.
