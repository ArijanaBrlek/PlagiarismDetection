The hibernation phenomenon captures biological as well as clinicalinterests to understand how organs adapt. Here we studied howhibernating grizzly bears ( tolerateextremely low heart rates without developing cardiac chamberdilation. We evaluated cardiac filling function in unanesthetizedgrizzly bears by echocardiography during the active and hibernatingperiod. Because both collagen and titin are involved in alteringdiastolic function, we investigated both in the myocardium ofactive and hibernating grizzly bears. Heart rates were reducedfrom 84 beats/min in active bears to 19 beats/min in hibernatingbears. Diastolic volume, stroke volume, and left ventricularejection fraction were not different. However, left ventricularmuscle mass was significantly lower (300 ± 12 comparedwith 402 ± 14 g; = 0.003) in the hibernating bears,and as a result the diastolic volume-to-left ventricular musclemass ratio was significantly greater. Early ventricular fillingdeceleration times (106.4 ± 14 compared with 143.2 ±20 ms; = 0.002) were shorter during hibernation, suggestingincreased ventricular stiffness. Restrictive pulmonary venousflow patterns supported this conclusion. Collagen type I andIII comparisons did not reveal differences between the two groupsof bears. In contrast, the expression of titin was altered bya significant upregulation of the stiffer N2B isoform at theexpense of the more compliant N2BA isoform. The mean ratio ofN2BA to N2B titin was 0.73 ± 0.07 in the active bearsand decreased to 0.42 ± 0.03 ( = 0.006) in the hibernatingbears. The upregulation of stiff N2B cardiac titin is a likelyexplanation for the increased ventricular stiffness that wasrevealed by echocardiography, and we propose that it plays arole in preventing chamber dilation in hibernating grizzly bears.Thus our work identified changes in the alternative splicingof cardiac titin as a major adaptive response in hibernatinggrizzly bears.Ursus arctos horribilis)PPP
