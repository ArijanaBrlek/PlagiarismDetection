Even mirrors can be a source of innovation, and the Titan wakeboard tower-mounted mirror proves it. Our exclusive articulating mount design allows for the ultimate in flexibility when installing your mirror. It doesn't matter which tower you have, our mirror will be perfectly positioned in front of the driver for the optimal view of the wakeboarder.
A mirror is an essential part of the safety equipment on any boat. As functional as most windshield-mounted mirrors are, Titan figured there had to be a better design that offered improved safety and convenience. Our tower-mounted mirror does just that by positioning the mirror directly in front of the driver for the perfect view behind the boat. And thanks to another Titan innovation, our unique articulating mount system, the mirror can be installed perfectly level and at just the right position, regardless of the towers design.Get The Best Seat In The House
Additionally, moving the mirror from the windshield to the tower eliminates any forward blind spot, and you can run with the walk-through section of the windshield open on scorching summer days without losing the view of your rider.
Enhanced usability and a dramatic improvement in safety make the Titan tower-mounted mirror one of our must functional and popular options.
