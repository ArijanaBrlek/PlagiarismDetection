For the modern bride that wants to have a Florida beach wedding, Miami Beach is definitely the best Miami wedding location and hottest spot around.

If a couple decides to have a wedding in Miami Beach, they will have the opportunity to experience over 7 miles of beaches, 3 golf courses, 20 parks, unbelievable art and culture, exquisite dining, dazzling night life, and world-class shopping. Miami Beach has always been a tourist-friendly vacation hot spot, but is so much more than that now, due to an economic boom resulting from the refurbishing of the Art Deco Historic District.

For their honeymoon, the available suites are spectacular.
