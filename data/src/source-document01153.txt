Kratos returns
Date: 05 01 2007
Get ready to rewrite history all over again as God of War II returns to PlayStation 2.
The original God of War and its snarling, merciless anti-hero Kratos redefined the action genre when it first arrived on PlayStation 2 in 2005. Featuring slick, brutal combat, an evocative setting based on the legends of Greek mythology and some of the most spectacular set pieces ever realised in a videogame, it did everything an action game should. Alongside a cupboard full of awards, SCEA's Santa Monica studio captured thousands of players' hearts with its bloodthirsty tale, and it's a tale that's set to continue this spring when God of War II arrives, exclusively on PlayStation 2. A sneak peek at a new demo of God of War II reveals that the key ingredients of the first game are set to return in abundance. Demoted from the god status he gained at the end of the first game - due to what can only be described as an extremely bad attitude - Kratos finds himself in Rhodes, with the entire city overrun by a pitched battle. To make matters worse, the Colossus of Rhodes - a simply enormous statue - has been brought to life and is hell-bent on ending Kratos' existence. As a welcome return to the God of War formula, it's magnificent. The Colossus is present in the background as you try and fight off hordes of enemies, occasionally causing trouble as his gigantic fists smash through the building you're trying to get through, before finally confronting Kratos directly in a barnstorming, protracted opener that's every bit as impressive as the encounter with the Hydra in the original game. God of War has always been about playing a part in something truly epic, and there's plenty more grandeur on offer in God of War II. Keep an eye on playstation.com over the coming months for more coverage of what's set to be one of the best games of 2007.
