Reimbursement Approvals for FerriScan
September 04, 2008 Â 
The Whittington Hospital in London, UK, has successfully gained reimbursement from the NHS for FerriScan, enabling clinicians to utilise FerriScan in the routine clinical care of patients with iron overload. There are over 15,000 people suffering from sickle cell disease, thalassaemia major or myelodysplastic syndromes in the UK many of which suffer from iron overload as a result of regular blood transfusions.
said Dr Farrukh Shah, Consultant Haematologist at the Whittington Hospital."Having ready access to FerriScan at the Whittington Hospital will greatly improve the efficiency of monitoring the body iron burden in our iron overloaded patients in a cost effective manner and will enable us to minimise the use of liver biopsy"
Additionally, FerriScan is fully reimbursed in New Zealand by the District Health Boards and most private insurers. In New Zealand, 1 in 7 people of European descent are carriers and 1 in 200 people have haemochromatosis, a condition in which the body takes in and stores too much iron from the diet.
These patients will now have access to a cost effective, non-invasive and accurate measurement of their liver iron loading enabling clinicians to optimise the management of their treatment.
