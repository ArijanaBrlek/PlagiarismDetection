Welcome to the Child Support Division of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney! We believe that has the right to the care and support of both parents, whether or not the parents are married or both in the home. Our purpose is to use the full force of the law to protect, preserve, and enforce this right.every child
Our primary functions are to assist in:
(1) Establishment of a court order for the payment of child support,
(2) Enforcement of existing court orders for the payment of child support,
(3) Establishment of paternity for children whose parents are not married, and
(4) Locating absent parents whose where abouts are unknown.
Despite having a limited staff and more than 7,500 open child support cases in Clark County, the Child Support Division has been very successful in enforcing and collecting child support. In 1993 the Child Support Division was awarded the first ever Director's Award as the outstanding child support office in the state. Over the past five years, our collections have more than doubled! In 2004 we collected over $4 million for the children of Clark County.
The willful failure by absent parents to support their children is an ongoing problem for millions of children in our country. As parents and as public servants, we must do our part to strengthen the family and to insure that our children receive the necessary care to allow them to flourish to their greatest potential. We must give top priority to the needs of our children in order to foster their growth and development. Families are the foundation of our society. We can no longer afford to turn our heads at the expense of our children and families.
