Motorola Fuel Cell Phones on the horizon
Finally, a replacement to the humble cellphone battery - a fuel-cell phone battery! Fuel cells have been talked about for some time as a possible replacement to battery technology, which is becoming increasingly overlaoded by all the new features thatgo into a modern cellular phone. Fuel cells can offer more power for longer, ensuring that you can still make phone calls even after listening to your tunes for several hours. Now, they've come a step closer to being introduced into a cell phone, with the news that Motorola has made a strategic investment in Tekion, a micro fuel cell developer.
 
"Our decision to invest in Tekion was motivated by its cutting-edge technology and experienced leadership in micro fuel cell development," said Warren Holtsberg, corporate vice president, equity investments and director of Motorola Ventures. "As mobile products have simultaneously miniaturized and increased in functionality, battery capacity has become a significant challenge. Tekion's non-flammable Formira fuel cell technology combined with an advanced battery technology, such as lithium ion, is a practical and efficient solution. Tekion's technology will help advance Motorola's vision of bringing seamless mobility to wireless users."
 
With Motorola's torpid speed in developing new products, though, expect them to have a fuel cell phone by 2015. Other cell phone manufacturers should have their fuel-cell driven cell phones substantially sooner.
