To think it all started with a phone call from outside a Kmart, confirming a story that John Elway had just blown off the president to play golf. That was more than 10 1/2 years ago, and I wasn’t even officially on the beat.
Yet that’s how my career began at the Rocky Mountain News.
As strange as it seems writing this column now about what the Rocky has meant to me, it’s also provided a sense of peace as I look back over the memorable and not so memorable moments.
For starters, let’s just say that I have learned a lot: First, There is No Running at the Masters. Second, my shorthand will never keep up with Shannon Sharpe’s mouth. And third, even Masterminds get fired.
I also discovered that it is possible to write 35 stories on Terrell Davis in one season, and three alone on John Elway after his Super Bowl MVP performance.
Yet as much as I lived and breathed Broncos for six seasons, my memories go far beyond the blue-and-orange.
Wasn’t it just yesterday I was sitting on a bench in Charlotte, N.C., listening to former Pro Bowl linebacker Sam Mills talk about the cancer he was fighting, and getting the courage to ask him if he was scared. I cried six months later when I learned of his death, at age 45.
Wasn’t it just last month when Coloradans Nate Oderberg and Cyndi Bixler opened up about the athlete/sons they loved and lost to suicide. It may have been the toughest feature I ever wrote, but I’ll never forget them or the opportunity this job gave me not only to tell their story, but to tell it in such a way that it might help somebody else.
Sure, there were Xs and Os and fades and slices, but the people are what made the job rewarding. It was amazing to watch Michael Campbell, or as he called himself, “little me from New Zealand,” stealing the headlines at the 2005 U.S. Open, and Iowan Zach Johnson cutting down the world’s No. 1 en route to his own field of dreams at the 2007 Masters.
On the local front, somehow I survived a raging blizzard to meet Joy Nameth, an outgoing teen who lived out of tents, trucks and back rooms but taught herself to read and eventually found her way home, first to tiny Walden and her father and then onto the Naval Academy.
Sure, there were plenty of assignments I questioned at first. But in the end they were worth the time spent in the freezing cold or searing heat. I was able to see how a simple game of pond hockey could turn grown men into kids again, and witness the pure joy a pretty-in-pink golf prodigy found chasing after a little white ball.
Of course, I’ve done my best to forget the hundreds of calls that weren’t returned from agents and big-timing pro athletes; but I’m grateful for the ones that did come - even if they came when I least expected. It didn’t matter that I was in the shower in 1998 when the late Johnny Unitas called back. He never knew that I conducted the entire interview dripping wet, knowing full well second chances don’t always come.
While we at the Rocky ponder what might be next in life, here’s a look back at a few who made this the best job I ever had.
The Southern Gentleman.
Dan Reeves didn’t really know me but somehow I had talked my way via phone into meeting him up at the lake home he and his wife Pam were building. Still, the best-laid plans seemed to be falling apart when our freelance photographer and I both got lost. Driving in separate cars, and using cell phones that had no bars, we navigated the back roads of rural Georgia. And when he arrived first, I begged him to keep Reeves long enough for me to get there. Little did I realize Reeves not only would wait but would offer a full tour, and a ride in his boat on that beautiful autumn day.
I can still see the sun lighting up his face and the breeze tossing his hair. He told jokes and reminisced, but the best line of the day came from Pam, a petite spitfire and a major strength behind this football legend. She was the one who had to make sure the construction was moving along, right down to picking out the fireplace mantel. And she would relay a story from the sales clerk about how they got that railroad tie to look old by tying the beams to a truck, then “hauling ass.”
So which beams did Pam want? “I want them ‘haul ass’ beams,” she said without missing a beat.
To this point, it had remained the best line that I had never been able to get in the paper.
Tiger Tales
It’s true. He really did take my tee time at Torrey Pines when he sank that memorable putt on No. 18 to force a Monday playoff at the 2008 U.S. Open.
But I’m not complaining. Playing 18 with fellow writers never would have compared to walking 19 alongside golf’s greatest in the most memorable Open in history. I can still remember Rocco Mediate high-fiving folks as he was carted back for the awards ceremony, and simply flashing a big thumbs-up when the sound system failed.
Peas and carrots
No, I never counted what John Elway ate, but that’s not to say I wasn’t sent anywhere and everywhere as the sporting world awaited his decision on whether to return or retire following the 1998 season.
Never mind that I had blown out my knee skiing with a co-worker on Christmas Eve. I was still headed to the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, crutches and all, with a recruited friend driving my car and carrying my briefcase.
It all went pretty good until we met some folks at dinner who convinced us to go to the Polo Room at the Beverly Hills Hilton afterward. While the pre-Grammy crowd walked the red carpet, we arrived in our own style — rented green Toyota Tercel, seriously underdressed, with crutches hanging out the window. Still, the champagne never tasted so good.
Grandpa Jack
No question he loved football, loved his son and loved life. And when I dictated my Super Bowl ring ceremony story from the back of the Golden Bee at the Broadmoor and saw him in the piano bar, I couldn’t resist requesting song No 7 — Bad, Bay Leroy Brown — from the play list and dedicating it to Jack Elway. Soon he and his wife were dancing. He is gone now, but there’s no forgetting his zest for life.
Those are some of the people I’ll never forget. Here are some of the sounds:
Alfred Williams’ laugh at those late-night dart-throwing sessions at The smiling Moose during training camp in Greeley.
The roar through my phone when the Rocky learned it had one not one, but two Pulitzer prizes in 2006 for the series Final Salute.
The sounds of Sweet Caroline sung by Red Sox fans close enough to touch from the auxiliary press box in right field at Fenway Park.
My heart skipping a beat during an Oh, No! hold-the-presses Dewey beats Truman panic-attack after filing a story on Todd Helton finally making it to the World Series only to have to write a new one in minutes just in case after the Diamondbacks started a comeback in Game 4 of the NLCS.
The sound of an ice-cold Toohey’s New cracked open after the American Bowl in Sydney - a truce from a rival columnist pulled from his suit pocket as we waited for the next bus out of the stadium. If only the newspaper war could have been so easy.
It’s hard to believe I’ve been at this for 25 years, along the way witnessing the execution of a murderer, Tiger’s famous hole-in-one at the beer fest known then as the Phoenix Open, and the beauty that is Augusta National at dawn.
Through it all, I’ve always tried to paint a picture for those who couldn’t go where I went. I’ll still do that, in some form. Change is just part of life.
Just like that Kmart on Arapahoe road. It’s gone now and so undoubtedly is that pay phone.
