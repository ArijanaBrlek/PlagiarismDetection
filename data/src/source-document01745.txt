He'd also formed a blueprint for the prospective league's operations, which included early television exposure, heavy promotion in home markets, and owners willing to absorb years of losses--which he felt would be inevitable until the league found its feet. He also assembled a list of prospective franchises located in markets attractive to a potential television partner. World Football League Frank Magid Associates
With respected college and NFL coach as the first employee, Dixon signed up 12 cities--nine where there was already an NFL team and three where there wasn't one. They quickly reached an over-the-air television deal with and a cable deal with then-fledgling . The deals would yield roughly $13M in 1983 and $16M in 1984; $9M per year from ABC.

Once play actually started, the league experienced the same kind of franchise instability, relocation, and closure that most leagues that have competed with the NFL have seen. It certainly can be argued that most teams going over budget starting in the first year and having overly optimistic attendance and viewership projections sped up franchise churn.

The team was injury prone and mistake prone, on and off the field. Prior to the 1983 season, the team traded away the rights to the league's leading sacker, linebacker to Michigan for a 5th round pick. In spite of a rotating door at QB, the Federals lost 8 games by a TD or less, a fact that gave team owner hope for the 1984 season.

Blanding fired very popular former Broncos Coach after a 4-7 start, but was still able to finish the season with strong attendance.

After seeing the Wranglers lose 10 in a row to finish with 4-14 (tied with Washington for the league's worst record) and perhaps more importantly seeing attendance wilt in summer heat at , Joseph decided to sell the Wranglers. Meanwhile, in spite of having the league's highest profile coach, (), and being at worst the third best team in the league, the had drawn an anemic 18,133 per game. Blitz owner Dr. , a Phoenix resident, felt the losses didn't justify an investment so far from his home in Phoenix. Dietrich sold the Blitz to Milwaukee heart surgeon James Hoffman, and then bought the Wranglers from Joseph. Almost immediately after Diethrich closed on his purchase of the Wranglers, he and Hoffman swapped their team assets--coaching staff, most of the players, and all. To Blitz fans, it seemed that Hoffman had jettisoned one of the league's elite teams in favor of a team that tied for the league's worst record. In truth it was worse than that. In a league starved for competent QB play, Wrangler triggerman Alan Risher stayed in Arizona. The new Blitz would feature inaccurate, longtime Bear backup QB (signed in November of 1983 to a 4 year $5 million deal). In January, The Blitz tendered an offer that would have been the largest contract in football --- $2 Million dollars a year for 3 years --- to Bears running back .

Trump poached several NFL starters, including Cleveland's QB . Oldenburg's Express went after a number of highly regarded collegiate players. This combined with a general lack of quality QBs (only 9 QB's in the 12 team league finished the 1983 season with QB ratings above 70) and HBs (even in an 18 game season only 6 rushers broke the 1000 yard mark) tipped off another explosion in league spending as USFL teams raided the NFL and college ranks to keep up.

The ' signings of high profile collegiate players culminated with the signing of BYU QB to a $40 million guaranteed contract--at the time, far and away the largest contract in pro football history.

Some franchises folded before or after a season's play, and others moved and/or merged. However, unlike the and other leagues that have competed against the NFL, no USFL team actually folded a season's play. This was because, with the notable exception of San Antonio, all of the league's teams were fairly well capitalized from the start, as Dixon had anticipated the league would have to absorb years of red ink before coming into its own. By comparison, most of the WFL's teams appeared to be severely undercapitalized. Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Antonio did come close to folding in midseason, but league intervention helped these teams make it through the season. WFL during

[] edit The Dixon Plan vs. building a league of stars
At first the USFL competed with the older, more established by following the Dixon plan and trying not to compete directly with it, primarily by playing its games on a March-June schedule but also having slightly different rules, most notably: National Football League
The (since adopted by the NFL, in ). two-point conversion 1994

A territorial draft, in hopes of stocking teams with local stars to help the gate. (Similar to the proposed ) All-American Football League
Although the Dixon plan called for a $1.8 million salary cap in anticipation of slow growth, several teams exceeded it in the pursuit of stars.
Ironically, the league's biggest splash the signing of Walker has been considered in hindsight to have foreshadowed the league's demise. Like the NFL, the USFL barred underclassmen from signing. However, league officials were certain that this rule would never stand up in court, so they allowed Walker to sign with the . More importantly, Walker signed a three-year contract valued at $4.2 million with a $1 million signing bonus. Due to the USFL's salary cap rules, this was a personal-services contract with Generals owner J. Walter Duncan, and not a standard player contract. Nonetheless, the other owners didn't raise any objections, knowing how important Walker was to the league. New Jersey Generals
In fact, much of the league's credibility with fans as being a serious challenger to the establishment NFL arose from its willingness to sign a few marquee talent such as high profile college stars like Walker, , and as well as some familiar NFL vets like and members of the NFL vet laden , like . The league also made a serious run at some other stars, such as . No one can dispute that in particular, the signing of Walker and several other winners gave the league much-needed credibility, but the Dixon plan did not call for as much spending on talent as the league did in 1983. Craig James Anthony Carter Kelvin Bryant Chuck Fusina Chicago Blitz Greg Landry Eric Dickerson Heisman Trophy
This desire to win and be seen as NFL caliber eventually led to almost all of the teams jettisoning Dixon's plan, with many of them spending large amounts of money to put competitive teams on the field. For instance, the Michigan Panthers reportedly lost $6 million three times what Dixon suggested a team could afford to lose in the first season even as they became the league's first champions.
Dixon urged the members of the league to reduce spending. Rather than backing off spending and dispersing some of the larger contracts to alleviate the problem, the league sought other options to take on revenue to cover increased costs, magnifying the problem. The league added six more teams in 1984 rather than the four initially envisioned by Dixon, to pocket two more expansion fees. The league was so desperate for capital that it accepted an application from San Antonio, despite a study that advised in no uncertain terms that San Antonio could not support a USFL team. A frustrated Dixon sold his stake and got out.

[] edit Spring schedule vs. Fall schedule
In 1984, the league began discussing the possibility of competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The idea was to force a merger in which the NFL would be forced to admit some USFL teams. Despite the protests of many of the league's "old guard," who wanted to stay with the original plan of playing football in the spring months, the voices of Chicago owner and Generals owner and others would eventually prevail. Trump sold a majority of the other owners on the gamble that if a merger did occur, their teams would instantly be worth the 70 Million or so NFL franchises were worth at that time --- tripling, quadrupling, or more their cash investment. Eddie Einhorn Donald Trump
On October 18, 1984, the league's owners voted to go along with Einhorn and Trump's idea and begin playing a fall season in 1986. The spring advocates had lost and the fall advocates would accept nothing less than victory vs. the NFL, either by forcing a merger or winning a sizeable settlement and securing a TV network for fall broadcasts. Spring football had been replaced with an incredibly risky gamble for a huge return.
This vote would permanently destroy the viability of the league by taking it out of several viable large markets. It would directly lead to the end of USFL play in 6 cities --- Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Detroit, Houston, and Denver --- and the USFL not coming to Miami. Additionally, one of the chief advocates of the move to the fall was Einhorn. With an expectation of Fall play in 1986, Einhorn decided not to field a team for the final Spring 1985 season --- effectively ending USFL play in Chicago, a 7th USFL city. lame duck
As a direct result of this decision, the Pittsburgh Maulers rather than compete with the Steelers, the sale of the struggling Washington Federals , the well supported Philadelphia Stars and the New Orleans Breakers had to relocate, and the 1983 champion Michigan Panthers suprised the commissioner with an announcement that they would not be playing in Michigan for the 1985 season.( that they had negotiated a conditional merger with Tad Taube's Oakland Invaders depending on the outcome of the vote.) folded to the Miami ownership group collapsed The Panthers management informed the league at the meeting
ABC offered the USFL a 4 year, $175 Million dollar TV deal to play in the spring in 1986. ESPN offerred $70M over 3 years. Following all the mergers and shutdowns, there just were not enough spring football advocates left in the league to accept those contracts. The owners in the league walked away from what averaged out to $67 Million dollars per year starting in 1986 to pursue their big picture --- merger with the NFL.
After the 1985 season, more plans were announced to accommodate the fall schedule, pool financial resources and avoid costly head-to-head competition with NFL teams. Two mergers were announced. The Denver Gold merged with the Jacksonville Bulls(to play in Jacksonville). Trump bought the assets of The Houston Gamblers for an undisclosed amount and merged them with the New Jersey Generals (to play in New Jersey). In spite of all of these changes, the USFL would never play a fall game.

The USFL claimed that the NFL had bullied ABC, and into not televising USFL games in the fall. It also claimed that the NFL had a specific plan to eliminate the USFL, the "Porter Presentation."

Most importantly, the jury found that the NFL did not attempt to force the USFL off television. In essence, the jury felt that while the USFL was harmed by the NFL's of pro football in the United States, most of its problems were due to its own mismanagement. It awarded the USFL only one dollar in nominal damages, which was tripled under antitrust law to three dollars. It later emerged that the jury incorrectly assumed that the judge could increase the award. de facto monopolization
The verdict was a classic . The USFL had essentially staked its future on the outcome of the suit, and considered the television-related claims to be the heart of its case. Almost immediately upon announcement of the verdict, it announced it was suspending operations for the 1986 season, with the intent of returning in 1987. Players signed to contracts were free to sign with NFL (or other professional teams) immediately. Indeed, the NFL had held a draft in 1984 for teams to acquire the rights to USFL players, in the event of the league (or teams in the league) folding. However, it is unlikely the USFL would have been able to put together a viable product in any case. Many of its players had signed contracts with NFL teams after the 1985 season, and the league was some $160 million in debt. With nearly all of its players under contract to the NFL and , Usher announced the league would stay shuttered in 1987 as well. Pyrrhic victory Canadian Football League
The USFL appealed the award, but it was rejected by the in 1988. This decision ended any chance of the USFL returning to the field, and the league formally dissolved shortly afterward. However, due to a provision of antitrust law which allows an "injured" party in an antitrust action to recover its and costs of litigation, the USFL was awarded over $5.5 million in attorney fees and over $62,000 in court costs.

Though the NFL would be loath to admit it during the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s, it is widely acknowledged that the USFL had a dramatic impact on the both on the field and off.

It was no coincidence that most of these markets were in the Sun Belt--a region where the USFL was particularly a hit.

Along with Philadelphia/Baltimore (the league's most successful team) and New Jersey (with its biggest star, Walker), these teams at least had the potential to be viable ventures had the USFL been better run.
