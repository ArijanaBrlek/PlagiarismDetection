- Does Volvo Really Need An XC90 With A V8 Engine? The Market Would Seem To Think So. Andy Enright Reports ...VOLVO ON A ROLL
VOLVO
Safety is the area where Swedish manufacturer Volvo traditionally excels. The firm was started in 1927 by Asaar Gabrielsson after his wife died in a car accident. He vowed to produce the safest cars possible as a result and the motor manufacturing arm of the Volvo corporation has done a sterling job of living up to its founder's vision ever since.
Down the years, Volvo engineers have been the originators of numerous technologies that subsequently went on to become standard across the automotive industry. The laminated windscreen in 1944, the three-point seat belt in 1959, energy-absorbent crumple zones in 1966, rear seat belts in 1967, ABS brakes in 1984, a driver's airbag in 1987, ISOFIX child seat attachments in 2000, they all appeared first on a Volvo.
More recently, Volvo has aligned itself with the Swedish tradition of elegant, minimalist design. Its cars, once criticised for being boxy and dull in appearance despite their safety attributes, started to take on sleeker more appealing forms with innovative interiors. The current range is edgier and more youthful than ever before, offering a real alternative to the German premium brands.
Volvo benefits greatly from engine and chassis technologies developed by parent company Ford particularly at the lower end of its range. The cars are still distinctly Volvo, however, with a character all of their own. Highlights of the current line-up include the C30, a premium hatchback with a strong sporty element, and the XC90, a luxury 4x4 with a versatile, family-friendly interior.
