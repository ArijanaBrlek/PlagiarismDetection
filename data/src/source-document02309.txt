The National Security Directorate at (PNNL) delivers high-impact, science-based, practical solutions to our clients to prevent and counter acts of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our research and development efforts are focused on the following: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
predict, prevent and mitigate acts of terrorism through predictive analysis
counter threats posed by the global expansion of nuclear energy and legacy weapons of mass destruction (WMD) materials
detect the production, characteristics and movement of weapons of mass destruction and effect
respond more rapidly and effectively to events of mass effect.
Our talented scientists and engineers work on identifying and understanding proliferation and terrorism signatures, systems to collect materials, sensors to quantify and characterize these materials and techniques that assist in analyzing possible terrorism events. Were making significant contributions to counterterrorism and infrastructure protection, including teaming with organizations to ensure our air and seaports are protected from terrorist attacks. Around the globe and at home, were training border enforcement officialsas well as U.S. Customs inspectorsto thwart the smuggling of chemical, biological or nuclear materials across borders.
Our capabilities cross-cut market needs. A major strength is our ability to integrate our research and projects across PNNL and take them to market. Our ability to integrate across disciplines allows us to take a systems approach to solving problems. We can focus on one aspect of a problem or come up with a systems solution that addresses various aspects of the problem, ranging from early detection to decision-making and taking action.
We are committed to providing excellent service to our clients to help make our world safe and more secure.
