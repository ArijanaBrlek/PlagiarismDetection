Curriculum Report
Lessons Learned
Talking with the engineers at the company about what things they feel that high school students should know and how to get more students interested in engineering. Many of them had some really good ideas, which I incorporated into the curriculum plan I did. It was also good for me to see what is new in engineering and manufacturing since I left the field 7 years ago.
I did do some engineering design and calculations for them and worked on improving two of their processes. I found it to be very rewarding.
The implementation of my externship curriculum plan met my expectations. I did a presentation as an introduction to engineering and then had the students “design” a new product. They had a great time working on the project and some of them are considering engineering as a major in college. I think what really got them interested was showing them great engineering feats, such as some of the skyscrapers, advanced aircraft, and computers.
My hosts gave me advice about the plan, but they were not directly involved in the plan. They have offered to host a field trip and tour for the students though and would talk about engineering and manufacturing with the students then. We may do that in the Spring.
 
Impact on Student Learning
I was able to show them real-world applications of the science topics that they are learning in my class. The students got more motivated to learn the material because they now see the application of it. The project also showed them how fun and “cool” engineering and manufacturing can be.
Externship Sustainability
I am trying to get some other teachers to apply for the externship. Personally, I am going to use the curriculum plan each year with the physics classes as a way to engage and motivate them.
