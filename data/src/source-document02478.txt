About Our Studio
The trombone and euphonium studio at Oklahoma State University is extremely active. Members of the studio have won competitions sponsored by the Music Teacher’s National Association, Down Beat Magazine, Eastern Trombone Workshop, International Trombone Association, Glenn Miller Birthplace Society, Oklahoma Music Olympics and the Crescendo Music Awards.
There is tremendous support and friendship among the studio members, and this helps everyone develop in the most positive way. The central studio themes are versatility and attention. Studio members are encouraged to have specific professional goals, but they are also guided to be as versatile as possible. Most students are comfortable playing several styles and many double on other instruments.
Studio members also receive attention from Professor Compton beyond the average weekly lesson. OSU performance majors receive two hour long lessons each week, and all other studio members receive at least one hour long lesson. Professor Compton also leads fundamental routine sessions every morning, which any studio member may attend. Professor Compton coaches trombone ensembles and sectionals, and he regularly assists with accompanist rehearsals and recording sessions. The ultimate goal of the OSU trombone and euphonium studio is to improve daily, and the extra attention helps ensure this.
