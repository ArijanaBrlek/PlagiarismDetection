Reporting informally from the Naval Store House, Bogue Island, Fleet Paymaster Upham detailed the situation surrounding the Confederate's investment of New Berne, N.C., which included a skirmish at Newport involving the Ninth Vermont Regiment, which suffered 160 casualties. The enemy had destroyed a large quantity of naval stores, captured the railroad and telegraph and five gunboats, destroying one of them in the process.

Dove, 'was not only a great loss to us, but a great assistance to the enemy, as they seem to be living mostly on corn, peanuts, and sweep potatoes.' Later in the day, Colonel Ripley 'made a reconnoissance toward Newport and found that the rebels had fallen back again.' (ORN) Minnesota

The Ninth Vermont Regiment participated in an expedition to cut the railroad between Wilmington and Goldsboro, N.C. The majority of the regiment went overland by train and marching to be close to Jacksonville, Onslow County, by June 21. Captain Samuel H. Kelley and 100 men went to Beaufort. On June 20, the side-wheel steamer Nansemond and the screw steamer Calypso embarked Kelley's men and sailed to New River, N. C. The troops were successfully landed in surfboats on June 21. Captain Kelley and his men moved up the river about eight miles, took possession of Snead's Ferry and captured several Confederate pickets. The next evening, Kelley's force came under friendly fire from the 12th New York Cavalry. The mission was aborted due to the size of the Confederate force in the area (apparently the rebels had obtained intelligence regarding the expedition), and Captain Kelley and his men returned to Beaufort. Reporting to Commander Benjamin M. Dove, Naval Station, Beaufort, Acting Ensign J. H. Porter, commanding one of the boats from the Calypso, said of Kelley 'he has been untiringly at work ever since his first landing, and though more than once in difficult positions, has managed his part of the expedition with perfect success.'
