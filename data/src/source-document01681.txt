  The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 have beensuggested to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis.The expression of these receptors in human cervical cancer,however, has seldom been characterized.   Tumor cell invasion and subsequent dissemination via the bloodstreamand lymph vessels are critical steps in the progression of malignanttumors, including cervical cancer. The mechanisms involved inlymph node metastasis, however, are not fully understood. Ina previous study, we demonstrated that the expression of vascularendothelial growth factor-C is involved in the promotion oflymph node metastasis in cervical cancer []. The determinationof such a predictive molecular marker that is correlated withlymph node metastasis might be important in elucidating themechanism of metastasis.   In this study, we examined 174 patients presenting with theInternational Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)stages IBIIB cervical cancers. Each of these patientsunderwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy atthe Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Okayama UniversityMedical School. Tumor specimens were obtained at the time ofsurgery and were immediately fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalinand embedded in paraffin. Informed consent was obtained fromeach patient before sample collection. Histological cell typingwas conducted according to the World Health Organisation classificationsas follows: 102 were classified as squamous cell carcinomas,49 as adenocarcinomas, and 23 as adenosquamous carcinomas. Clinicalstaging was assessed based on the FIGO staging system as follows:92 were allocated to stage IB, four to stage IIA, and 78 tostage IIB. The median age at the time of surgery was 46 years(range 2567 years). Patients with lymph node metastasis,parametrial involvement, deep stromal invasion, or marked lymphvascularspace involvement were treated with an adjuvant external whole-pelvicirradiation, combination chemotherapy, or chemoradiation. Disease-freesurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were definedas the interval from the initial surgery to clinically or radiologicallyproven recurrence and death, respectively. The end date of thefollow-up study for conducting the analysis was 31 March 2006,and the median duration of the follow-up was 56.5 months (range1131 months).   shows the representative immunostainingprofiles of CXCR4 in cervical cancer specimens. In normal cervicaltissues, we found no distinct CXCR4 staining. Of the 174 tumorsamples examined, 110 (63%) were positively stained and 64 (37%)were negatively stained. The association between CXCR4 expressionand clinicopathological factors is shown in . CXCR4 expressionwas significantly higher in elderly patients ( = 0.025) andin FIGO stage II tumors ( = 0.024); it was also significantlyelevated in patients with cancers showing large tumor size (= 0.010), deep stromal invasion ( = 0.0004), lymphvascularspace involvement ( = 0.0002), or lymph node metastasis (< 0.0001). Furthermore, no significant association was observedbetween CXCR4 immunoreactivity and histological type, vaginalinvasion, parametrial invasion, or ovarian metastasis.    shows the characteristic immunostaining profilesof CCR7 in cervical cancer specimens. In normal cervical tissues,we found no distinct CCR7 staining. Of the 174 tumor samples,102 (59%) were positively stained and 72 (41%) were negativelystained. The association between CCR7 expression and clinicopathologicalfactors is shown in . CCR7 expression was significantlyhigher in FIGO stage II cases ( < 0.0001) and squamous cellcarcinomas ( = 0.010); it was also significantly increasedin patients with cancers showing large tumor size ( < 0.0001),deep stromal invasion ( < 0.0001), vaginal invasion ( =0.047), lymphvascular space involvement ( = 0.012),or lymph node metastasis ( < 0.0001). Furthermore, no significantassociation was observed between CCR7 immunoreactivity and age,parametrial invasion, or ovarian metastasis.  We noticed nuclear CCR7 staining in 24 samples (14%). shows the representative immunostaining profile of nuclear CCR7in cervical cancer. The association between nuclear CCR7 expressionand clinicopathological factors is shown in . NuclearCCR7 expression was significantly lower in patients with cancersshowing vascular space involvement ( = 0.039). There was nosignificant association between nuclear CCR7 immunoreactivityand any other clinicopathological factor.  The predictors of lymph node metastasis were determined by stepwiselogistic regression analysis. Pelvic lymph node metastasis wascorrelated with tumor size, stromal invasion, parametrial invasion,lymphvascular space involvement, ovarian metastasis,and CXCR4 and CCR7 expression status (). Multivariateanalysis revealed that deep stromal invasion ( = 0.017) andCXCR4 ( = 0.016) and CCR7 ( = 0.022) expression were the independentfactors that influenced pelvic lymph node metastasis.  presents the DFS curves of the 174 patients with cervicalcancer on the basis of the CXCR4 expression status. Both theDFS and OS rates of patients exhibiting CXCR4 expression weresignificantly lower than those of patients lacking CXCR4 expression( = 0.025 and = 0.0001, respectively). presentsthe DFS curves of the 174 patients with cervical cancer on thebasis of the CCR7 expression status. Both the DFS and OS ratesof patients exhibiting CCR7 expression were significantly lowerthan those of patients demonstrating the lack of CCR7 expression( = 0.006 and = 0.038, respectively). Furthermore, the DFSand OS rates of patients exhibiting both CXCR4 and CCR7 expressionwere significantly poor ( < 0.0001) (). There wasno association between nuclear CCR7 expression and patient outcome.The results of the univariate survival analyses of other variablesare shown in .        We examined the prognostic value of both CXCR4 and CCR7 expressionusing the Cox proportional hazard model. Multivariate analysisshowed that lymph node metastasis was the only independent prognosticfactor for DFS [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2010.87; = 0.022]. In addition, non-squamous cell carcinoma was thestrongest independent prognostic factor for OS, followed byboth CXCR4 and CCR7 expression (95% CI 1.0910.20, =0.035, and 95% CI 1.0317.86, = 0.046, respectively).   This is the first study analyzing CXCR4 and CCR7 protein expressionsin a large series of human cervical cancer specimens. We demonstratedthat both CXCR4 and CCR7 expression is significantly higherin patients with cancers displaying large tumor sizes, deepstromal invasion, lymphvascular space involvement, orlymph node metastasis. Furthermore, CXCR4 expression was significantlyhigher in elderly patients, while CCR7 expression was significantlygreater in patients with cancers exhibiting vaginal invasion.The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that bothCXCR4 and CCR7 expression influenced pelvic lymph node metastasisindependently. This finding indicates that both CXCR4 and CCR7expression is up-regulated in cases with positive nodes andmay contribute to the lymph node metastasis occurring in cervicalcancers. The present data are consistent with previous reportsthat describe a positive correlation between CXCR4 expressionand lymph node metastasis in cases of non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC), nasopharyngeal cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophagealcancer []. Positive correlation has also been reportedbetween CCR7 expression and lymph node metastasis in cases ofNSCLC, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagealcancer, prostate cancer, and oral and oropharyngeal squamouscell carcinoma [, ]. Although the role of chemokinesand their receptors in human cancers is complex, the chemokinereceptors CXCR4 and/or CCR7 may have a critical role in determininglymph node metastasis in these kinds of tumors.   We would like to Chisae Kodera for her help with histochemistryand in the preparation of sections.   1.
