I can't believe how happy I am to type this title. This show ever so narrowly missed making our TWoP 10 of just last week (seriously, it was a tough call between that and ), and now that we'll actually be getting more of it! In the form of a direct-to-DVD movie. I'll take what I can get. The one catch? Mandy Patinkin isn't in it. I kind of liked him as the boss of the reapers, but in general I'm not a huge fan ( being the other exception). So I was torn about his absence. Until I saw who was replacing him. It's one Mr. Henry Ian Cusick! Those fans out there should know him better as Desmond. He's fabulous. And I think I won't be missing Mr. Patinkin one bit. shows that were canceled too soon Wonderfalls word comes Princess BrideLost
