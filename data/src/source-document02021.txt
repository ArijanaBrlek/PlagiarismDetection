Hi its me, Jim! Thansk for visiting my website! I've got my cousin Ryan to thank for this bit of nonsense.He designed the original site and I am learning to edit. Yes, this site is a work in progress.
Jim's Karaoke
Jim's Karaoke pays the bills (SOMETIMES). Jim has been doing shows in and around Pinellas County, Florida for well over 15 years and has made a lot of great friends (and very few enemies). With well over 14,585 selections and a top-of-the-line system Jim's shows attract a faithful following of terrific singers who appreciate quality sound. Jim has been pushing buttons and twisting knobs longer than he would care to admit. By the way, May 25th is Jim's birthday. Be sure to send gifts.
Jim's Music
Jim is a SINGER, first and formost, and that's how he found his way into the KARAOKE business. It allows him to keep on singing and to eke out a meager living. He is also a songwriter who,to date,has had 100 songs copyrighted but not yet published. In all actuality they may never be published because they weren't written for the mainstream. They were written for Jim and for anyone who might share his tastes and sensibilities. He has recorded seven CDs in his home performing all parts on guitars, keyboards,mandoline, guitar synth,various percussion electronic and organic. If things go as planned, samples will be available soon.If you're interested e-mail or call (727) 536-7524. CDs available for 10.00 CHEAP!!!
