Tiny Tickets - Paws for a Cause
In 2001, BART and the East Bay Community Foundation introduced a new campaign, "Tiny Tickets," to encourage BART riders to donate the unused portion of their BART tickets to local nonprofit organizations. Tiny tickets are those hoards of BART tickets, often discarded or left in pockets or drawers, that have tiny bits of value left on them, a nickel, a dime, and more in some cases, that could be turned into cash.
So, If you have $0.10, $0.15 or $0.35 BART tickets lying around and want to donate them to a GREAT cause, 3A Pet Sitting has found a solution:Furry Friends Rescue.
Just mail your BART tickets with your next payment, leave them out on your next service request, or call us and we will pick them up.3A Pet Sitting has set a goal of $500 in 2007.
Help with this challenge and help the animals win!
