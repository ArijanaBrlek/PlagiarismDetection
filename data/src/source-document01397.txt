In January of 2007 David will be instructing at the first ever "Beginner Mobile Entertainer Certification Program" to be offered in conjunction with a Community College Continued Education & Certification Program. Through the co-support of FAME and the Non-Profit organization, FMEG (Florida Mobile Entertainment Group) David hopes to have the Program in more than 20 Community Colleges across the State of Florida by 2009. I became involved with FAME because I first and foremost wanted to do everything I can as an industry leader to support educational opportunities offered to upcoming DJs. The Mobile Entertainment Industry has been very good to me and this is my chance to give something back to the DJs that will come along in the future.
