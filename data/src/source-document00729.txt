TORTA DI NOCI, CIOCCOLATA E ZENZERO or WALNUT CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE AND CANDIED GINGER
The other day my son came back with a sack full of newly picked walnuts and who can resist that!? Especially not me who is Swedish and therefore not at all spoilt when it comes to, in my eyes, exotic products as this! Moving to Italy and living here as a native was like open the doors to paradise for me! Finally I was able to buy lots of vegetables that I couldnt find in Sweden, not to speak about cheese, meat products, fish etc.! I was almost drunk by all the new possibilities I saw opening up before me and I cooked, cooked and cooked! I have calmed down a bit now but I still enjoy the wide variety of ingredients that I can find here like the walnuts, so when he turned up with all these nuts I immediately felt that I had to make a cake and here it is!
TORTA DI NOCI, CIOCCOLATA E ZENZERO or WALNUT CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE AND CANDIED GINGER
3 eggs
250-300 ml/1-1,25 cup brown sugar
100 g/3,5 oz butter
150 g/5,3 oz chopped walnuts
100 g/3,5 oz chopped dark chocolate
3 tsp finely chopped candied ginger, you can add more if you want, I just wanted it as a background flavour
300 ml/1,25 cup flour
- Mix egg and sugar in a bowl while you are melting the butter on low heat.
- When the butter has cooled down, you add it to the bowl together with the nuts, the chocolate and the ginger and when it is well blended you add the flour.
- Pour the whole into a greased and bread-crumbed cake pan and bake it in a pre-heated oven (175 C/350 F) until it is ready, approx. 20-30 minutes but check it with a tooth pick to be sure!
