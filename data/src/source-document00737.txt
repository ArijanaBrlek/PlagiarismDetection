Thai jasmine rice produced in Ubon Ratchathani Province in Thailand is popular among foreigners, particularly among people in Chengdu of China.
The great taste , good smell and soft grain of the well-known Thai jasmine rice are its exceptional characteristics that attract more people to try.
However, the export of Thai jasmine rice is confronting a tough challenge of species mutation. The mixture of various types of rice into sacks of the Thai jasmine rice has made when the rice was passed through intermediaries in Shenzhen and Sichuan of China before sending to Chengdu.

Ubon Ratchathani is preparing to negotiate with China to find solution to the problem. Meanwhile, Thai middlemen will be promoted as an alternative to ease the problem.
