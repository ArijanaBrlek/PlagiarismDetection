thats right folks... you can have your own genuine website for less than the cost of a new egronomic keyboard...
lets start with some hardware... you will want:
1 Computer
1 copy of apache server
1 highspeed intenet connection
1 disk with atleast 10gb
STEP1
Acquire a computer, i got mine from a local comunity collece, its a COMPAQ IPAQ, 800 MHZ celeron processor, 512 mb ram, 10 gb hdd, windows xp profressional. <no cd drive>
once you have your compuer, all you need to do is install apache web server... not to hard, its a great step by step installer...
<i have no idea how to make links here, so just google it...>
step 3
design your website, and post it into your apache webserver folder, wherever it is supposed to go... i think it is HT DOCS
step 4: plug in your network cable. and make sure that your computer has its own STATIC IP, and that you have either a VNC installed, or REMOTE DESTKOP enabled ( i did both)
step 5: poke a hole in your routers firewall to allow a webserver
step 6: get a dynamic dns address from www.dyndns.com
step 7, remove your monitor, mouse, and any other cable you can that still allows it to start (i have a keyboard controller on a usb dongle to keep it from crashing on boot up, because it does not boot without keyboard)
step 8: post your site here, so that others can see it
