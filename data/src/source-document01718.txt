Snowshoeing, glacier exploration, Northern Lights and the best of southern Iceland in winter - a great time to visit this fascinating island
We split our time in Iceland between the rugged south coast and the lively capital Reykjavik. Our first base at Drangshlid looks south across the coastal plains to the sea. Behind us lies the massive Myrdalsjokul ice-cap, from whose heights tumble the Solheimjokul glacier and the famous Skogafoss waterfall. We spend a full day exploring the glacier and a day snowshoeing in the hills behind the waterfall. Moving back west, we take in the 'must-see' sights of Gullfoss waterfall, the geothermal waterspouts at Geysir and the volcanic rift at historic Thingvellir. Then from our Reykjavik base we take day trips for further snowshoe exploration to Mount Hengil and Glymur waterfall.
