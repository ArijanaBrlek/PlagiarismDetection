Examples of European agglutinative languages are the , such as , and . These have highly agglutinated expressions in daily usage, and most words are bisyllabic or longer. Grammatical information expressed by in Western is typically found in suffixes. For example, the Finnish word means "in my house, too". Derivation can also be quite complex. For example, Finnish has the root "logos", and consists of negative-""-----"related to"-"property", and means "the property of being unsystematic," "unsystematicalness." The word has lots of stem changes, so Finnish is not the best example of an agglutinative language.

[] edit Extremes of agglutination
It is possible to construct artificial extreme examples of agglutination, which have no real use, but illustrate the theoretical capability of the grammar to agglutinate. This is not a question of "long words", since some languages permit limitless combinations with compound words, negative clitics or such, which can be (and are) expressed with an analytic structure in actual usage.
The English language, missing inflectional agglutination, can use only derivational Latin agglutination, as in e.g. . Agglutinative languages often have more complex derivational agglutination than isolating languages, so they can do the same to a much larger extent. For example, in Hungarian, a word such as , which means "for [the purposes of] undenationalizationability" can find actual use. Using inflectional agglutination, these can be extended. For example, the official Guinness world record is Finnish "I wonder if even with his/her quality of not having been made unsystematized". It has the derived word as the root and is lengthened with the inflectional endings . However, this word is grammatically unusual, since "also" is used only in negative clauses, but (question) only in question clauses. antidisestablishmentarianism elnemzetietlen thetetlens gnekep j rjestelm llistytt m tt myydell ns k nk h nep j rjestelm llistytt m tt myys-ll ns k nk h n-k n-k
