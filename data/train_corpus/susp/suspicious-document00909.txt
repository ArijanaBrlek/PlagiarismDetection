Hamlet only wants to find peace and equilibrium within himself. Most people after the death of a family member tries to deal with the death by meeting with other family members and consoling each. other.  Here is where Hamlet loses his balance 'mentally'  Hamlet's mother has married her brother-in-law and therefore is living in sin according to the era in which this play was wrote. This leaves Hamlet with no family member to console with, thus he ends up having to deal with his fathers death in his own confused way.       The next misunderstanding comes when the ghost confronted the guard at the tower and they went  and got the Prince, The majority of the penple in the world would have neither ran away from the ghosts or would have passed them off as a delusion of grievous people.
