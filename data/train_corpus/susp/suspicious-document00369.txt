of the vinyl is very large volumes of hazardous waste produced by inadvertence and organo-published in miljon.Vinyl d ' other major chemical components of VCM and EDC has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Production of VCM unsurprisingly large polluters. Raw materials, additives and by-products that are produced and released during the life cycle of PVC has been shown to cause a variety of health problems, in some cases at extremely low doses. PVC and PVC SD is already helping Europe to develop sustainability. The PVC is extremely durable and at the end of life, it can be recycled without important qualities.

Yes recent studies showed that vinyl products are safe and acceptable for the environment throughout their lives (from the extraction of the material recycling or disposal) than other commonly used materials and, in fact, may be better than other alternatives. Current objectives to reduce the
consumption of resources (materials and energy use in production) is set when this is
justified on economic and environmental plan

the worst plastic from an environmental health perspective, dangerous throughout its entire life cycle of production, use and disposal. Consumers can identify
it by searching for the number "3", "PVC" or the letter
