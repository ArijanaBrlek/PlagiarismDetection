Emperor Moth (Saturniidae)
Moths
Although moths and butterflies are closely related, only a few species of butterflies are adapted to living on peatlands, whereas a large number of moths have made it their home. Peatland plants provide a food source for more than 150 species of moths, with at least 50 species feeding on Heather. Although moths are one of the most abundant peatlands insect groups, they have often been overlooked in the past because many species are only active at night and are often difficult to identify. Information about some of the most conspicuous and also some threatened species of peatlands moths is given in the table below.
