Cetuximab is believed to operate by binding to the extracellular domain of the of all cells that express EGFR, preventing ligand binding and activation of the receptor. This blocks the downstream signaling of EGFR resulting in impaired cell growth and proliferation. Cetuximab has also been shown to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (). EGFR ADCC
