MediaMVP is a Linux based digital media receiver. Inside MediaMVP is a high performance IBM PowerPC processor and a hardware MPEG audio/ video decoder for MPEG-1/2 videos and MP3 music. MediaMVP receives digital media from the PC via the Ethernet LAN, decodes the media and outputs audio/video to the TV set through the S-Video and composite A/V connectors. Digital pictures are software decoded by MediaMVP’s processor.
When used in conjunction with a Hauppauge WinTV PVR installed in the home PC, a complete home TV and digital media distribution system can be made. Use in combination with the WinTV PVR to record your favorite TV shows on the home PC, then watch recordings on a TV set through the MediaMVP via the home network. Beyond TV
