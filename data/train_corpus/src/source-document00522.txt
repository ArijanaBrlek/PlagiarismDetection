Never let it be said that James Dobson does not have his good points. For one, without the Grand Old Patriarch, we wouldn't fall off our chair in hilarious liberal feminist laughter nearly so often.
As we know, if you ain't Christian in America, you can run, but you can't win. And if you're a Republican, and Dobson marks you as a non Christian, well, you better stay in Hollywood with all those other heathens. Sure, Thompson is polling as number three among the other old white male GOPers, but Daddy Dobson has spoken!
Somebody tell the folks over at the Fred Thompson is our Daddy blog, the dream born of desperation is so ovah! Face it guys, you are stuck with the cross-dresser.
: Dobson sure did a nice job of keeping Fred in the .RELATED limelight
