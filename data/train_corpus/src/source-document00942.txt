Surveys have provided some cost information but examined plant size and other indirect effects with limited data and did not make cost estimates of direct cost components, such as mandated tasks. This paper addresses those deficiencies with data from a national survey of meat and poultry plants on PR/HACCP costs. Results indicate that (1) mandated tasks are the most costly component of the PR/HACCP rule, (2) regulation favors large plants over small ones, and (3) private actions are nearly as costly as direct regulation. ______________________________ "Linking Investment Spikes and Productivity Growth: U.S. Food Manufacturing Industry" US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies Paper No. CES-WP-08-36 Author: PINAR CELIKKOL GEYLANI Duquesne University Auth-Page: http://ssrn.com/author=1139057 Contact: SPIRO E.

We find that productivity growth increases after investment spikes suggesting an efficiency gain or plants' learning effect. However, efficiency and the learning period associated with investment spikes differ among plants' productivity quartile ranks implying the differences in the plants' investment types such as expansionary, replacement or retooling. We find evidence of both convex and non-convex types of adjustment costs where lumpy plant-level investments suggest the possibility of non-convex adjustment costs and hazard estimation results suggest the possibility of convex adjustment costs. The downward sloping hazard can be due to the unobserved heterogeneity across plants such as plants' idiosyncratic obsolescence caused by different R&D capabilities and implies the existence of convex adjustment costs. Food plants frequently invest during their first few years of operation and high productivity plants postpone investing due to high fixed costs. ______________________________ "Gender Differences in Business Performance: Evidence from the Characteristics of Business Owners Survey" US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies Paper No. CES-WP- 08-39 Author: ROBERT W.

Using regression estimates and a decomposition technique, we explore the role that human capital, especially through prior work experience, and financial capital play in contributing to why female-owned businesses have lower survival rates, profits, employment and sales. We find that female-owned businesses are less successful than male-owned businesses because they have less startup capital, and business human capital acquired through prior work experience in a similar business and prior work experience in family business. We also find some evidence that female-owned businesses work fewer hours and may have different preferences for the goals of their business. ______________________________ "Computer Network Use and Firms' Productivity Performance: The United States vs. Japan" US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies Paper No. CES-WP- 08-30 Contact: B.K.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis using firm-level data for the manufacturing sector of both countries. We find that the links between IT and productivity differ between U.S. and Japanese manufacturing. Computer networks have positive and significant links with labor productivity in both countries. However, that link is roughly twice as large in the U.S. as in Japan. Differences in how businesses use computers have clear links with productivity for U.S. manufacturing, but not in Japan. For the United States, the coefficients of the intensity of network use are positive and increase with the number of processes. Coefficients of specific uses of those networks are positive and significant. None of these coefficients are significant for Japan. Our findings are robust to alternative econometric specifications. They also are robust to expanding our sample from single-unit manufacturing firms, which are comparable in the two data sets, to the entire manufacturing sector in each country, as well as to the wholesale and retail sector of Japan. __________________________________________________________________ S O L I C I T A T I O N O F A B S T R A C T S To submit your research to SSRN, log in to the SSRN User HeadQuarters, http://hq.ssrn.com, and click on the My Papers link on the left menu, and then click on Start New Submission at the top of the page. _________________________________________________________________ D I S T R I B U T I O N S E R V I C E S If your Institution is interested in learning more about increasing readership for its research by becoming a Partner in Publishing or starting a Research Paper Series, please email: Management@SSRN.com. _________________________________________________________________ D I S T R I B U T E D B Y Entrepreneurship Research & Policy Network (ERPN), a division of Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
