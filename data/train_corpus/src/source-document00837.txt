What's Our Philosophy?
You (or your team) already have the knowledge to solve most of the challenges you face.
Day-to-day tactical pressures often prevent focusing on issues that are the true drivers of success.
It is essential to break away from the daily grind, turn the cell phones and laptops off and let the wisdom that is in you (and your team) rise to the top.
That knowledge can be quickly brought to surface and transformed into real-life practice with the help of facilitators trained in powerful, fun experience-based learning techniques.
High performance teams that play together work well together. Our process is fun and our outcomes are effective.
Collaboration that truly involves everyone - both the introspective and the vocal - yields better solutions and is more universally embraced by the team.

“My most respected colleague, Rebecca Stockley, sent me an email last year from San Francisco about Leif that said, 'He's a detail guy working with the big picture, and he brings a remarkable tech savvy to support it all.”Talk to this guy if he calls you. He gets it.' And I did and he does.

Leif teaches and leads (but can't fake ID in the opposite age direction). Teaching is a passion with Leif, and whose life couldn't use a whole lot of Wonderosity.seminars that tickle the right brains of exactly the people who should have had improv in elementary school

His specialty seems to be "consensus building" and his strengths are in an ability to connect with people on a very personal level."Leif is non-judgemental, open, approachable and an excellent coach.
