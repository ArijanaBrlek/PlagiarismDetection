Andover’s economic base evolved from agriculture to industry during the 18th century. The region's first powder mill was established in 1775; the manufacture of paper began in 1789; and in the early nineteenth century, several textile mills prospered.
Education became an important local “industry” with the establishment of three academic institutions. Phillips Academy, founded in 1770, is one of the nation’s oldest preparatory schools. Abbott Academy, established in 1828 as one of New England’s first female academies, merged with Phillips Academy in 1973. The Andover Theological Seminary (1807), now part of Andover Newton Theological Seminary and the oldest graduate school of theology in the United States, was responsible for the American missionary movement.
