OUR NEAREST STAR IS ALPHA CENTAURI
WRONG!
Our nearest star is called the Sun. All the stars in the sky which we can see are similar to the Sunthey are massive thermonuclear explosions just like a hydrogen bomb. Our Sun is about half way through its lifetime but still has enough nuclear fuel to keep the explosion going for about another thousand million years! In fact our Sun is a rather boringly average star..there are lots much bigger (or smaller) and lots much hotter (or cooler) than the Sun. The Sun just happens to be so bright to us because we are so close to it. If you were on Pluto it would not seem much bigger than the rest of the stars - it would however be a lot brighter than them (but not enough to warm you up!)
