Resource & Ecosystem Management
The product line serves clients that have complex environmental problems related to chemical, hazardous, or radioactive materials characterization, facilities and site management, restoration, institutional issues, or stewardship of natural resources. These organizations need to mitigate contamination of the environment, address waste and resource management issues, or conduct research to gain a better understanding of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that affect the environment. They must meet federal and state regulations and mandates for maintaining or restoring sites to some agreed-upon condition, conduct activities to minimize impacts to the environment, or conduct research to provide the scientific basis for policy and regulatory actions to protect the health of the environment and humans. The REM product line provides value to our clients through our ability to understand the problems based on our past involvement and experience, then assemble an integrated team of experts to solve the problems. We are able to bring custom-designed tools and technologies to bear on the problem that provide our clients with innovative and cost effective solutions to their problems.
