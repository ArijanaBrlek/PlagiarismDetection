Selling Your Home
Loading...
When selling your home, the same preparation and diligence should be exercised as when you were the buyer. Preparation and attention to detail often sets a home apart from the rest, meaning both the seller and the buyer come out as the winners.
A PRE-LISTING INSPECTION, commissioned by the seller, can provide a significant advantage in the sales process. Advance awareness of the issues, and repair of some or all of them, will often help to move the home faster and at a higher selling price. Chances are good that many of the defects will be reported when the buyer commissions an inspection, at which time it can become a costly and complicated ordeal for the seller.
The following resources are not intended to be an exhaustive list, however, we think they provide a good starting point for success in the home selling process and will answer many of your questions.
