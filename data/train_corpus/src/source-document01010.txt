How to Wind a Sewing Machine Bobbin
Before you can start sewing with a sewing machine, you must wind thread around the bobbin. The exact method for winding a bobbin varies slightly depending on the type of sewing machine you’re using, but the general process is as follows:
Place an empty bobbin on the bobbin winder.
Place a spool of thread on the spool pin.
Wind the thread through the thread guides used for bobbin winding (see the owner’s manual for your machine), then pull a tail of a few inches through one of the holes in the bobbin’s rim.
 
While holding the tail of thread from the bobbin, run the sewing machine by pressing the pedal. The bobbin winder will spin, and the bobbin will take up the thread.
Keep an eye on the thread to ensure that it winds evenly up and down the spool’s shaft. Don’t wind more thread onto the bobbin than is indicated (usually by a groove on the bobbin’s rim).
