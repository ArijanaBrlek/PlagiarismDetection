SCREEN GEMS
A staple of late-night TV, infomercials (along with the products they sell and the people who pitch them) have developed something of a cult following. The spots, which run anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes, always seem to sell things that fix a problem you didn’t know you had — from chopping veggies to turning an ant farm into a thriving metropolis. Now you can get a closeup look at these amazing gadgets, thanks to . With a small prototype now open at Paradise Valley Mall, about 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix, shoppers get the chance to test the products that entice insomniacs at 3 a.m. The Vidalia onion chopper is a top seller, as is Jack Zatorski’s Push Up Pro exercise device. Virtually everything infomercial pitchman Billy Mays promotes is available, including his popular Hercules Hooks. The store is organized into personal care, tools, home, family, and kitchen departments, so even if you’re there to test the Kiro travel pillow, you can also pick up some Moon Sand for a friend. Oh, and the average price of products? You guessed it: $19.95. For more info, call 602.324.8996.Sandstrom’s As Seen On TV Store

ON THE CASE
America’s fascination with crime, criminals, and the justice system is getting a formal recognition. — the only one of its kind in the world — opens this month in D.C. The museum provides an unvarnished, unromanticized history of criminals, police detectives, the courts, and incarceration. Hundreds of historical artifacts, including Jesse James’ revolver, Al Capone’s shaving cabinet, and a reproduction of a 16th-century guillotine, fill three floors inside. The museum also invites visitors into interactive galleries where they can try out the forensic techniques of fingerprint, DNA, and dental identification. Wannabe crime busters can also hone their skills in police car and shooting range simulators and in a mock-up CSI lab. With a stated mission to help fight crime, the museum is also becoming a resource for real investigations: It houses the television studio of John Walsh’s , where operators take calls from tipsters every Saturday night.

FRESH-AIR FLICKS
This year marks the 75th birthday of an all-American tradition: the drive-in movie. What better place to celebrate than in Pittsburgh, where you’ll find more than a dozen drive-in theaters within an hour of the city, most offering first-run flicks? Best of all, these spots are date-friendly, kid-friendly, and wallet-friendly.
Reopened last year, Twin Hi-Way is just ten miles from downtown Pittsburgh. John Butya, a second-generation owner of the theater, grew up next door to it and fondly remembers hearing Godzilla eating Tokyo from his bedroom. He says the effort to update the equipment and restore the old sign to its original 1950s glory paid off the first night they were back in business. “I got a chill. What a wonderful feeling to see a movie on that screen again.” 5588 Steubenville Pike, McKees Rocks 412.494.4999Twin Hi-Way Drive-In

Roll in to the Dependable for a snow cone, but don’t be a stranger once the summer blockbuster season is over. This aptly named theater is open year-round and attracts plenty of business through the winter months. What’s cozier than watching a movie with a blanket and a thermos full of cocoa? 500 Moon Clinton Rd., Coraopolis 412.264.7011Dependable Drive-In

This screen in the quiet farming community of Latrobe is a wholesome spot that’s ideal for tots (no R-rated movies). The only exception is October’s “haunted drive-in” horror screenings, when local ghouls haunt the grounds. Aside from the occasional smear of face paint on your windshield, it’s good clean fun. 225A Route 30 East, Latrobe 724.537.7418Hi-Way Drive-In
