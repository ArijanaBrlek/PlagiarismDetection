The Voyager Company and its nonprofit foundation are committed to providing all school children with real life learning "adventures" that build achievement levels based on national standards in reading, mathematics, science, and writing. In 1994, the company launched 11 pilot programs in Texas elementary schools with differing socioeconomic populations. Voyager offers public schools and other education providers a diverse array of curricula that incorporates theme-based, participatory, and hands-on learning. Partners in developing curricula include the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, Discovery Channel, and NASA.Safe and Smart: Making After-School Hours Work for Kids - June 1998

Voyager builds partnerships with school districts and teachers to help them deliver multi-age or grade-specific programs that improve academic performance and support social development of children. Through ongoing training by experienced specialists, teachers learn strategies to engage students in interdisciplinary projects that also involve parents and community members. Teachers also receive training in assessment of program effectiveness and student performance. Anecdotally, educators and parents say that Voyager has increased children's interest in learning, student attendance, and academic performance. Since 1994, Voyager has expanded to serve over 22,000 students in 60 school districts, some of which use Title I funding for the program. -###-
