Honors/Independent Study
If you have a deep interest and the motivation in your field of study, and you meet the standards set by the College and your major department, you have the opportunity to do an Honors Study, an in-depth research in close coordination with a faculty member.
As a junior who has maintained a 3.5 average in your major courses for the sophomore and junior years, you may at the end of the junior year request permission of your department to be admitted to Honors Study. At this time, in consultation with your major department, you'll formulate a tentative plan for a senior project that has a scope of a year-long project in your declared major.
