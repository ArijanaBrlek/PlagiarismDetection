Cutting Wedding Costs
by Rose Smith
A wedding, as we all know, can be a very expensive undertaking. Here are few ideas to help you cut your wedding costs.
Rent a Lincoln or other nice large car instead of a limousine. They provide more than enough room and at a much cheaper rate. You also have the added benefit of keeping it for at least 24 hours (or longer if you choose to do so), whereas a limousine is only rented for an hour or two at most.
If you are using real flowers in your wedding, why not try your local grocery store’s flower department? Many will create centerpieces and bouquets for weddings and at a fraction of the cost.
Don’t use real flowers in centerpieces. Use silk ones instead. They are usually lower in price, look just as nice and will stay “fresh” forever.
Make your own invitations. You can purchase very nice looking blank invitations at stationary and various craft stores. Search the net for a small poem or saying that you can use, or make up your own. Go to and sign up for their free 3 day trial and find some nice wedding graphics that you can use on your invitations (and thank you notes, wedding favor tags, etc.) ArtToday.com
In addition to the invitations, create your own wedding programs too. This can save you a ton of money.
Instead of a sit down dinner, have it catered with a buffet style set up. The food is just as delicious, the guests won’t mind getting their own plates, it costs half of what a sit-down dinner costs, and you usually get more food as an extra bonus.
