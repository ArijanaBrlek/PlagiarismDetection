Natural Gas Applications
Successful businesses recognise that minimising costs is absolutely critical. That is why more and more businesses are connecting to Natural Gas, the efficient and competitively priced fuel alternative. Connected directly to the point of use means no storage headache and eliminates the need to re-order or worry about fluctuating price of other fuels such as LPG & oil. And this means you can get on with managing your business.
Catering with Natural Gas
Most professional chefs prefer cooking with gas. From hobs, ovens, steamers to deep fat fryers, Natural Gas is chosen for its cleanliness, efficiency and economic running costs. For large scale caterers, such as hotels, the running cost of Natural Gas can be as low as one-third of alternative energy sources.
CHP systems
Combined Heat and Power, or CHP as it is more commonly referred to, is the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heat in a single process. In other words, it utilises the heat produced in electricity generation rather than wasting it.
Choosing Natural Gas heating for your Business
Natural Gas makes all the difference to the traditional form of space and water heating. The new generation of boiler design enables high operating efficiencies to be achieved over a wide range of outputs, while being smaller, quieter, lighter and designed for more flexible installation.
