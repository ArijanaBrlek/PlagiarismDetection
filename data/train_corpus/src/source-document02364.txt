Summary••
Christian author Warren Smith’s book warns about the serious New Age implications of Pastor Rick Warren’s book e.Deceived on PurposeThe Purpose Driven Lif
Smith takes the reader into the inner workings of today’s evangelical world as he explores the questionable interconnections of several of its top leaders. As Rick Warren goes worldwide with his purpose-driven Global Peace Plan, Smith presents an in-depth examination of this mega-church pastor’s spiritual agenda. He explains how Rick Warren’s Peace Plan could eventually merge with the New Age Peace Plan that is being similarly presented by key New Age leaders.
Smith contends that Crystal Cathedral Pastor and New Age sympathizer Robert Schuller has had a great influence on Rick Warren’s teachings and that Schuller’s influence can be found throughout Rick Warren’s book . Smith writes, “The more I read Robert Schuller, the more I was shocked at how so many of Rick Warren’s thoughts, ideas, references, words, terms, phrases, and quotes in seemed to be inspired by Schuller’s writings and teachings”.The Purpose-Driven LifeThe Purpose-Driven Life
Smith’s distinctive background as a former New Age follower who has converted to biblical Christianity gives him a uniquely objective perspective as both an outsider and an insider. He draws deeply from his extensive knowledge of the New Age subculture that is now being subtly woven into the Christian church by Rick Warren and other Christian leaders. Smith believes that wittingly or unwittingly, Rick Warren is walking the church into a spiritual trap.
This exceptional book is sure to appeal to a wide-ranging audience. Anyone who desires to know how the evangelical and New Age plans are moving toward “oneness” will find this book to be especially insightful. Smith’s easy-going style makes this a fast-paced read.
