How can I reduce my risk of getting Chlamydia?
Get Tested
A simple blood test can determine if you or any of your partners have Chlamydia.
Limit Number of Partners
The fewer partners you have who are known to be uninfected, the less chance you will get Chlamydia.
Don't Have Sex
Do not have sex or take part in any sexual activity with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of Chlamydia.
Protect Yourself
