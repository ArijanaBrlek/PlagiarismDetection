To make everything more thrilling, the payouts are predetermined and promoted prior the game - shown to all during the buy-ins. Blinds advance and climb higher phases to eliminate more losing players until just a single poker player is left in Sit and Go poker.
So from about 50 Sit and Go poker players we end up with a single winner. Sometimes there can be only two poker players involved. The number of players involved is decided by the casino where the Sit and Go poker tournament is being held. Actually, the game is mostly made up of 10 or less players at a table. If there are 50 contestants, then that's 10 per table of 5 tables.
So, if we join a Sit and Go poker tournament, we pay an entry about $1 and make a buy-in of $10 if it's a $10 type of a Sit and Go poker. We go at the table and face the 10 players. We are each allowed only, say, 800 poker chips to play with. The player making the bets for the blinds has to begin with low wagers, maybe $5 to $10. As the game goes on the blind bets will increase.
Games like this example would gather $100 buy-ins which would be divided among the highest three Sit and Go poker players finishing the game. The topmost winner gets $50, the second gets $30, and the third best Sit and Go poker finisher gets $20.
Sit and Go poker tournaments with 10 participants often last from 30 to 60 minutes. But with the so-called "Turbo" Sit and Go poker games, the bets on the blinds increase rapidly so that the whole game ends faster.
Sit and Go poker games are gaining popularity these days especially online because of its profitability, fast pace, and the thrill that accompanies each moment. This is where the skills are also thoroughly honed.
