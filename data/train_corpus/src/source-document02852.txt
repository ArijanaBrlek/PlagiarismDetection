Hoboken Eddie's
Chile Pepper Magazine recently chose Hoboken Eddie's Specialties of Hoboken, NJ as an official winner in their famous Fiery Food Challenge. The Challenge is one of the oldest and most prestigious contests in the world of hot and spicy food. More than 50 culinary educators, chefs and food writers chose Hoboken Eddie's sauce from hundreds of entrants. Eddie's sauce knocked their spurs off!
What's so special about Eddie's sauces? Chef Edmund Patrick "Hoboken Eddie" Mc Carthy starts with fresh, all-natural ingredients. Then he mixes them with a secret array of herbs and spices to conjure-up his mysterious, mystical sauces. There are no animal products, fats, oils, preservatives or chemicals. The sauce is completely natural. All of Chef Eddie's products are hand-filled to maintain the quality of the sauces. To automatically fill the bottles would require finer processing of ingredients, something he is not willing to do.
Chef Eddie is a master chef, certified caterer and has taught at the French Culinary Institute in New York City. He is now causing quite a stir under his assumed name "Hoboken Eddie" and he is powerful serious about his sauces. He's spent years devising and concocting his brews. When you taste 'em, you'll spend years craving 'em!
