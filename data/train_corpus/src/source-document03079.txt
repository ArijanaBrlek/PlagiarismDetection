12.5 gauge hi-tensile wire has a magical ability to blend into the landscape to the human eye. However it is respected greatly by livestock when powered up with an adequate energizer. And, at 2 cents per foot per strand, it is an economical means to contain your animals. The class III galvanized coating also ensures that it will  last 3 to 4 times longer than standard class I soft wire coatings.

Some of the Permanent Fencing Systems include:
Hi-tensile Wire System: This system is ideal for interior cattle fences, and as well for PERMANENT perimeter fences. Its the bread & butter of hi-tensile fencing and the most economical system to put up. It will also last you about the longest of ALL fencing. The number of strands that you put up will dictate what types of animals that you need to contain. Although a single strand at about 34" above ground will effectively control cattle, you may need to use up to 7 strands for certain breeds of goat or sheep. These systems are installed on PowerFlex Posts which are available in many different heights to fit your needs. This system, utilizing all insulated line posts, is a very flexible system that will not NEED a lot of attention and maintenance over time.
Pictured above is a Hi-tensile wire fence that would handle any &  all types of agricultural livestock. It has 7 strands of 12.5 gauge hi-tensile wire. The top strand is 48" above ground and the bottom wire is 6" above ground. Every other wire is electrified and the others are grounded. The line posts are 1-5/8" X 72" PowerFlex Posts. They are 50" above ground with 22" of ground penetration. This fence was designed to hold goats. It is currently being used for cattle, with with only 3 wires electrified. This is a very substantial fence and although not actually neccessary for cattle it can also be used for goats or sheep.This fence with 7 strands will most likely hold cattle even during a power outage.  (it is also a very attractive fence) In the photo, you can see that the fence line was dozed out. The trees on the other side could potentially pose a maintenance problem - however with this fence's tensile abilities it is not. Should a tree fall on this fence, you will most likely not have any repairs to make, other than getting a chain saw out to remove the tree, allowing the fence to "pop" back up.

Picture above and below is a goat operation that utilized a 7 strand HT fence at the perimeters and a 5 strand HT fence for interior fences. The exterior 7 strand used 1-5/8" x 72 Powerflex posts and the interior fences were of 1-5/8" x 66" posts. This project sits on about 600 acres with lots of interior fencing and gateways. It lays on the Big Piney River in Texas County, Missouri. They also used our Fixed Knot Hi-Tensile Woven Wire for penning and water hubs.

- A Hi-tensile Woven Wire System: Woven wire adds a dimension to fencing that addresses more secure settings and those that also offer additional predator control. These systems should be mounted on PowerFlex Posts for a maintenance free system with a high degree of security. This system may be electrified or a stand-off hot wire may be added depending on your particular livestock type and characteristics. This system with its fixed knot (shown below) has "amazing" bounce and spring to it - a trait that is not found in most woven wire products with hinged knots.Sheep & Goat "Guardian"
 
 Horse (Equine) Fencing Systems: Horses pose unique challenges for fencing, and at PowerFlex we understand the special needs of our equine friends. The Powerflex Equine Systems offers a lot of choices for conductor types including: wire, coated wire and braided ropes.These are systems that are secure but also with an added consideration of safety for your animals. Additionally they are very pleasing to the eye. Pictured below is a Powerflex Equine System with White PowerFlex Posts and HoteCote (vinyl coated hi-tensile wire)
 
Some of the Portable Fencing systems include:
Portable Grazing Systems for Strip Grazing: This system is one that is used to contain livestock on a smaller area of a paddock - to better utilize your forage. As grass and forages are harvested by livestock the "System" is moved along with the animals. It is generallly comprised of Reels, Tread-in Posts and Polybraid. And - the components can be modified or taylor made for your particular style of management. As pictured below, the components are lighweight and easy to set up or move by one person. With several reels and bundles of posts, you can pre-set up some paddocks and further speed up your animal movement time. Animals learn rather quickly that when you move fence - they are getting new grass - and are eager to move to the next paddock and fresh browse / graze.It is somewhat of a system within a system !
Portable Systems for Sheep & Goats: This system is very tight, but offers lighweight features and easy set up and moving features. Normally this system is comprised of electrified netting, polybraid or a combination of both. As pictured below, this polynetting can is normally in 165' rolls and can easily be moved and erected by one person. Multiple rolls can be joined together with the snap of a plug. To make an easy corner or gateway - a PowerFlex Post driven into the ground works great.

TheConceptof a Powerflex Fence System
By Gary A. Duncan
Sometimes a new concept is hard to grasp  especially, after generations of basic ideals have been pounded into our heads. Most of us that grew up in agriculture in the past 50 or so years probably began our fencing endeavors at an early age. We were taught the so called rights and wrongs of barbed or woven wire fencing by our fathers and grandfathers. Bigger, tighter, the more rigid the better  was the status quo. We built fortresses for fences. And, rightly so with a fence that would be considered a physical barrier.  The problem always was and still is this: It is expensive to build such a strong fortress of a fence  but the most costly part of it all is maintaining it as such over the years. We generally dont keep track of materials and time spent fixin fence . We just assume that it goes along with raising livestock  but it does cost us more than we will admit in time and dollars.
Then along came the electric fence which provided livestock control potential based upon the idea of a physiological barrier rather than a physical one. About 20 years ago the hi-tensile electric fence was introduced. But first lets look at the history, evolution and concept of the electric fence.
[The concept of the electric fence was first described in Mark Twain 's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court , in 1889, as a defensive weapon. Electric fences were used to control livestock in the United States in the early 1930s, and electric fencing technology developed in both the United States and New Zealand .  An early application of the electric fence was developed in 19361937 by New Zealand inventor William "Bill" Gallagher Sr. Built from a car's ignition coil and a meccano set, Gallagher used the device to keep his horse from scratching itself against his car. Gallagher later started a company to improve and market the design. In 1962, another New Zealand inventor, Doug Phillips, invented the non-short-able electric fence based on capacitor discharge. This significantly increased the range an electric fence could be used from a few hundred yards to 35 miles, and reduced the cost of fencing by more than 80%. The non-short-able electric fence was patented by Phillips and by 1964 was manufactured by Plastic Products, a New Zealand firm, under the name "Waikato Electric Fence. This idea was a major contributing factor enabling New Zealand to become a world leader in efficient pastoral farming. This non-short-able design has been improved upon (from high impedance to the newer low impedance) over the years and is the system that is now used on farms throughout the world today.  Introduction of high tensile (HT) steel fence wire took place in the 1970s in New Zealand and in the 1980s in the United States.]
(Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_fence )
So, in summary of the above: the first electric fences were introduced into the US in about the 1930s. But, the introduction of the modern pulsing energizers didnt take place until 1964. High tensile wire wasnt introduced into the US until the 1980s. I put up my first 12.5 gauge HT fence in about 1988 and dont recall much widespread use of HT fencing until the 1990s. Hey, this is pretty new stuff for us in North America!
Up until the 1980s we didnt have much choice for electric fence wire. Mostly what was used was the 14 to 18 gauge soft wire that, at the time, we called electric fence wire.  It came on those little spools. After using that type of wire, lots of people got a bad taste in their mouth about electric fencing. It broke easily and I am sure I am not the only one who ever got a quarter mile of it wrapped around the blades of a brush hog. It was hung on steel  t-posts or those little rebar posts. Those flimsy yellow insulators broke easily and bingo you had a short and your livestock may have gotten out.  It was a constant battle keeping power on your fence, when the fence was up. I still get comments from the ol timers such as: Yep, I tried that lectric fence 20 years ago and it just didnt work for me.   Well, ol bud  there have been a lot of advancements in the past 20 years. Weve learned a lot.
Modern day hi-tensile wire is 12.5 gauge with 170,000 psi or more which equals a breaking strength of 1000 to 1500 pounds. It is a class III galvanized (or better) and it lasts a very long time. It also has very little resistance for the electric pulse to flow down its length.
Due to our barbed wire and steel t-post roots, we initially started putting our hi-tensile electric fence wire on rigid steel t-posts, because that is what we had been using in the past for all our other fences. They were available at every farm store in the country and still are. We couldnt swallow the idea of spacing our line posts at 40 or 50 foot spacing, so we shrunk them down some - just to make us feel better. What we did was to try to make our hi-tensile electric fence more similar to our old barbed wire fences  rigid.
Then, along came fiberglass posts and a variety of recycled plastic wanna-be fence posts.  Fiberglass, at the time, was a great improvement over the other alternatives, but they also have a few concerns for me. They do not necessarily hold the ground very well and tend to pull out rather easily, due to their slick smooth surfaces. They also tend to get a little splintery over the years and they are hard to handle and to drill.
Ok, thats enough on the history and evolution of electric fencing; now, lets get to the CONCEPT and the guts of this article. For some, to grasp this it may be similar to the introduction of barbed wire into the open range country of the west.  Lets talk about hi-tensile (HT) wire first. A 180,000 minimum psi HT wire will have a breaking strength of around 1350 pounds. It will stretch up to about 2% of its initial tension  but, after this 2% stretch, it will return to its initial tension. Now that may not sound like much, but in a quarter of a mile (1320) that equates to 27 feet. Wow. This wire is springy and bouncy. It only needs to be tensioned up to 150 to 250 pounds. I think Springy and Bouncy is a good trait for an electric fence wire. We need to allow it to be springy and bouncy. But, we often tend to do just the opposite by attaching it to rigid line posts and not allowing it to move with pressure as it is intended to. To allow this we need a line post that has flexibility and will move with the wire when need be, while maintaining an upright position and returning to its initial position, the rest of the time. The Powerflex Post does just that  it allows the HT wire to move. These posts also have great ground holding ability, with few lift outs. We feel that this ground holding ability is due to the texture of the posts as well as the possibility that the post expands a little bit as it is driven. Were not talking rocket science here, we are talking about a line post for HT electric fence.
Jim Gerrish published an article last year in the Stockman GrassFarmer magazine in his column: Grassroots of Grazing. The title was [When fencing with wildlife in the neighborhood, think flexible not fortress.]  now I love the way those 3 words flow off my tongue. Its a Concept. Here is an excerpt from Jims article. If you want a copy of this article, in its entirety, let me know. This excerpt picks up after descriptions of the wildlife (big game) activity in a pivot grazing system in Idaho...Flexible not Fortress
[Step one was to reduce the number of wires used and put them at heights that allow elk to flow over the top and antelope to pass underneath. Our perimeter fences are now just two wires set at 20 and 30 inches. The elk brush over with their legs and the antelope dive underneath without any problem. We still have some fences to change over but we are highly motivated to get it done because of the dramatic reduction in maintenance needs we have experienced with the new design. What about the cattle? If they wont stay in a 30" hot wire, theyre hamburger.
Next item of business was to not put up any hi-tensile wire less than 180,000 psi rating, which has a breaking strength over 1500 lb and will stand up to our biggest elk and moose. Where we left the old 130,000 psi wire up we still have some breakage to contend with. The ranch manager has become convinced not to try to reuse the old wire we have taken down. Buying new wire is worth more to him from the reduced maintenance requirement compared to the money saved by reusing old wire.
We have also quit using the fiberglass line posts and gone to the new PowerFlex wood-plastic composite (WPC) post. The 1 1/8" PowerFlex posts have much more flexibility than even fiberglass and are very difficult to pull out of the ground. What we have found on these WPC posts is they have a textured surface and expand a little when driven into the ground. At a recent grazing school here in Idaho, I bet a strapping young man in his early 20's $25 that he couldnt pull out a post I had just driven 16" in the ground. He tried bending, twisting, and tugging and didnt budge it at all. They pulled it out later with the backhoe! On the fences we have left fiberglass posts in, the wildlife are still pulling them out of the ground and we have to keep driving them back in. We have only had a couple of the WPC post pulled out in a little over a year that we have had them in place.
 What difference have these changes made in our relationship to the local wildlife and our maintenance activities? We still see all the creatures moving back and forth across the pivots so we havent impeded their flow.  In spring of 2005, I had patched 30 to 40 breaks in the old hi-tensile wire and pounded 20 to 30 fiberglass posts back in the ground. In spring of 2006 after changing over the fence design in summer 2005, I patched one break in the fence and that was where a tension spring had pulled apart, not where a wire had broken. I never like tension springs anyway. I drove two WPC posts back in and the usual 20+ fiberglass posts. Building fence with wildlife in mind clearly makes ranching in the West an easier proposition. Remember, think flexibility, not fortress! ]
I think that about hits the nail on the head. I remember receiving a 12 sample of a composite rod material over 4 years ago. It was pretty rigid in that length and it layed on my desk for months. We had seen all sorts of recycled post products that had all fallen short of expectations in the past. I finally took an interest in it and got a longer sample. Wow&∈ a longer (post size) length it had a springy flexibility. It was unique to anything we had ever seen before. David and I drove some into the ground. We beat them up, abused them and did all kinds of unnatural things to them. There is plenty of information about the Powerflex Posts on our website ( www.powerflexfence.com ) so I wont expand on their technical data here&&.they are just incredibility tough, durable and very flexible. They serve their purpose as a line post for HT electric fence extremely well. They are a natural fit with HT wire.
The CONCEPT is very simple:  An insulated line post that supports and maintains wire spacing on an electrified HT wire or net. But, when challenged by outside forces of nature, wildlife or ag equipment  it is very forgiving and flexible. A POWERFLEX SYSTEM performs admirably well for us - is easy to handle and work with  and ensures over its lifetime.less maintenance
