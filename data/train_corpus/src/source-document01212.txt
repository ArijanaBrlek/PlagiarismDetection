Homemaking
About Blog
This Blog is for EVERYONE! It was created for You and Me, to help us become better Homemakers! Here's how it works...you create a "post" for everyone to see. (Posts will be deleted if inappropriate!) Then people can make comments (or give answers) about that post. The idea of this blog is to offer advice, ideas, ask questions, etc. that will help you and others become better homemakers. By setting it up this way people don't have to be embarrassed to ask simple or complicated questions and can ask for advice without feeling like they should have already known "that."
