Private Property, Taxation, & The State
Conference Description and Confirmed Participants
This conference was prompted by the appearance of two books arguing against an austere classical liberalism and in support of an expansive state role in superintending property holdings: Stephen Holmes & Cass Sunstein, ; and Liam Murphy & Thomas Nagel, . Not least notable about these works is that libertarianism is the primary foil for each. Not since the dotage of Herbert Spencer has welfare liberalism taken its main opposition to come from this direction. Are we in the midst of a sea change in political philosophy? And yet more to the point: Which side has the better of the argument? Such will be the kinds of questions taken up at this conference.
