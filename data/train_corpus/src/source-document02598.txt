Redevelopment of the Church of the Holy Innocents Site
"On Safe Ground?" . All Saints Episcopal Parish owns the Church of the Holy Innocentsâ€™ site which consists of three National Register historic structures on 6th Street located on Willow and Clinton. For many years, All Saints has worked on a redevelopment plan for that site. Unfortunately, several major questions linger: Will the two buildings that are to remain in place survive the demolition of the center building and the construction of a nine story tower that is to house three floors of a school and 45 to 50 residential units? What are the risks to the integrity of the remaining buildings, and can those risks be mitigated? Read the QLC's position on redevelopment of the Church of the Holy Innocents Site
