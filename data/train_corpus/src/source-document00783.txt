What is the Nissan Titan Tonneau Cover?
The Nissan Titan Tonneau Cover is the next generation of that you normally see. It's a hard tonneau cover NOT made of plastic or fiberglass... It's made of metal, just like the body panels on most trucks. Each truck bed cover is cut using a 4000 watt precision laser for a perfect fit on your truck.truck bed covers
