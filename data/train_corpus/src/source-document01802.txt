History and Background
The is a partnership among the Nile riparian states that seeks to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share substantial socioeconomic benefits, and promote regional peace and security . The NBI began with a participatory process of dialogue among the riparian states that resulted in an agreement on a shared vision to achieve sustainable socioeconomic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources.Nile Basin Initiative (NBI)
It was formally launched in February, 1999 by the water ministers of 9 countries that share the river - Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia,Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda as well as Eritrea. Eritrea, which shares only a very small portion of the Nile Basin, is not participating actively in the Initiative it assumes an observer role.
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is led by the riparian states of the Nile River through the Council of Ministers of Water Affairs of the Nile Basin states (Nile Council of Ministers, or Nile-COM).
Recognizing that cooperative development holds the greatest prospects for bringing benefits to the entire region, and aware of the challenges - the initiative provides an institutional mechanism, a shared vision, and a set of agreed policy guidelines to provide a basinwide framework for cooperative action. The policy guidelines define the following as the primary objectives of the NBI:
To develop the Nile Basin water resources in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure
prosperity, security, and peace for all its peoples
To ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the resources
To ensure cooperation and joint action between the riparian countries, seeking win-win gains
To target poverty eradication and promote economic integration
To ensure that the program results in a move from planning to action.
The Strategic Action Program represents the Nile riparians strategic approach to achieving sustainable socioeconomic development in the basin through equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. The Strategic Action Program provides the means for translating this shared vision into concrete activities through a two-fold, complementary approach:
Lay the groundwork for cooperative action through a regional program to build confidence and capacity throughout the basin (the Shared Vision Program)
Pursue, simultaneously, cooperative development opportunities to realize physical investments and tangible results through sub-basin activities (Subsidiary action programs) in the Eastern Nile and the Nile Equatorial Lakes regions.
The Nile Basin Initiative is supported by contributions from the NBI countries themselves and through the support of international financial institutions - such as the World Bank, the Global Environmental Facility, and the - and other donors. In 2003 a World Bankmanaged, multi-donor trust fund was created to harmonize donor contributions. African Devlopment Bank (AfDB)
