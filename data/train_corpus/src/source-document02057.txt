How destructive can tornadoes be?
What is a tornado?
A tornado is a rapidly spinning column of air that develops in association with severe thunderstorms. It can vary in size from only a few metres to over 1,000 metres in diameter and its track may be from a few hundred metres to more than 100 kilometres. It can last from only a few minutes to an hour or more.
Inside the air column, there is a very powerful updraught which causes very low atmospheric pressure at the surface. Immediately outside the column, winds are rotating (anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere, clockwise in the southern) at speeds that can be higher than 90 metres per second (200 miles per hour).
