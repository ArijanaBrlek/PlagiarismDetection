SAT Preparation Course
Strategy Coaching
You will learn: how SAT questions vary in difficulty; how to look for "traps"; when not to answer; what to leave blank; how to pace yourself throughout the exam; and, finally, how to discern the best answer through a process of elimination.
Diagnostic & Practice Testing
You will be given diagnostic SAT pre-tests in the first class session.  Your strengths and weaknesses will be evaluated as an important first step in identifying areas for improvement.  SAT post-tests, administered in the last class session, will be used as a final measure of gain.  Throughout the course, you will practice on timed SAT tests.
Small Classes
Our classes comprise four to 12 students, thus, allowing instructors to develop your hidden strengths and eliminate your weaknesses.
Expected Improvement
Many students who have attended all classes and fulfilled all homework requirements have raised combined math and verbal scores by as many as 300 points or more on the post-test.
Computer Use
Students in our SAT prep program have access to our computers and to test preparation software designed to reinforce their test-taking skills.  This software includes computer-based testing.

We have two convenient locations: At Dupont Circle in downtown Washington, DC within walking distance to the Metro or in Gaithersburg, MD within walking distance of the MARC station.
