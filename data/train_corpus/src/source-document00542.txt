Westcoast Mountain Campers rents a wide range of quality campers, motorhomes, vanconversions, caravans, recreational vehicles, rvs and  truck campers in Calgary, Alberta and Vancouver, British Columbia.  A circle trip of the west coast including Vancouver Island and  leading up to the Olympic Village at Whistler BC are some of the most scenic wilderness adventures for holiday in a motorhome or truck/camper. Campervans and the Alberta Rockies are a great combination for summer getaways.  Camper and motorhome rentals are a very popular way to explore the Okanagan Valley, the Cariboo, the East and West Kootnay regions on your way to the Canadian Rockies in BC and Alberta Canada.
