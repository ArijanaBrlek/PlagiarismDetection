Paella
Probably the most famous Spanish dish outside of Spain, paella is a rich saffron rice with a variety of meat pieces, seafood and vegetables. It's believed that the word 'paella' derives from the Arabic word , which means leftovers. According to a legend, the dish was created by servants of Moorish kings, who were allowed to take mixed leftovers from the courtly feasts home in large pots. Many kinds of paella are popular around the country, but the original recipe is believed to have been developed in Valencia. The inhabitants of this city make paella their main meal on Sunday. Heat 1/4-1/2 cup of the oil in a large pan and add the pieces of pepper. Fry until pepper starts to soften, then remove and leave to garnish the dish. At medium heat fry the rabbit and chicken. Add the paprika to add more colour. Push the pieces of meat out to the edges of the pan and put in the tomatoes and beans in the middle, mixing them well. Pour 1/2 of the water and cover the pan. Simmer all ingredients for approximately half hour until most of the water evaporate. Then add the rice, fry for a few minutes, mixing with meat and vegetables. Pour the rest of the water into the pan and cook for 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper as well as some saffron for colour. Once the is seasoned, it be left for 2 minutes at medium-high heat without stirring, until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelise. Garnish the dish with the strips of red pepper and sprinkle with of rosemary, if you like. Cover the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.baqiyah
