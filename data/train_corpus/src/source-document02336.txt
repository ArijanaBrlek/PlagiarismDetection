What We Do
Child Support Audits and Record Management Program (CSARMP) is a unique program designed to help protect obligor parents (those parents who owe child and/or spousal support) from paying more in back child support (arrears) than legally required. This highly effective program has assisted thousands of subscribers successfully challenge arrears by tracking their court order and payment history, and producing  accurate records of payments, accrued interest, and monthly posting sequences that comport with the applicable law of the state that has jurisdiction over the case.  
CSARMP also provides subscribers with the tools to accurately track their visitation or shared custody percentage. The calendar program has assisted countless subscibers in reducing their child support orders by proving increased shared custody. An accurate calendar that refllects accurate visitation/shared custody percentages is essential evidence in a child support court proceeding. 
After subscribing to CSARMP, proceed to the View General Instruction pulldown menu for steps on how to setup your audit and calendar. Once you complete the easy setup, you are ready to maintain accurate records of support obligations and shared custody.  The success of your child support and custody/visitation matters will depend, in large part,  on the accuracy of the records you create and manage.
