Holiday Mini Catalogues
Anyone have the CDN Item Number for the Holiday Mini Catalogues? They are available as of October 1st, right?

When you order them.. click on the msgnifying glass and the whole list of supplies will appear.. scroll down until you see holiday mini cats.. click on it and it will add to your list of supplies you are ordering. The # is also in CN.. Yes, you can order tham after Oct 1.. I ordered mine Monday. Holiday cats are ready to order Nov 1st.
