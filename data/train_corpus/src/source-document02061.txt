: UNDERGRADUATE
If you are an undergraduate student with no previous college credit, or if you are a non degree seeking student, we will not need any transcripts.
If you are an undergraduate student with previous college credit and you have not earned a Bachelors degree or above yet, we do need official transcripts sent from all previous institutions and a TCE Application for transfer credit review. If the course work was completed at an institution not accredited by a US recognized body, you will need to have a degree verification evaluation completed by an international education agency. Please email for more information. international@apus.edu
GRADUATE:
If you are a graduate student, we still need an official transcript of your Bachelors or higher degree conferred.  If the degree was conferred by an institution not accredited by a US recognized body, you will need to have a degree verification evaluation completed by an international education agency. Please email for more information. international@apus.edu
