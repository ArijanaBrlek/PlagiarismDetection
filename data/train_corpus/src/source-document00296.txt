David Woodward was born in 1942 in Royal Leamington Spa, England. After receiving a bachelor degree from the University of Wales, Swansea, he came to the United States to study cartography under Arthur H. Robinson at UW–Madison, where he earned a doctorate in geography in 1970. David spent the next eleven years at the Newberry Library in Chicago as cartographic specialist, curator of maps, and, from 1974 to 1980, director of its Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography. In 1980 David joined the faculty of UW–Madison Geography Department and was named Arthur H. Robinson Professor of Geography in 1995. He retired from teaching in August 2002 to dedicate more of his time to research, editing, and outreach.
During a 1977 walk through the countryside in Exeter, England, David Woodward and J. Brian Harley (UW–Milwaukee) developed the idea for what became . They envisioned an ambitious multi-volume reference work that would examine the social production and consumption of maps across cultures from prehistoric origins to the twentieth century. When Harley died unexpectedly in 1991, David continued the Project, knowing that his friend and colleague influence would always be felt.The History of Cartography
David skillfully balanced his work on the History of Cartography Project with his other scholarly endeavors and academic responsibilities. In addition to the many awards garnered by the published volumes of (follow links at for more information about each individual volume), David international reputation was acknowledged closer to home. He was honored to receive a five-year senior membership at the UW Institute for Research in the Humanities, the UW–Madison Hilldale award in the arts and humanities, and the College of Letters and Sciences Career Service Award, among many other distinctions. He gave hundreds of public lectures, discussing and developing new ideas with others as well as disseminating his research.The History of Cartography www.geography.wisc.edu/histcart/series.html
David was a prolific and well-regarded scholar; his individual research and editorial works were widely disseminated and highly acclaimed. Among David numerous publications are: (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977); (Florence: Leo S. Olschki, 1996); (The 1995 Panizzi Lectures) (London: British Library, 1996); (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996), with Robert C. Ostergren, Onno Brouwer, Steven Hoelscher, and Joshua G. Hane; and (Barcelona: Institut Cartogric de Catalunya, 2001), with Catherine Delano Smith and Cordell Yee.The All-American Map: Wax-Engraving and Its Influence on CartographyCatalogue of Watermarks in Italian Maps, ca. 1540-1600Maps as Prints in the Italian Renaissance: Makers, Distributors & ConsumersCultural Map of Wisconsin: A Cartographic Portrait of the StateApproaches and Challenges in a Worldwide History of Cartography
In spite of his many accomplishments, David was an unassuming man. As one friend simply wrote: e was by far one of the nicest and most genuine people I have ever met. He had a great presence—and a great laugh. He will be missed dearly.

"Windows on the World: A Selection of Historical Maps"
"Windows on the World" was an exhibit at the University of Wisconsin Department of Special Collections that was launched on the occasion of the 24th annual Institute for Research in the Humanities Burdick-Vary symposium on Cartography in the European Renaissance (6-8 April 2000). The symposium was intended as a forum for issues arising out of the research for Volume Three of the History of Cartography Project. "Windows on the World" reveals to the general public and university community some of the many historical map resources currently available in University of Wisconsin library collections. These cartographic treasures are often overlooked, embedded as they are in a huge library system that must respond to dozens of demanding undergraduate and graduate programs. We hope that this exhibit reminds not only scholars in the history of cartography and the historical geography of the Midwest but the general public as well of these rich primary collections.
