ALL-TERRAIN
The Ultimate Off-Road Tyre for freedom and mobility off the road offering excellent on-road manners and long wear life.
The casing is of 'TriGard' construction 3 polyester layers which is extremely strong and resistant to damage. The tread has been designed to pull your vehicle through the very worst of off-road conditions, including mud, rock, snow and sand. On the road the level of comfort and handling behaviour is remarkable for such an aggressively treaded tyre designed primarily for off-road use.
have been selling and using these tyres for 16 years, and without doubt they are the best all-round tyre for vehicles using the same tyre for on-road and off-road use. In some cases we have experienced 35-75,000 miles of wear from these BFGoodrich tyres proving they really are an excellent value for money investment for the serious off-roader.
