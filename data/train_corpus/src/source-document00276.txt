Chef Patrick Clark - When the Clintons were looking for a new chef for the White House, they set their sights on Patrick Clark, chef at the historic Hay Adams Hotel across Lafayette Square.

The chief executive's choice for top chef was not the only honor conferred on Clark. Among other distinctions, he won the James Beard Foundation award for "Best Chef, Mid-Atlantic Region." But what most distinguished Patrick Clark was his bright personality and warm affection, personal qualities that built such strong bonds with his customers that when he died, while waiting for a heart transplant, in February 1998.
