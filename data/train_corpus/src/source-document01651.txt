With this in mind, we put the impact protection on the outside, not on the inside. Like a turtle's shell this innovative design has made TURTLES the product of choice. That is why Imation, BASF and others distribute Turtles products under their labels. They know that they can trust Turtles to protect their valuable products and the even more important information those tapes contain. Secondly, the high-density polyethylene will never deteriorate or biodegrade. The airspace trapped inside the double-walls offer temperature insulation, feature single wall media do not. We now are adding a new mixture of special resin to make TURTLES conductive.
