The Choice of Hunters, Animal Trainers and Outdoor Enthusiasts.
Territorial deception scentsUsing predator urines to influence the movement of other animals in the wild has been an effective technique for hundreds of years. All animals are born with an instinctive fear of their predators. Their keen sense of smell is an early warning device to alert them to danger. Playing on the survival instinct of all creatures to avoid natural predators  or seek out their own kind  has helped hunters and trappers lure animals to their locations, and naturalists and conservationists to study and observe creatures in the wild.
100% Predator Urine Products
Predator urine is not a pesticidal repellent
 
How it works
Leg Up Enterprises uses only 100% pure, predator urines as deception scents. By simulating the marking technique of a chosen predator, designated areas will carry a scent. Simply place markers  our convenient 30-day dispensers or scent darts  every ten to twelve feet around a perimeter.
 
 
Predator urines are safe for the animals they are taken from as well! All urines are collected naturally from domestically raised animals on farms that are controlled by appropriate state and federal agencies.Is it safe?
