Try downloading Boot Camp and burning the driver disc. It contains Windows XP drivers for all the Apple keyboards and mice, and it should work for using your gear on Windows.

Do I need Intel based mac computer for doing that? Or is that somehow possible to burn the driver cd with old not intel Mac?

Yes, and the windows machine must be able to support bluetooth.

Given the fact that windows supports every Apple USB keyboard & mouse... I am guessing it's a bluetooth issue unless told otherwise

The only thing about Boot Camp is that it will install a custom graphics driver (and possibly other stuff) that only applies to Intel Macs; not generic PCs.Â  You should reinstall your correct graphics driver after you install the Boot Camp drivers.

Last I checked the bootcamp drivers checked to make sure it was an Intel-mac, and didn't install if it wasn't. My PC didn't work too great with bluetooth, so I had luck plugging the bluetooth dongle into my mac, pairing my keyboard, then putting the dongle in the PC. But you should be able to pair just fine if your PC works with other bluetooth devices.
