About Us
Hello and welcome!
My name is Jennifer Thoden and I am a writer and publisher of "how-to" information products specific to the sewing and crafts community.
I love writing and sharing ideas as much as sewing my own draperies and home decor.
My background in interior design helps me guide my customers in the direction they wish to go with their latest project.
I hope that you enjoy the articles on my web site. Please don't hesitate to contact me with ideas, suggestions... or to submit an article of your own.
If you love sewing window treatments, you would love "" and "". These are my 2 most popular publications to date. They have detailed step-by-step illustrated instructions that anyone can understand. How To Make Roman Shades How To Sew Pleated Drapes
So... read, enjoy and happy sewing!
