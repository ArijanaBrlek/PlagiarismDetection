Cookies: 1 cup margarine 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon molasses 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 eggs 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon 1 1/2 cups 1-minute Quaker Oats Creme filling 2 teaspoons very hot water 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups (7 ounce jar) Marshmallow Creme 1/2 cup shortening 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream together margarine, sugars, molasses, vanilla extract and eggs. In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon. Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. Mix in the oats. Drop dough by tablespoonsful onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes, or until cookies are just starting to darken around the edges. They will still appear moist in the center. Be careful not to overbake - when cooled, the cookies should be soft and chewy. While the cookies bake, prepare the filling. Use a small bowl to dissolve the salt in 2 teaspoons of very hot water; set aside to cool. Combine the Marshmallow Creme, shortening, confectioners sugar' and vanilla extract in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add the cooled salt solution to the filling mixture and combine with the mixer. Assemble each creme pie by spreading the filling over one side of a cookie, (the flat side) and press another cookie on top, making a sandwich. Repeat for the remaining cookies and filling. Makes 2 dozen creme pies.
