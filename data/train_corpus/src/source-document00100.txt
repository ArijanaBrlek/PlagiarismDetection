What do I do with the old keyboards when I purchase TACTUS?
TACTUS is both a training device and an enabling device. With TACTUS the student will learn to touch keyboard much faster than a standard keyboard. Speed and accuracy will decline when the student uses a standard keyboard. Over time, this decline becomes less noticeable as the fingers of the hand get trained to travel a specific distance to each key. There is no catch. TACTUS is so revolutionary that unless you touch and use it, even once, you will not be able to appreciate its benefit. Therefore we offer a complimentary keyboard to any teacher in a position to order more for the school. We are confident that you will be so happy with the keyboard that you will want to order them for your school. Speed and accuracy will decline when the student uses a standard keyboard. However, depending on how long the student has been using TACTUS, this decline will be less noticeable because the fingers of the hand get trained to travel a specific distance to each key. TACTUS can be used as a standard QWERTY keyboard. However, the ridges on the TACTUS keys make TACTUS suitable for use at an even younger age. This is particularly useful for those teachers who believe that children should start learning touch keyboarding before they are exposed to an application. No. According to most teachers, the earliest age for elementary school children to receive touch keyboarding tuition is 8 years. Prior to that, children do not have the psychomotorial maturity required to learn touch keyboarding. Assuming, for the moment, this to be true, at age 8, the fingers can reach all keys of the standard keyboard with the exception (perhaps) of the numerical row, that is the row above the QWERTY row (see the postscript for more information about this point). This has been verified by a researcher at the University of Michigan who is about to start a study with the TACTUS keyboard with elementary school children of 8 years of age. A similar verification was carried out at a school in Australia where another study with the TACTUS keyboard with children of 8 years of age was conducted in September-December 2001. A smaller keyboard would also create another issue. If the child learns to touch keyboard on a smaller keyboard, the child will then have to "retrain" the fingers on a regular keyboard later on. The reason for this is that touch keyboarding works on the principle of training the muscles of each finger to travel a precise distance to reach each key. If the fingers get trained on a smaller keyboard, they will need to be retrained on a bigger keyboard later. In summary therefore, if children need to be at least 8 years of age before they can be taught touch keyboarding, then the size of the keyboard does not matter and, on the other hand, having a keyboard of the same size that the child will use in high school, is very valuable. Yes. We have not received a single complaint that TACTUS has not met or exceeded expectations. However, in the unlikely event of this being the case, we offer an Please check the for pricing and freight information. No. TACTUS will work with any touch keyboarding program. Students will learn faster however if they learn the position of the alphabetical keys before they start on the touch typing program. . Unfortunately, the old keyboards have very little value. However, if your computer system is less than two years old, you will receive an additional discount when you purchase TACTUS. Is Tactus a Training Device or an Enabling Device?
