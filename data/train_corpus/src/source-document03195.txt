[] edit "Light"
In 2004, Starbucks created a "Light" version. The Light version of the Coffee Frappuccino has 54% of the calories, 15% of the fat (0.5g vs 3g), and 52% of the carbohydrates of the original. This version is prepared the same way as the original but uses a modified flavoring mix with less fat and as a sweetener. [3] Splenda
[] edit Decaf
Starbucks also served decaffeinated versions of the coffee-based frappuccinos, which, like all decaffeinated coffees, contain small amounts of caffeine. Unlike the regular coffee-based frappuccino, the decaf coffee base was made with freshly brewed decaf coffee and tasted distinctly different from the regular coffee base, which uses powdered coffee base.
Due to extra preparation involved and low demand, decaf frappuccinos were not offered at all Starbucks locations.
As of 2008, Decaffeinated Frappuccinos are no longer offered. As a replacement of sorts, customers are encouraged to add a shot of Decaffeinated Espresso to any Cr me Frappuccino.
[] edit Cr me
Alternatively, coffee-free "cream" base (what Starbucks calls Cr me Beverage Base or CBB) was created to make the popular Cr mes. This version is made by combining one part skim milk with one part CBB Powdered Mix (normally containing sugar, flavorings, thickeners and other minor proprietary ingredients). The CBB mix replaced a similar mixture called UBB, or Universal Beverage Base, in 2006. The most notable change between the two is that the newer CBB mixture does not require a "settling period" in which the CBB/milk combination would need to be chilled for a period of time to settle and thicken. Unlike the coffee version, flavoring of some sort is almost always added before consuming. Liquid or powdered tea is also used in some versions prepared at retail locations, most of the time making the "Tea Blended Cr me".
[] edit Available Versions
The following is a list of the typical versions available of each type of drink.

[] edit Modifications
As the varieties of drinks listed above show, many drinks include additional ingredients, which can include shots, flavored syrups, "" cubes, and flavored powders. Frappuccinos can also be double blended, or made with more or less ice. If ordered in a Starbucks retail location, whipped cream is no longer added by default on all Frappuccinos.

Any drink can have an additional syrup/espresso or many other flavorings added at request for a small additional charge. espresso chocolate chip
Yet another modification, though less popular, is to order the Frappuccino . The Italian word "affogato" translates to "drowned" in English. An affogato Frappuccino has a shot of espresso on top rather than blended into the rest of the drink. The most common versions of this variation are known as "caramel affogato" and "mocha affogato" style, in which the espresso shot is poured on top of a crosshatch pattern of either caramel or mocha sauce in place of whipped cream."affogato style"
