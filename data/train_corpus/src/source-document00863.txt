Meetings
Reviews and Appraisals
Safety services or appraisals are provided at the request of Member States as a means of applying the IAEA safety standards. Hence, the scope of the services or appraisals is directly related to the areas addressed by the safety standards, i.e. governmental organization, research reactors, operation, design and siting of nuclear power plants, radiation, waste and transport safety.
Effective implementation of these Standards is essential for ensuring a high level of safety, therefore the Agency must also appraise the compliance of Member States with these Standards to ensure the Standards are being applied.
The services and appraisals provided by the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security are carried out whenever there is a request from the Member State.
