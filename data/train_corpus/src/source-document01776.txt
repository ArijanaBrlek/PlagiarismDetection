In a medium mixing bowl combine the cheese, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper.
-
Cover and chill until firm.
-
Cut an "X' in the top of each filet almost but not quite all the way through.
-
Open the "X" and stuff with 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture, pushing the cheese in well until level with the top of the steaks.
-
Cover and chill 15 minutes.
To Make the Bordelaise Sauce
-
Combine the wine, thyme, and shallots in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
-
Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to 1/4 cup.
-
Add the stock and continue to simmer until reduced by half.
-
Remove the pan from the heat and reserve.
To Cook the Steaks
Preheat the oven to 400 F, and remove the steaks from the refrigerator.
-
Place a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, and heat until almost smoking.
-
Add the steaks, cut-side down, and sear 1 to 2 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a spatula.
-
Make sure to scrape up the cheese crust with the steak when turning.
-
Remove the steaks from the saute pan to a sheet pan and place in the oven to finish.
-
Cook to desired temperature, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare.
-
While the steaks are finishing in the oven, finish the sauce.
-
Return the sauce to a low heat and gradually whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, until the sauce is glossy.
-
Put a steak on each serving plate and surround the steaks with the sauce.
