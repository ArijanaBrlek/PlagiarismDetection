Coffee unplugged. The best brewing in the world of coffee happens without electricity  in a press pot. Designed just for Starbucks, this signature Coffee Press has a sturdy and gleaming stainless steel structure. This 8-cup press brews 32-ounces of coffee. Just add water, right off the boil, to the freshly ground beans and let it steep for four minutes  then, press down the plunger. Savor the rich results of brewing with a coffee press. Because this brewing method uses only a fine mesh filter instead of the traditional paper variety, the flavor-filled aromatic oils of your favorite beans are left intact. And when nothing comes between you and your coffee, you get a connoisseurs tasting experience every time. Brewing in a Coffee Press: 1. Add into the coffee press the correct amount of coarsely ground coffee.      A 8-cup (32-fl. oz.) press holds 10-2/3 tbsp. of coarse ground coffee. 2. Add 32-fl. oz. of water right off the boil into the coffee press and stir to make sure all the grounds are wet. 3. Place the plunger assembly loosely on top to hold in the heat. 4. Using a timer, steep for four minutes. 5. Pointing the pouring spout away from you and holding the pot by the handle, slowly press the plunger down with your other hand to push the grounds to the bottom of the pot. 6. Serve immediately, as the coffee maintains its superior taste for only 20 minutes. Set a timer for 20 minutes if all of the coffee will not be consumed immediately.
