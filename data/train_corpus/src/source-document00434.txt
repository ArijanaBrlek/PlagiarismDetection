For more than sixty five years, countless thousands of visitors have come to Trona during the second weekend in October for the
annual .  And each year more collectors converge for the 36 hours of frantic, non-stop activity to collect some of theGem-O-Rama
best and most desirable evaporite mineral specimens in the world.
Since the first show, the Searles Lake Gem and Mineral Society has worked closely with the management and employees of the
owner/operator on Searles Lake to provide one of the most exciting mineral collecting fieldtrips available in the world.  These
field trips and your experiences would be impossible without their co-operation, dedicationand vision.
 If you visit Trona this year, please take time afterwards to write a short note of appreciation to Searles Valley Minerals. Your letters
will help ensure that this opportunity remains available for others. SVMC's address is:
