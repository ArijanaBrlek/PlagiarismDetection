My parents first started with the Rocky when they were married in 1937 and continued to get it until their death. I started in 1964 when I got married and still get it. I love the size of it, its got good articles and very good columists. They have good articles,much better than the Post. If the Rocky were to close I probably wouldn’t suscribe to another paper. Why would I ,the best,the Rocky was gone.So please think of us, the subscribers, and keep the Rocky going. Put the Post on line,and keep the Rocky as a paper. It is easier for us older folks to read a paper then to try to read on the computer. Thank you Bj Curneen

As a publisher of a small weekly newspaper in Colorado, I’d hate to see Denver become a one-newspaper town. I’ve always liked the Rocky’s coverage of statewide issues, education, and its Pulitzer-winning winning news. Melanie Brubaker Mazur Bayfield, Colo.

My wife and I have been readers of the Rocky Mountain News since we came to Colorado in 1967. We like everything about the paper, size, news, and comic strips. We hope a way can be found to keep it in circulation. After 149 years, it should not pass away. Louis Gagliano Louisville, CO.

I have been subscribing to the RMN since I started college back in 1983. My lunch breaks are spent reading it. It is the best source of local news, business and sports that we have. One of my favorite things is the tabloid format - it’s a much more reasonable size. Over the years, it has had the best comics - Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, Bloom County, Foxtrot, Baby Blues, etc. The Spotlight section has very broad appeal.
I hope the Rocky continues on for many years to come.

I would rather see the Post leave town. If given a choice which paper I would read, the RMN wins hands down. If I am in a restaurant, and only the Post is available, I just won’t read a paper with my lunch. I would rather do without than read the drivel and bias printed in the Post. That said however, I haven’t read much of either paper since they merged, and it became apparent that the RMN became another slanted, biased, opinionated newspaper like the Post. Unfortunately,the RMN became a subsidary of the Post. I and my family members weaned away from the local papers not long after Columbine, when the reports went on for years and years after Columbine should have been allowed to go away respectfully. It was overkill, and most of the stories lately have been similiar, that is, dragged out to the utmost and drained of all credibility and interest, except for the personal agenda extension of the reporter. So long Rocky Mountain News, perhaps you will come back as a “newspaper” in the afterlife, instead of a social engineering propaganda sheet that you evolved into. Matt, Golden

As a fan of American tabloids and metropolitan newspapers, I have been enamored of The Rocky Mountain News since I first discovered it as a teenager in the 1960s. I too love the size, the fonts, the feel of the Rocky– no other paper compares, really. I would mourn the loss of this irreplaceable jewel and hope it never comes to that. Colorado needs your voice loud and clear, not eviscerated or silenced. Chin up and fight on Rocky employees! You have my unending respect!

To the potential new owners of the “The Rocky” I would like to propose that the common sense approach of the many talented writers on staff will continue to bring an accountable and responsible news coverage to our area. One is dismayed over the many sound bites, with strictly an entertainment slant, we are fed on TV News coverage and the endless harping/dramatics to get the audiences to call the Talk shows. Of course there are exceptions, but when at one’s convenience you can sit down peaceably, focus your own thoughts over a well written article or gain a full understanding of an issue from a correspondent like those of the quality of a Tracy Ringlesby, Mike Rosen, Vincent Carrol, John Temple, Jeff Legwold–just to highlight a few of the talent. Denver Metro area has a need for a conservative and liberal paper for the 1/3 split of Democrats, Independents and Republicans in the market that ONE PAPER cannot serve. I was a Post reader for 22 years because I wanted an evening paper at that time. When it switched a morning paper and tired of it 95% liberal bias of correspondents, I heartily joined the “Rocky”!
