If you like rocks, minerals, fossils, gems, these are a MUST SEE. You'll find plenty at a Rock 'n' Gem show, from sparkling crystals and spectacular minerals to ancient fossils and cut gems. Shows vary in size but the larger ones have over 100 exhibitors and can take the better part of a day to get around. Some shows also have a lapidary or geology club exhibiting, either cutting and polishing gemstones or showing their geological collections.
