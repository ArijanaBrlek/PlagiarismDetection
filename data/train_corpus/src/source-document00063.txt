About Healthy Kids: Steering Committee
Message from the Chair
Dear Community Member,
It is a pleasure to be able to report to you on our first full year of operations of Healthy Kids. Turning the vision of Healthy Kids into reality has taken four years of work from many individuals and organizations.
Healthy Kids is a unique organization. It is a true community collaborative. Our community hospitals, clinics, county departments, community service organizations, and children health advocates worked together on a local solution to the problem of children access to healthcare.
What is extraordinary about this effort is that the solution is local. Our community is working together so that all children in Sonoma County have access to healthcare. I would like to thank all of the medical and dental providers, donors, community based organizations, and staff members who contributed to the successful launch of Healthy Kids.
Best,
Mary Maddux-Gonzalez, M.D. Chair, Steering Committee Healthy Kids Sonoma County
