Macro Property Measurement
Scope
Detection/measurement of properties of a non-uniform material/medium, objects (either natural or man-made, large or small), or structures.
While this title may not be common nomenclature, the capabilities and applications grouped under this heading are important to many of our clients and PNNL has a significant number of staff engaged in these activities.
For illustration, consider several examples of how Macro-Property measurements are distinguished from other sensing categories:
Measure of temperature at a in the atmosphere is a physical measurement (an individual sensor can be used) while measuring the temperature profile in a column of air above a test site is a macro-property measurement which may use a series of temperature sensors or an optical method using remote lasers and detection systemspoint
Detection and characterization of cracks in a metal pipe is a macro-property measurement which may use an electromagnetic, acoustic, or ultrasonic probe and specialized data acquisition and analysis methods
Representative Applications
Non-Destructive Evaluation (material integrity, defect detection & characterization)
Metrology (dimensional gauging, product inspection)
Shape & texture characterization
Remote sensing (thermal, vegetation, mineral, etc.)
Atmospheric & Marine measurements
