Applied Process Engineering Laboratory (APEL)
is an eastern Washington technology business startup user facility, sponsored in part by PNNL. APEL provides engineering- and manufacturing-scale space and chemical, biological, and electronic laboratories and equipment for developing, validating, and commercializing new products. Entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, and university staff can access this facility. PNNL scientists, engineers, and other professional staff are available to APEL occupants for consulting, collaboration, or professional support. APEL
Radiochemical Process Laboratory (RPL)
The is a user facility funded by DOE to create and implement innovative processes for environmental clean-up and the beneficial use of radioactive materials. These processes include those to advance the cleanup of radiological and hazardous wastes, the processing and disposal of nuclear fuels, and the production and delivery of medical isotopes. RPL
New Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Laboratory (BSEL)
Located on the Washington State University (WSU) Tri-Cities campus in Richland, Washington, is a joint effort between WSU and PNNL. Inside the BSEL, researchers are developing technology for converting low-value agricultural byproducts and residues into value-added chemicals for products like plastics, solvents, fibers, pharmaceuticals, and fuel additives.

Research Facilities
PNNL's specialized facilities allow our researchers to address a broad range of energy, environmental, health and national security issues for a variety of clients.
Electricity Infrastructure Operations Center (EIOC)
The at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory brings together industry-leading software, real-time grid data and advanced computation into a fully capable control room. Shaped with input from utilities, technology vendors and researchers across the Northwest, the EIOC serves as a unique platform for researching, developing and deploying technologies to better manage and control the grid. The new technologies developed here will be transferable across the industry and address the national need for a more reliable and effective electricity grid.

The Marine Sciences Laboratory (MSL)
The , Sequim Marine Research Operations is located on Sequim Bay in Washington's Puget Sound, offers various research capabilities in ecotoxicology, analytical chemistry, wetland and coastal ecology, fisheries, ocean processes, remote sensing, biotechnology and remediation. Marine Sciences Laboratory's
Research Aircraft Facility (RAF)
PNNL operates the to serve atmospheric scientists at DOE and other federal, state, and industrial laboratories in carrying out airborne research. This facility is dedicated to understanding atmospheric processes as they relate to the DOE's environmental missions and the global environment. Central to this facility is an advanced sampling platform, the PNNL Grumman Gulfstream 159 (G-1) aircraft and its flight crew, technical and engineering support staff, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.
