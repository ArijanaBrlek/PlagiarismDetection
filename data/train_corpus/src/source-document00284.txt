2.1 Experimental animals and protocols

Neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1-day-oldSprague–Dawley rats as described previously . Cellsuspensions were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and centrifugedat 500 for 5 min. The centrifuged cells were then resuspendedin 10% FBS-containing DMEM. For selective enrichment of cardiacmyocytes, the dissociated cells were preplated for 60 min, duringwhich time non-cardiac myocytes readily attached to the bottomof the culture dish. Using this method, we routinely obtainedenriched cultures containing >90% myocytes, as assayed byimmunofluorescence staining with an anti-myosin heavy chainantibody.2.2 Cell cultures and reagents

The left ventricles of mice were cut into 1-mm thick and fixedin 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at4 °C for 24 h; tissues were washed with ice-cold phosphatebuffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). For transmission electron microscopy,tissues were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4 °C for1 h, and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, substitutedwith propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon resin (Epok 812,Oken, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate and observed with a conventional transmissionelectron microscope (JEM-1200EX, JOEL, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleratingvoltage of 80-kV. Photographs were taken at 3000.2.3 Transmission electron microscopy

Gene transfection of cardiac myocytes with pSUPER–HspiRand pEGFP-C1 was performed using a Rat Cardiomyocyte-NeonatalNucleofector Kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), accordingto the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, freshly isolatedcardiac myocytes (1 10 cells) were suspended in the specifiedelectroporation buffer, and 3.6 µg of pSUPERHspiR and0.4 µg of pEGFP-C1 were added subsequently. After themixed solution was added to the special Nucleofector device(Amaxa Biosystems) for gene transfection, the transfected cellswere cultured on the cover slips in eight culture plates (1 10 cells/well, Lab-Tek chamber slide, Nunc, IN).2.4 Transfection

For immunostaining for VLDL-R in cardiac myocytes, the cellswere cultured on the cover slips in eight culture plates (Lab-Tekchamber slide) for 4 days, and treated with or without IL-1βfor 48 h. The cells were washed with phsoshate-buffered saline(PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, andtreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block endogenousperoxidase activity. Blocking was with 5% bovine serum albumin(BSA) for 15 min, incubated with anti-VLDL-R antibody (VR2:1/600) for 1 h, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugatedanti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA)for 45 min. The immunoreactive cells were detected with 3,3'-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride (DAB Substrate Kit: Vector Laboratories Inc.,Burlingame, CA).2.5 Immunostaining
For immunofluorescence double staining, the cells that weretransfected with the corresponding plasmids were cultured onthe cover slips in eight culture plates (Lab-Tek chamber slide)for 4 days, and treated with or without IL-1β for 48 h.The cells were fixed and blocked as described above, and incubatedwith primary antibodies against Hsp90 (2.5 µg/mL), VLDL-R(VR2: 1/600), and GFP (polyclonal: 1/500, monoclonal: 2 µg/mL)for 1 h. The secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,Inc., West Grove, PA) were used as follows: goat anti-mouseIgG conjugated with Cy3 for Hsp90, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugatedwith FITC for GFP (monoclonal), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugatedwith Cy3 for VLDL-R, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated withFITC for GFP (polyclonal). The cells were incubated with DAPI(Wako Pure Chemical Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for nucleic acid staining.After washing, the cells were mounted and observed using confocallaser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS-SP2 AOBS spectral, Heidelberg,Germany). No signals were detected when normal goat serum orirrelevant IgG was used instead of the primary antibody as anegative control.
β-VLDL and LDL were prepared and labeled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine(DiI) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described previously. To evaluate the uptake of DiI-lipoproteins, cells weretreated with or without 10 ng/mL IL-1β or 1000 U/mL IFN-for 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with 5%lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS)/DMEM containing 10 µg/mLDiI-labeled β-VLDL (DiI-β-VLDL) or 10 µg/mLDiI-labeled LDL (DiI-LDL) for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells werewashed with 2% BSA/PBS and fixed with 4% formalin in 0.3 M phosphatebuffer (pH 7.4). The uptake of DiI-lipoproteins was detectedby fluorescence microscopy (BX-51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.6 Lipoprotein preparation and immunofluorescence detection

Immunoblotting was performed as described previously . Briefly,cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer(25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate,50 mM NaF, 137 mM NaCl, 100 µM NaVO, 1% Triton X-100,10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and fresh 0.1 mMphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 µg/mL ofleupeptin). The cell lysates were prepared by scraping, sonication,and centrifugation. Cellular protein concentrations were determinedby the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were subjectedto SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the protein bandsthen transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranewas blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk, andthen incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primaryantibodies, followed by incubation for 1 h with the secondaryantibody, conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivebands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire,UK), with the level of protein expression being quantified usingNIH image 1.63 software.2.7 Immunoblotting

Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. For comparisonsbetween multiple groups, we determined the significance of thedifference between group means by one-way analysis of variance(ANOVA) or an unpaired t test. All analysis was performed usingStatView software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differenceswith values<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.2.10 Statistical analysis
