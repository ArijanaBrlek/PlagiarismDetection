History
California Highway Patrol Academy Founded 1930
The legislation which created the California Highway Patrol (CHP) also authorized establishment of its own training school; thus the CHP Academy was founded in 1930.
The original Academy was located at Mather Field near Sacramento. The first Academy class began on May 26, 1930, consisting of a two-week session for Inspectors and Captains. The first class for Traffic Officers began a few months later on September 16, 1930.
The Academy later moved to the State Fairgrounds in Sacramento under the grandstands. This location presented a rugged endurance and survival test for cadets since the concrete grandstand leaked in rainy weather and it was almost impossible to heat the classroom and dormitory areas.
A shortage of funds in 1938 caused the Academy to be suspended as a full-time training school and for the next 11 years it operated sporadically for recruit classes only.
The Expansion Years
The Academy was revived and given permanent status in 1948. The first fixed training facility was established in 1954 at a cost of approximately $600,000 on Meadowview Road in South Sacramento. This facility encompassed 224 acres and was designed to house 80 resident students. Temporary buildings were added in 1965 to accommodate 360 resident students during the Patrol's expansion in 1966-1968.
It readily became apparent that these temporary buildings would need to be replaced by a larger training facility. On September 17, 1974, groundbreaking ceremonies were held for a new Academy on a 457-acre site in Yolo County.

A recreation room is available for students' use during their leisure time. This room contains entertainment and recreational equipment, an interactive videodisc training computer, individual video training stations, snack facilities, wide screen television, an automated teller machine and the Recreation Fund Post Exchange (P.X.).

There are seven classrooms designed to accommodate a total of 362 students. Three of the classrooms are tiered, and interlocking walls make it possible to divide the rooms for smaller groups. Each classroom is equipped with a video projector and other standard audiovisual equipment. Additionally, connecting cables are available for computer generated classroom presentations.
