Research Area: Software Architecture
Technological advances continue to increase the volume, rate and complexity of data produced from modeling and simulation, high-throughput instruments, and system sensors. As a result, scientists and analysts are challenged with
capturing and integrating high-throughput sensor data
fusing and analyzing data in real time
managing diverse data formats and locations
integrating heterogeneous software and hardware systems.
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is aggressively working to solve the big-data challenge through research and development of data intensive computing technologies. A foundational piece is the Middleware for Data-Intensive Computing (MeDICi) project: an evolving middleware platform for building complex, high-performance analytical applications. These applications typically comprise a pipeline of software components-each of which performs some analysis on incoming data and passes on its results to the next step in the pipeline.
MeDICi comprises three major subcomponents that are loosely coupled: adaptive workflow for application coordination - SIFT for scalable component integration - and data virtualization for capturing provenance and managing logical files.
Approach
The workflow and model execution environment built on MeDICi enables applications to be wrapped as MeDICi components, which can simply be included in any number of workflows defined by scientists. The MeDICi technology is being designed to specifically address two difficult aspects of building analytical applications, namely:
The software components in an analysis pipeline have usually been created by different programmers using various programming languages, and each may have particular hardware platform dependencies. MeDICi provides features that make creating pipelines from heterogeneous, distributed components simple.Pipeline creation.
Passing large data sets between pipeline components can kill application performance. MeDICi provides features that give pipeline designers choices on how to pass data in pipelines to maximize application performance.Handling large data.
Impact
MeDICi makes it faster and less expensive to build scientific workflows in many science domains by providing a more scalable, flexible workflow environment that promotes ease of use for scientists and that can be easily modified and scaled to meet future research needs.
MeDICi is already in use for a range of applications at PNNL, including biological workflows, groundwater simulations, video processing, and satellite data processing.
