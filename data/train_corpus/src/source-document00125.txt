Windows: orientation and protection
Windows: orientation and protection
The right window size, frames, placement and glazing can reduce heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer.
Window frames and glazing
Timber or PVC framed windows transmit less heat than aluminium.
Double-glaze to reduce heat loss. Double-glazed windows are becoming more common in new homes and renovations. 'Add-on' double-glazing is available for existing homes using glass or acrylic.
Many windows will have an energy rating. Visit the Window Energy Rating (WERS) website for details (see link below).
Shading
Use external blinds or shutters to shade east and west facing windows. Shade windows to the north with eaves designed to let in winter sun and shade summer sun. Keep eaves on north-facing windows to a depth of 600mm so they don't block winter sun.
Placement and sizing
Determine the size and location of windows by the direction they face and the type of building materials used in the home.
North-facing windows should be in the family room, kitchen/meals area, lounge, dining and rumpus rooms as these rooms generally require heating. If possible, keep the north side of the home clear of large evergreen trees or high fences that could obstruct the winter sun.
Limit west-facing windows to reduce overheating in summer. Locate your garage or carport on the west side of your home.
Keep east-facing windows small. They provide early morning sun in winter but can overheat the home in summer.
Also keep south-facing windows small as they'll receive no direct sun in winter and lose heat instead. It's best to double-glaze windows on this side of your home.
