Minerals & More in Tucson
Gem-A is delighted to be hosting a two-week visit to the Tucson Arizona Gem Show, entitled Minerals & More in Tucson, from 1-14 February 2009. The largest gem and mineral fair in the world, the Tucson experience is not to be missed. The Provisional itinerary for the show includes the Tucson Gem and Mineral Fairs, a trip to see the flora and fauna of the Desert Museum and the opportunity to do some fantastic mineral shopping. Going to see the shows and getting to share your experience with others who share your passion for gemmology ensures that you will have a wonderful time. You will also be surrounded by knowledgeable and experienced Gem-A staff who can assist you with your stay—especially if it is your first visit! Our staff will also coordinate additional activities and dinners during the two weeks, which you may choose to take part in at your leisure. As Claire Mitchell, Gem-A Diamond Tutor states “Nothing can prepare you for the sheer scale of the Tucson shows; it is truly mind blowing. Tucson is a definite ‘must see’ at least once in your life.”
The cost of the show is £1560 per person, which includes flights from the UK, transportation by coach and bed and breakfast accommodation on a shared room basis. Places on this trip are strictly limited, as it is only possible to hold 11 rooms. Please contact Doug Garrod at immediately if you would like further information or a booking form. A non-refundable deposit of £650 per person is required to confirm your booking. doug@gem-a.com
