PINNACLE 5 MINERALS L.L.C.
SHOW SCHEDULE
Pinnacle 5 Minerals attends several shows throughout the year. We tailor our material for the shows we are attending. If you want us to bring specific material, contact us. We sell both wholesale and retail at all shows.
For the Denver Fall, Tucson, and Denver Spring shows, we set up in a hotel room which offers limited space. For these shows we limit our stock mostly to what we produce from our mining claims--amazonite and smoky quartz combination specimens, topaz, and other pegmatite minerals.
For other local Colorado shows, we bring a wide assortment of material, including cut stones, jewelry, hobby items, medium to high-end mineral specimens which include Colorado as well as world-wide specimens.
If you are a wholesale buyer interested in minerals suitable for resale at rockshops, online, or at gem and mineral shows, you may contact us to arrange a showing of wholesale material at our warehouse. This material is usually sold by the flat; however, you may pick and choose from our wholesale flats. Qualified resellers will also receive a discount price on our retail pieces.
Individual collectors are also welcome to contact us with your specific wants. We will arrange a private showing of our best pieces which most closely match your interests.
