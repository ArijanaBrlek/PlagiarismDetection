The project builds on the Vrije Universiteits Faculty of Arts recently-launched research emphasis (zwaartepunt), entitled: The Interplay of Religion, Politics and Culture: The Public Square and Channels of Mediation in the Netherlands, which aims in part at examining the constructed moral contours of public fora and public debates. See especially the publications: Van Eijnatten forthcoming (on the moral outlook of public functionaries); Van Eijnatten 2003 (on the changing character of public forums); and Kennedy 2005 (in which attention is directed toward moral citizenship within democratic discourse).
The project also builds on Universiteit Leiden's Department of Public Administration's NWO pioneer project , which dealt with the question of how the core concepts underlying the study of public administration have come about; particularly on the following articles written as part of it: Rutgers 2003; Rutgers and Schreurs 2003; Randeraad and Rutgers 2002; Rutgers 2001 (research into how differences in core values underlying public administration have come about and into the historical aspects of administrative culture); Wagenaar 2000; Wagenaar 2002 (two articles dealing with a 17th Century civil servants opinions on good and bad public governance). 'The Renaissance of Public Administration' (1998 - 2004)
Finally, the project also draws on the extensive research on corruption and integrity of governance conducted by prof. dr. L.W.J.C. Huberts since 1992, at the Vrije Universiteit's Department of Public Administration & Organization Science since 2005, especially on the following publications: Huberts1992; Van den Heuvel, Huberts and Verberk 1999; Van den Heuvel, Huberts and Verberk 2002; Van den Heuvel and Huberts 2003; Naeye.a. 2004; Huberts and Van den Heuvel 1999; Fijnaut and Huberts 2002; Huberts 1998; Huberts 2000; Huberts 2003; Huberts, Punch and Lamboo 2003; Van Duyne, Huberts and Van den Heuvel 2003 (research into integrity policy and corruption in the Netherlands and abroad, with a special emphasis on police corruption); Wagenaar 2003; Wagenaar and Van der Meij 2005 (articles pioneering the kind of research the project aims to conduct). strategic chair on integrity of governance
