Conservation Agreements and Planning in Idaho
It is estimated that two-thirds of our nation's lands are privately owned. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes that the key to ensuring healthy fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats rests in the hands of private landowners.
Our Conservation Planning Program provides opportunities for the Service to work with interested landowners to restore and maintain quality habitat. Through this Program, Service personnel use collaborative methods to provide technical and financial assistance needed to protect species and enhance the ecosystems upon which they depend. Participation in all programs is voluntary.
We are interested in developing strong partnerships with landowners to manage and conserve native fish, wildlife and plant species such as migratory birds, and threatened, endangered, or other sensitive species. We often work with landowners across the Idaho landscape, including wetland, riparian, sagebrush, grasslands, forest and aquatic habitats.

Conservation Planning Tools
Conservation Agreements are tools for non-federal landowners wishing to work with the Service to conserve listed or at-risk species, consistent with existing land use practices and management. Participants in these agreements commit to actions on their property that will reduce threats to species and enhance their conservation.
Agreements may include Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCAs), Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAAs), Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) and Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs). For more information: Conservation Planning Tools in Idaho - Fact Sheets
