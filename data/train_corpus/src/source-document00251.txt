The home of Poker Professional Michael “The Grinder” Mizrachi, Absolute Poker is a professional site with a formal mission statement of “To continue to be the best and most trusted.” Graphically their website and software is not the most pleasing, BUT, it is one of the most user friendly. During game play, the buttons are large and the statistics options are easy to use, read, and understand. Competition on this site tends to be softer at the lower stake games.
