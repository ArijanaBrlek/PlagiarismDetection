Change to the Work Sample Submittal Process
In the OREA Licensing Handbook, the references to submittal of work samples on pages 4, 6, 14, 15 and 16 should be disregarded. OREA licensing staff will contact the applicant regarding the submittal of work samples, based on the work experience log submitted with the license application.
NEW LICENSING REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
In February 2004, The Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB) of the Appraisal Foundation adopted changes to the real property appraiser qualifications criteria that will become effective January 1, 2008. The requirements individuals must meet in order to become a licensed or certified appraiser will change significantly. The changes include increased requirements for qualifying education and experience, and a new Uniform State Appraiser Examination.
The manner in which the Office of Real Estate Appraisers will implement the new criteria is important to understand. For all initial license applications and upgrade applications received on or after January 1, 2008, applicants must meet all components (education, experience, and examination) of the new requirements.
Initial or upgrade applications received on or before December 31, 2007, will be reviewed based on current licensing requirements. However, if an examination is not taken until after January 1, 2008, the examination content will be based on 2008 criteria. Any deficient component of an application not completed prior to December 31, 2007, will be required to meet the 2008 new requirements. This pertains primarily to the education and examination components.
Please refer to this website frequently. Additional information will be posted as it becomes available.
The real property appraiser criteria effective January 1, 2008 are summarized in the following table.
