About the VLMS:
We welcome anyone with an interest in rocks, minerals, crystals, lapidary arts or with an interest in earth sciences. Our membership consists of approximately 100 individuals from all walks of life ranging in age from 8 to seasoned veteran. The club provides classes for it's members in a variety of areas. Classes are taught by experienced members of the club and are provided for a nominal fee. During Mid March the VLMS club holds their big International 'Rock and Gem Show' at the Leonardo da Vinci centre, please follow the link for more information. This International show has something of interest for everyone. Kids activity room, lapidary demonstrations, gem faceting, silver smithing, retailers, and display cases from Vancouver Island clubs. There are also door prizes and a raffle. In April of each year the club holds an auction of used equipment and lapidary material. The event is a means for the club to raise funds and provide the members with an opportunity to acquire 'new' treasures. Each month, at the club meeting, a guest speaker is invited to provide a presentation. Past topics have included: the Vancouver Island Earthquake Zone, collecting sites on Vancouver Island, micro-crystalography and a geologic survey of British Columbia. Field trips are planned and attempted (weather permitting) on a monthly basis. The trips usually start in the morning and go until around three in the afternoon please see for more information.
