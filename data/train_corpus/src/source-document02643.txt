Cinco de Mayo Festival
I was disappointed by the variety of the Mexican food at Sunday's Cinco de Mayo Festival in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
That's not to say you couldn't chow down, once you made your way through the midafternoon crowds: I found chili-sprinkled mangos and corn on the cob, Colombian skirt steak, heaping plates of frituras, rice, and beans from pan-Latin vendors, and many, many Mexican tacos. But I simply didn't see the I adore at Red Hook; huaraches even make an appearance at the There was certainly nothing as lovely and unexpected as the I recently discovered by the roadside in Bushwick. huaraches and quesadillas much smaller festivals on 116th St. Mexican ice cream
The most heavily laden tortilla below, from the Jackson Heights restaurant Bella Puebla, packed rice, beans, chicken, and a chili-packed Oaxaque a-style mole sauce (three for $10, though mine was courtesy of a fellow diner; thanks, Louis!). From a Michoacano vendor, the other two tacos ($2.50 each) featured buche, which might be pig's stomach or from the area immediately surrounding it, and carnitas, or seasoned pork from the more familiar parts of the animal. At the end of it all, I did find a shady spot for a little (relatively) quiet time.
