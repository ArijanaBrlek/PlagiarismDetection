Flushing Meadows Corona Park Pool & Rink
Queens
This $66.3-million complex features an Olympic-sized pool and NHL-regulation ice rink. It is the first of its kind in the city and includes ADA-accessible features.
Flushing Meadows Corona Park Pool & Rink is the largest recreation complex ever built in a city park at 110,000 square-feet. The Olympic-size indoor public pool, the first to open in New York City in four decades, has an adjustable floor and diving tank for public swim and competitive meets. The NHL-standard indoor ice hockey rink will serve as a year-round facility for competitive leagues and individual skaters. The modernist, architecturally distinguished building cable-supported roof system will allow for potential future expansion.
