Unlike most conventional at burnersout there, Animal Cuts is more than just a thermogenic. It is a comprehensive and complete formula. Take a look at the leading fat burner. It might contain ephedrine, caffeine, possibly an aspirin-derivative, and a few other ingredients sprinkled in. Make no mistake about ithis is a thermogenic product and only a thermogenic product. These basic ingredients make up the classic E/C/A stack that most people find effective (up to 95% of all fat burners are based on this model). But the fact is, the E/C/A stack may not work well for everyone. Maybe youe been on the E/C/A stack for a while now. Maybe you drink a lot of coffee in the morning and soda throughout the day. The human body can easily become desensitized to the ingredients in this stack after prolonged use, thus reducing its effectiveness. For some athletes, the problem may even transcend thermogenesis. Your problem, for instance, might be releasing stored bodyfat. Or maybe you have a sluggish thyroid (thyroid hormones directly control your body metabolism). You might be insulin-resistant, a condition which makes it extremely difficult to shed bodyfat. Impaired neurotransmitter function can also make life difficult, encouraging bingeing.
