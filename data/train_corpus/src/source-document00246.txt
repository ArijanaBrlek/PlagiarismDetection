How does it work?
All you need to do to take advantage of WebRunner is to download a small piece of software (5 megs). The WebRunner software talks to a server in our data center, compressing and delivering Web content to your PC at lightening-fast speeds. Your WebRunner software then decompresses the information. 
This means you get all the stuff you want to see, really fast at a huge savings compared to other High-Speed options.
