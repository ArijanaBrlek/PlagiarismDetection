MAINTENANCE TIPS
First, check the sash lock mechanism to make sure it’s completely unlocked. Then turn the handle slightly and push very gently on the sash near the lock mechanism. The sash should pop open. Open the window, and check the surface of the weatherstripping. You may want to apply a thin coat of dry lubricant to prevent sticking. Check to see that the operating sash guide is clean. Over time, dirt and debris can settle in the guide, making it difficult to open and close the sash. Try cleaning with soapy water and a soft brush, then wipe with a clean, damp cloth to remove soap residue. You should avoid scrub pads and abrasive cleansers. After the area is dry, applying a Teflon or silicon based lubricant to the area will help the sash operate smoothly. If cleaning doesn’t do the trick, you may have a problem.
