A. William Henry Harrison, died in office (1841); Zachary Taylor, died in office (1850); Abraham Lincoln, assassinated (1865); James A. Garfield, assasinated (1881); William McKinley, assassinated (1901); Warren Harding, died in office (1923); Franklin Delano Roosevelt; died in office (1945); John F. Kennedy, assasinated (1963); Richard M. Nixon, resigned (1974) and technically Gerald Ford (since he was never elected to office, he "never completed a term to which he was elected"). Of the eight Presidents whose terms were ended by their deaths, four of the Vice-Presidents who ascended to office were elected for their own term (Theodore Roosevelt, 1904; Calvin Coolidge, 1924; Harry Truman, 1948 and Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964) and the others (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson and Chester Arthur) had been themselves elected to the office of Vice President.
