Free High Res Grungy Paper Textures
Posted inDecember 17, 2007| Freebies |
After my first texture release, some of you mentioned you might find some ‘paper’ textures useful, so I guess you could say that this is a requested freebie. Not much else to say other than keep the requests coming. Download the High Res images from Flickr by clicking on the pics. The full size images are 2005 X 3000 px :)

Finally Bitt is back..
I seriously miss your good old articles about illustrator and i’ve watched in horror when PS guys & girls screams for psd’s and you followed their wink.
There are so many blogs about PS, but only one or two about vector - keep it up Bitt :-)
Brilliant! These are wonderful and will certainly be used.
Thanks Bitt!

[...] We need to gather the assets for this tutorial. We’ll need a constructivist typeface. Fortunately there is one available for free: Kremlin. Make sure you install this as we’ll need it later on in this tut. Here are links to the graphics for this tutorial: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4. After selecting the graphics we need to download and then prep them. Change the colors to grayscale and cut the backgrounds out (use whatever method you prefer to get rid of the background). There is one more image for this tutorial. Its some grunge paper from Bittbox. Its available in a free download pack at this link: Free High Res Grungy Paper Textures. [...]
