The Adam Mickiewicz Institute wishes to invite you to the exhibition of works made as part of the Polish-Israeli documentary workshops devoted to the March '68 events in Poland. In March 1968 the communist authorities in Poland launched an anti-Semitic campaign which forced over 14 thousand people of Jewish descent to emigrate. They left for Israel, Scandinavian countries, United States and France, simply they dispersed around the world. The anti-Semitic propaganda controlled by the officials as well as brutal treatment on the part of the communist secret Police, contributed to a witch-hunt atmosphere and mass fear which left deep wounds in Polish society as well as feelings of bitterness and injustice in those who left Poland. The exhibition "March 68. Farewells and Returns" is an attempt at re-thinking and reliving this sad history lesson.
