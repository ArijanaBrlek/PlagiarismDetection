Synoptic chronology of Greek Thinkers and Writers
This synopsis presents a visual chronology of some of the Greek writers and thinkers that preceeded, were contemporaries of, and followed Socrates and Plato, allowing to quickly see in what order they lived and who was contemporary of whom. It also includes for context some of the most prominent political leaders of the time. The dates are associated with the Olympiad numbers that were used as reference by the Greek themselves. The reader must be warned that many of the dates of birth and death here provided are only tentative, and may differ in different sources, sometimes (such as with Parmenides, for instance) by several years. The purpose of this synopsis is not to pretend to utmost accuracy, or to suggest new datings, but to provide a feel for who might have been contemporary of whom. Accordingly, the dates used were those available from widely available history books or encyclopediae, and I didn't try to ascertain these before using them.
To get a more "concrete" feel for this chronology, a down to Plato's last years puts it in parallel with modern times assuming 1999 to be the year of Dion's assassination, that is 354 B. C. (7 years before Plato's death). In it, you will see that this puts Socrates' trial at the height of McCarthyism (1954), Marathon the same year as Gettysburg (1863), that it makes Socrates a contemporary of FDR, Parmenides a contemporary of Nietzsche, and much more... modified version of this page
