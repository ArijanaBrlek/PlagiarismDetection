Sensory Science/Postharvest Physiology
Major Responsibilities/Research Interests
Research interests in the sensory science area focus on odour and taste perceptions in humans. Smell identification and threshold tests were used to explore the olfactory capabilities of varsity athletes involved in contact sports. Most recently, research was performed to examine the perception of basic tastes and fruit flavours as modified by acid and sugar in fruit and fruit products. Ethnic taste preferences for kiwifruit selections have been elucidated using a preference map, a technique which provides information to fruit breeders about consumer preferences for new and future fruit varieties. In postharvest physiology, recent research has explored antioxidant systems in cold-stressed spinach and membrane stability in cold-stressed potato tubers.
