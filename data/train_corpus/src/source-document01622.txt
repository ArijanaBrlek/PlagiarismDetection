Circumventing roadblocks to healthy weight loss
Why do some weight loss programs fail?
Diets, especially fad diets or “quick-fix” pills and plans, often set you up for failure because:
Diets that don’t allow certain types of food (carbs, fat, sugar) in moderation are simply not practical, not to mention unhealthy – eliminating entire food groups doesn’t allow for a healthy, well-rounded diet.You feel deprived.
There’s actually a second component to healthy weight loss: exercise. Often your body adjusts to your new way of eating, and it’s only with increased physical activity that the pounds will continue to melt away.You “plateau” after losing a few pounds.
Diets that severely cut calories, restrict certain foods, or rely on ready-made meals might work in the short term. However, once you meet your weight loss goal, you have no means of lifelong, healthy diet maintenance,  and the pounds come quickly come backYou lose weight, but can’t keep it off.
. Just because you gave in to temptation and overindulged, doesn’t mean all your hard work goes down the drain. Healthy eating is about the big picture – an occasional splurge won’t kill your efforts. And again, diets that are too restrictive are conducive to cheating – when you feel deprived, it’s easy to fall off the wagon.You break your diet and feel too discouraged to try again
. Special shakes, meals, and programs may be cost-prohibitive.You lose money faster than you lose weight
Without some practical, healthy diet strategies, you may feel lost when dining out or attending events like cocktail parties or weddings. If the food served isn’t on your specific diet plan, what can you do?You feel isolated and unable to enjoy social situations revolving around food.
Restricting your caloric intake slows down your metabolism – another reason why starvation or “fasting” diets are counterproductive.After your diet, you seem to put on weight more quickly.
Diet companies make a lot of grandiose promises, and most are simply not realistic. Unfortunately, losing weight is not easy, and anyone who makes it seem that way is doing you a disservice. Don’t get discouraged by setting unrealistic goals!The person on the commercial lost 30 lbs in 2 months – and you haven’t.
Why do some weight loss programs succeed?
While there’s no “one size fits all” solution to lifelong, healthy weight loss, try these tips:
–Short-term goals, like wanting to fit into a bikini for the summer, usually don’t work as well as goals like wanting to feel more confident or become healthier for your children’s sakes. Keep your focus: when frustration and temptation strike, concentrate on the many benefits you’ll reap from being healthier and leaner.Stay motivated
Social support means a lot. Programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers use group support to impact weight loss and lifelong healthy eating. Seek out support, whether in the form of family, friends, or a support group, so that you can get the encouragement you need.Find a cheering section
. Experiment until you find a good, long-term plan that helps you lose the weight and maintain that loss in a way that works for you. If you cut out just 100 calories a day you would lose 10 pounds in a year. Remember one 12 oz can of a popular soda contains 150 calories.       Commit to a plan and stick to it
Emotional and social components of healthy weight loss
Food isn’t just used to satisfy hunger – it is also a common part of social interactions and a means of comfort and stress relief. How we eat is also partially dictated by how we were raised – “clean your plate – there’s children starving in Africa” – and how the people around us eat. If your friends and relatives start packing on the pounds, you are more likely to do so as well.
What’s a healthy dieter to do? First, consider how and when you eat. Do you only eat when you are hungry, or do you reach for a snack while watching TV? Do you eat when you’re stressed or bored? To reward yourself? Also pay attention to how much sleep you are getting lack of sleep has been shown to have a direct link to hunger and overeating.

Recognizing your emotional triggers can help make it easier for you to make changes. Once you realize your own personal challenges to weight loss, you can work towards gradually changing the habits and mental attitudes that have sabotaged your efforts in the past.
Is stress and anxiety contributing to your weight gain?
Stress eating is a common problem. Instead of self-medicating with food, try alternative means of stress relief. Read and for tips and suggestions. Coping With Stress How to Stop Worrying
Mindful eating helps healthy weight loss
Paying attention to what you eat, savoring each bite, and choosing foods that are both nourishing and enjoyable helps healthy weight loss and maintenance. Plus, when our minds are tuned out during mealtime, the digestive process may be 30% to 40% less effective. This can contribute to digestive distress, such as gas, bloating and bowel irregularities.
Mindful Eating tips for Healthy Weight Loss 
Pay attention while you are eating. Be aware of your environment; eat slowly, enjoying each bite – savor the smells and textures of your food. If your mind wanders, just gently remind yourself to return to focusing on your food and how it tastes and feels in your mouth.
Avoid distractions while eating. Try not to eat while working, watching TV, reading or using a computer.
Try mixing things up to force yourself to focus on the experience of eating – try using chopsticks rather than a fork, or use your utensils with your non-dominant hand
Chew your food thoroughly.
Stop eating before you are stuffed. Avoid the temptation to “clean your plate”. Yes, there are children starving in Africa, but you packing on the pounds won’t help them!
If eating alone, leave the table as soon as you are full. The longer you sit at the table, the more you will eat.
Skip the all-you-can eat buffets. Too many choices at once leads to over consumption
Eat from small plates, bowls and cups. This will make your portions appear larger.
Don’t eat out of large bags or boxes. Buy single serving snacks or create your own small portions in plastic bags or containers.
Weight Loss Myths: Fact or Fiction?
MYTH: If you raise your metabolism, you can eat more and still lose weight!
FACT: Your metabolism controls how fast and in what way you burn the calories you consume. We burn calories throughout the day in many ways – from breathing to walking the dog. Despite the claims of the diet pill manufacturers, you have very little ability to change your metabolism. But you can help your body burn more calories by incorporating lifestyle changes, like more exercise.
MYTH: “Carbs” are evil!
FACT: The popularity of low-carb diets has made people crazy about counting carbs, but this is far less important than counting calories. The long-term effects of high-fat, high-protein diets are still unknown, but we do know that a diet high in good carbohydrates (which are lower in calories than fat) coming from whole grains, fruits, and veggies, provides adequate nutrition and can be ideal for weight loss.
MYTH: Fasting is a great way to lose weight.
FACT: Hollywood starlets swear by “fasts” or “cleanses” where they eat practically nothing for days. Starving yourself can help you drop a few pounds fast, but chances are you will regain that weight as soon as you start eating again, not to mention the numerous negative health effects a starvation diet can cause (gallstones, fainting, malnutrition...just to name a few.) Also, losing a lot of weight rapidly usually means you’re losing muscle and water rather than fat.
MYTH: To lose weight, eat fat-free foods.
FACT: Fat-free does not mean calorie-free. Many fat-free versions of your favorite products have the same or more calories as the originals, because sugar has to be added to replace the flavor that is lost when the fat is taken out. Remember that you need to watch your caloric intake in order to lose weight, so keep track of the foods you are eating, fat-free or otherwise.
Fat: Friend or Foe?
Along with benefiting nearly every organ in the body, fat also fills you up better than carbohydrates. Good fats come from whole, natural, unprocessed sources. Fats turn bad when they are processed, or damaged by light, heat, oxygen or chemicals. Eating reasonable amounts of natural fats coming from foods like avocados, nuts, and seeds may help you lose more weight by getting you fuller faster and providing the healthy fats your body needs.To learn more read . Healthy Fats
MYTH: Sugar-free foods and artificial sweeteners are great for avoiding weight gain.
FACT: True, diet soft drinks and artificially-sweetened yogurts, ice cream and other snacks are often lower in calories. But sugar substitutes may interfere with your body's natural regulation system and result in your overindulging in other sweet foods and beverages.

Eating and drinking tips
. The high water and fiber content in many fruits and vegetables make them great candidates for healthy snacking and incorporation into meals. Try adding veggies to your favorite main courses (made from lean meats and whole grains) to make your dish “go” further. In addition, the vitamins and nutrients in fruits and vegetables can help your overall health and vitality.Focus on fruits and veggies
Protein keeps you full longer than carbohydrates. It also takes more energy to metabolize protein than carbohydrates, so you burn more calories after eating it.Eat more protein.
. Fiber makes you feel fuller faster, so it’s a great idea to choose foods that are packing a good fiber punch. Fiber will also help digestion, allowing you to process what you eat in a healthier way.Fill up on fiber
. Foods that allow you to eat larger portion sizes with lower calories are considered low density. These foods (including many fruits and vegetables) tend to contain more water and fiber. Try starting your meal with a low-density salad or soup (just watch the dressings and sodium) to help fill you up, so you will eat less of your entrée.Choose “low density” foods
Not drinking enough water makes your body hold on to the water it has – resulting in extra “water weight”. Thirst can also be confused with hunger, so by drinking water, you may avoid consuming extra calories.Drink lots of water.
Soda: The Secret Diet Sabotager
According to The Center for Science in the Public Interest, soft drinks are the single biggest source of calories in the American diet, providing about 7 percent of calories. One can of soda pop contains between 10-12 teaspoons of sugar and around 150 calories, so a few soft drinks can quickly add up to a good portion of your daily calorie intake.
Cutting out soft drinks may be an easy way to help you lose some extra weight. Try switching to water with lemon, unsweetened iced tea, or an occasional spritzer made with a touch of juice (juice contains a lot of calories, so use just a taste) and carbonated water.
. Remember this old saying: breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper. Starting your day with a healthy breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism. Likewise, “grazing” on healthful snacks like fruits, veggies and protein-packed almonds, and eating 6 small, healthful meals throughout the day, rather than the standard 3 large ones, can help keep your metabolism going and ward off snack attacks.Eat early, eat often
No matter how healthy your diet, you need to eat less to lose weight. This means practicing portion control. At restaurants, eat only half your meal and take the rest home. Also watch out for condiments, dressings, and soft drinks, which are common culprits for hidden calories.
