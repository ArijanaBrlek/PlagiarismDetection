Small Game, Big Fun: 2008-09 small game hunting outlooks
This is the year! Set your calendar for a week earlier than past years. Small game season for quail, squirrel, ducks and more opens Friday, Oct. 3.
Abundant snow and rainfall has occurred since the end of 2007. Much of the precipitation fell at the right times and in the right areas. In short, plenty of water, ground cover and food made for good reproduction. The outlook for small game hunting statewide looks very good.
: Although Gambel quail populations were low last year, the amount of rain this spring and summer will increase their populations and should offer some fair to very good hunting, depending on where you hunt. Scaled quail populations overall should be fair. Rainfall in southeastern Arizona was not as abundant as the central portions of the state. However, there are reports that some areas have favorable populations of scalies. Mearnsquail season doesn open until Nov. 28. Last year proved to be a great year, and this year should prove to be just as good for these high country birds.Quail
: Every hunter should be able to put a rabbit in their bag this year, as populations are good to excellent throughout the state. Although the season is all year long, many consider opening day the same as quail season. Hunting washes, edge cover and glassing from ridges can be very productive. Bag limits are liberal and the meat is excellent.Rabbit
: Mark this as the year to be excited about squirrels. The season runs until the end of December now. If youe finding young birds when quail hunting opening weekend, mark your spot for later and head north for some exciting tree squirrel hunting action. Adults are reminded that this hunt isn just for the kids. Try taking one with a .22 handgun for a challenging shot. Hunters should enjoy hunting conditions that rate from fair to good, and some spots will be excellent.Squirrel
: The waterfowl season is liberal, opening in the mountain zone the same day (Oct. 3) and running until the end of January 2009. However, canvasback ducks are not allowed for harvest due to declining numbers, and there is a shorter / restricted season for scaup ducks (see regulations for all season dates). Depending on the timing of the migration, Arizona has plenty of water to hold waterfowl during the season, and this year has the potential to be a very good duck season.Waterfowl
While all this news is exciting, the best thing about small game season is no draw. Hunters can pick up a general hunting license, buy some shotgun shells and hit the road. By the way, don forget that kids 13 and under can hunt for free with no license (two max.) when accompanied by a licensed adult 18 and older. And for hunters ages 14-20, the youth combination hunting and fishing license is only $26.50.

Fall outdoor hunting activities just for the kids
See Arizona unique wildlife and reconnect with nature
Javelina, turkey and sandhill cranes - oh my! It may not be exactly like the famous Wizard of Oz quote, ions and tigers and bearsbut to many it still invokes a sense of mystery and adventure.   In an effort to get kids into a natural environment and to increase their awareness of the importance of hunting as a wildlife management tool, the Arizona Game and Fish Department has created a number of youth programs to introduce kids to the outdoors. Participating in hunting and fishing is America original outdoor challenge. 
Starting this fall there are three hunts available to young hunters ages 10-17, including:
. There are two hunts to choose from, Oct. 10-16 and Nov. 21-30. There are a number of hunting areas to choose from. However, tags are limited and must be obtained by submitting an application by mail; for details, visit . Javelina are unique to the Southwest, with a wide distribution in Arizona. Javelina offer an excellent introduction to the skills needed for other big game hunting like deer and elk. As for edibility, they make very good chorizo breakfast sausage, Italian and bratwurst sausages, as well as roasts and stews.Juniors-only fall javelina big game hunt www.azgfd.gov/draw
. There is one hunt Oct. 3-9. Tags are unlimited and can be purchased over-the-counter for $10 at any department office. There are a number of open hunting areas, including some areas around Flagstaff, the White Mountains and the North Kaibab. Wild turkeys inhabit the forested highlands of our state. Wild turkeys are similar to domestic birds, but leaner, so don overcook and youl be treated to a Thanksgiving family feast to be proud of.Juniors-only fall turkey big game hunt
. There is one hunt Dec. 12-14 in the southeastern part of the state. Tags are limited and must be obtained by submitting an application by mail; for details, visit . Sandhill cranes are large (5-foot wingspan), spectacular birds, which closely resemble a terradactyl. They migrate to the state and winter in wetland areas. They are very wary birds and are challenging to decoy within shooting range, making for an amazing hunting experience. Most surprising is they provide incredible table fare, often referred to as he flying rib-eye steak.The department will have check stations with mentors and guides to offer help.Juniors-only sandhill crane hunt www.azgfd.gov/draw
For instructions on applying for javelina or sandhill crane tags, visit and find the hunt number of the area you wish to hunt from the list of left-over fall hunts and/or the left-over list for sandhill cranes. Fill out the unt Permit/Tag Application Formper the instructions and mail it to: Arizona Game and Fish Department, P.O. Box 52002, Phoenix, AZ 85072-2002. www.azgfd.gov/draw
Young hunters ages 10-13 are required to have completed a certified hunter education course to hunt big game (javelina and turkey). All youth hunting big game are also required to have a general hunting license.
There is no hunter education requirement to hunt sandhill cranes, although it is encouraged. Additionally, youth hunters 10-13 do not need a general hunting license when accompanied by a licensed adult when hunting sandhill cranes. 
Many families that have relocated to Arizona came from rural families who used to hunt. But now in Arizona, they are in unfamiliar country and not sure how to, nor do they have the network of friends and other family members they did in their hometowns. To change that, the department is reaching out to the public to introduce them to hunting in the Southwest through workshops, clinics, check stations and online information.

Dusky luegrouse range expanded to Mogollon Rim by Game and Fish
Chicken-sized bird offers upland hunters and bird-watchers a unique opportunity
The dusky luegrouse population and range are increasing in Arizona due to recent translocation efforts by the Arizona Game and Fish Department to offer upland hunters, bird watchers, and outdoor recreationists another area to enjoy this unique bird. Over a two-week-long effort, Arizona Game and Fish biologists, wildlife managers and interns worked tirelessly in the field to capture 20 birds near Moab, Utah, and then 12 more from the North Kaibab Plateau in Arizona. Thirty-two blue grouse in total were captured, banded, and some fitted with transmitters, and then released near the Rim Lakes on the Mogollon Rim.   his first translocation went very well,said Ron Day, small game, predator and furbearer biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. any thanks go to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, who allowed us to capture grouse from their state. Utah has a much more robust dusky grouse population, and we were able to capture a lot of birds in a short time.br>  Dusky grouse, previously referred to as blue grouse, are the second largest of the grouse family. Males can weigh up to 3 pounds. They are a dusky blue-grey color and, like most grouse, exhibit the broad fan-tail with a distinctive band across the feathers. Their habitat consists of subalpine mixed conifer forests of Douglas fir, spruce, aspen and grassland meadow areas for foraging. Before this translocation, blue grouse could only be found on the North Kaibab Plateau, the highest peaks of the White Mountains, and a very limited range atop the San Francisco Peaks.   ur research determined this area of the Mogollon Rim has a large amount of contiguous mixed conifer habitat that is very suitable for grouse,says Day. ur goal is to bring this unique bird into sustainable populations to offer sportsmen and wildlife watchers a closer location to enjoy these birds.br>  In the second year of a five-year effort to expand the range of the blue grouse to this region, additional translocations may involve up to four different release sites and, when established, should provide for sustainable populations for years to come.   The project is funded through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife Restoration Program, which generates its funding through excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, archery equipment and arrow components and then apportions the funding to state wildlife agencies.   However, grouse hunters should note that Unit 4A and 5A are closed hunting areas. There is no hunting allowed in the area of a translocation for five years after the last transplant date. For example, if this were the last translocation, these birds could not be hunted until 2013.   Also, turkey hunters in Units 4A and 5A are cautioned to be certain of their target. Blue grouse look very similar to a young turkey.   For future hunters, the prospect of hunting this challenging bird and then taking in some trout fishing on the Mogollon Rim will be well worth today efforts. Science-based translocation programs follow the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and are designed to increase diversity of wildlife populations throughout the state and beyond to the benefit of all citizens.
  
Information needed to solve bull elk poaching near Williams
The Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking for the public help in finding a poacher that killed a large bull elk sometime during the weekend of Sept. 6. The poaching occurred near Scholz Lake and Garland Prairie along Forest Road 141, just east of Williams.    The elk was shot with archery equipment and was left in the field to waste. The poaching took place a week prior to the opening weekend of the legal archery elk season. A field investigation also discovered that the animal had been shot several times in the head. Game and Fish officials believe that someone may have come across the wounded elk and put the animal down by shooting it.
his is a blatant example of poachersdisrespect for wildlife, and the laws and seasons that are established to protect our wildlife resources,says Wildlife Manager Mike Rice.  e need help from the public to catch the poacher. If you were in the area recently, please try to recall anything you might have seen or heard, or any conversations you may have had. Maybe someone doesn realize he or she has the key to solving this case. Poaching of wildlife is considered a major loss for the residents of Arizona and our wildlife resources.
Anyone with information about this poaching can call the department Operation Game Thief hotline toll-free at (800) 352-0700. Callers may be eligible for a reward of up to $350 in this case.  All calls may remain confidential upon request.

Coming to a sporting store near you: non-lead ammunition displays
The next time you shop at Sportsman Warehouse, Cabela or Bass Pro stores in Arizona, look for the Arizona Game and Fish Department new non-lead ammunition displays.
The new displays, supported by partners like the Arizona Deer Association, Arizona Elk Society, Arizona Antelope Foundation, Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society, Arizona Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation and the sporting retailers, feature information on the performance benefits of non-lead ammunition, as well as the benefits to wildlife.
The department expects the displays to help hunters more quickly locate the non-lead ammunition theye looking for while also increasing awareness of lead toxicity in wildlife, especially the endangered California condor.
Lead toxicity continues to be the greatest obstacle to achieving a self-sustaining population of condors in the state. Studies show that lead shot and bullet fragments found in game carcasses and gut piles are the main source of lead in condors.    Condors were added to the federal endangered species list in 1967. The condor is the largest flying land bird in North America. They can weigh up to 26 pounds and have a wingspan of up to 9 1/2 feet. Condors were first reintroduced in Arizona in 1996, and they can often be seen at the Grand Canyon during the spring and summer, and in the Vermilion Cliffs during the winter.
The department and its partners encourage hunters to continue their proud tradition of wildlife conservation by using non-lead ammunition in condor range (Game Management Units 9, 10, 12A/B, and 13A/B).
The department started offering free non-lead ammunition in 2005 to hunters drawn for hunts in the condor core range, which includes Game Management Units 12 A/B and 13A.  Surveys show that more than 80 percent of hunters took measures last year to reduce the amount of lead available to condors versus 60 percent in 2006.
 
Want to learn how to hunt tree squirrels?
The Arizona Game and Fish Department will conduct a free small game hunting camp on Oct. 10 and 11 in the White Mountains to provide Arizona youth and others with the basic skills they need to successfully pursue tree squirrels. The program will also provide an overview of hunting opportunities for other small game species in our state. Youth need to be at least 8 years old to participate.
"This intensive camp is designed to provide youth and those new to hunting with an opportunity to enhance their hunting knowledge and skills here in Arizona, while also teaching them the values of stewardship and wildlife conservation," says Wildlife Manager Supervisor Mike Godwin. "The workshop is all about hands-on learning, asking questions, and being with others who are also interested in hunting in our state."
The camp will be held at the Los Burros Campground, located on Forest Road 224 that runs between Vernon and McNary. The program will cover hunting opportunities, firearm safety and game care. Other activities include archery instruction and 3-D shooting, survival basics, first aid and more. Instructional sessions begin at 6 p.m. on Friday, and participants will hunt in the field with mentors Saturday.
The workshop, sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, includes meals, instruction and field time with hunting mentors. The program is aimed at developing responsible and successful hunters who recognize the importance of wildlife and habitat conservation. The White Mountain Rod and Gun Club will also be assisting with the event.
For more information or to sign up, contact or call the department Pinetop office at (928) 367-4281. The workshops are free, but pre-registration is required.
