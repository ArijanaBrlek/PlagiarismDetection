New discoveries are made every day at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and many of those evolve into technologies and patents that become available for licensing. One of the Laboratory's missions is to develop and deploy socially and economically valuable science and technology. With a rich history of securing patents and software copyrights for our technologies, PNNL holds more than 1,446 U.S. and foreign patents in our growing portfolio.
On this website, available technologies are organized by PNNL name and by potential application, making it easier for you to find solutions faster. This list of technologies is dynamic—new entries are added as new technologies become available and some are removed as licensing occurs—so we encourage you to check back frequently. We welcome you to contact the commercialization manager responsible for a specific technology portfolio as listed on each technology page.
