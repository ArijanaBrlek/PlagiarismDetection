Both the law and the misconception regarding the rights of husbands and fathers often confuse men facing a divorce. At Gordon & Shaw, PLC in Grand Rapids, Michigan, our lawyers provide representation for men who are dealing with divorce, custody, and support-related issues. Too many times, the assumption is that the mother obtains custody and receives support. That one-sided view is not accurate and our family law attorneys are committed to overcoming those misconceptions on your behalf. If you have any questions about our practice or the American Divorce Association for Men (ADAM), or wish to schedule an appointment, please fill out and submit the form below.
