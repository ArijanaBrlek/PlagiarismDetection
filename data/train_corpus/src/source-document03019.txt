                 STRINGED & WIND INSTRUMENTS topics
The association of physics with music is very old and deep. The "Pythagorean School" of ancient Greece were the first, probably, to recognise the relationship of notes to length of string. The "Music of the Spheres" pervaded astronomy in the late C16th . Kepler "composed" music to describe the planetary orbits and died humming these to himself. Newton invented the colour "indigo" to create a musical scale of 7 colours. (Indigo has quietly disappeared from the rainbow again these days.) The quantum mechanics of atoms closely resembles the detailed physics of sound in more complex wind instruments!
 
STRINGED INSTRUMENTS
Probably all stringed instruments can be traced in history back to the weapon, the bow. Someone realised that the "twang" of the bow string was dependant on tension of the string and thickness of the string. Amplification of this "twang" could be made with a "sound board" or hollow box nearby. The vibrations of the string are transitted to the resonance box via the bridges as well as the sound entering the box.
Contemporary electric guitars make pick up the vibrations in the air generated by the string and amplify them electronically.
 
Strings are rigidly clamped at both ends so the basic action of the string is to generate sound by the transverse vibrations of standing waves along the string causing longitudinal vibrations in the air of the same frequency.
Newton showed that wave will travel along a string with a velocity given by
    where T = tension or stretching force in the string in newtons, μ = "weightiness" of the string, the linear density or mass per unit length    kgm.v = (T/μ)1/2-1
