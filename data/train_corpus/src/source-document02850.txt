The two-and-a-half year-old network offers aspiring filmmakers and documentarians the opportunity to submit short clips and get them onto television. It also produces its own material, on everything from Nazi skinheads to the extinction of freshwater dolphins in China, and combines it all in a sort of free-wheeling, round-the-clock news mashup.
