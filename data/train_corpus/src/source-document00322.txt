“I always wanted to be a writer when I was a kid,” says .(Tennessee-Knoxville 1968) Woody Paige
The Founder of ESPN
On September 7, 1979, ESPN first went on the air at 7 p.m. ET. It was who flipped the switch, becoming the founder of the worldwide leader in sports.William “Bill” Rasmussen (DePauw 1954)
ESPN was supposed to be just a regional sports network that would broadcast Hartford Whalers and University of Connecticut games several nights a week.
Surprisingly, it was cheaper to have a 24 hour transponder on a satellite than would have been to rent a few hours air time from someone else.
Since the satellite could deliver its signal across the country, Rasmussen ditched the regional business model and switched his focus nationally. And to fill the 24 hours of broadcast time, he began broadcasting games from around the country, live and on tape delay.
Acknowledged as one of the most important figures in the development of cable television and sports media, Rasmussen was called “the father of cable sports” by .USA Today
Rasmussen was also named one of ’s “Forty for the Ages” — a listing of 40 individuals who have significantly altered and elevated the world of sports.Sports Illustrated
Paige and a neighbor would build cameras out of wooden boxes and use a kid’s printer to print newspapers and distribute them around the neighborhood.
“We would take turns playing TV anchors in front of our parents’ curtains,” he says. “We used to do radio, where one of us would be the personality and the other would be the listener.”
As Paige began his journalism career, he could not decide whether he wanted to pursue a career in newspapers, TV, or radio. “Oddly enough, I ended up with all three.”
A Reporter Is Born
Paige remembers being asked what his interests were while being a Lambda Chi Alpha pledge his freshman year at the . University of Tennessee
“All of the pledges were paired up with a brother with similar interests,” he says. “So if you were interested in going to law school, they would pair you up with someone who was on track for law school.”
“When they asked me, I said I was interested in newspapers and communications. So as a result, I was helped getting a job at the school newspaper and ended up being a disc jockey, as well and doing some campus TV.”
Paige also wrote a daily article for the university’s paper featuring humor and campus life. He would write on topics such as coming up with creative excuses for canceling a date.
“I had two dates, one Friday night and one on Saturday night. And on Thursday, both their grandmothers died. What are the chances of that?” Paige says. “I am not joking. One of the girls had four grandmothers die in the time I knew her!”
Becoming a TV Star
Following graduation, Paige ended up in Denver, Colorado, and did some talk radio and local TV. It was as a newspaper columnist though, that he started to become rather well known across the country.
From there he ultimately did shows like “” and “,” especially when they were covering high-profile stories from the Southwest, like the JonBenet Ramsey murder trial and the Oklahoma City bombing cases. Today Good Morning America
“I was more than a sports columnist, I was a journalist,” said Paige. “I covered the World Trade Center bombings. I traveled throughout the world and have done Olympics and wars and the sort.”
Paige has had a very successful career in journalism. He has won more than 100 local, state, and national awards; twice has been named one of the Top 100 journalists in the country by the ; and was voted the top sports columnist in Colorado.Washington Journalism Review

He says he enjoyed going to the British Open, Wimbledon, and the Olympics, but didn’t really enjoy people from other countries getting mad at him.
“I went to France for the Albertville Olympics and wrote that the German hockey team got off the plane and France surrendered,” he laughs. “I didn’t realize that there were so many French people in the country.”
ESPN Comes Calling
When the president of courted Paige to move to New York and work full time for the network, he was surprised. “Sports is a vehicle,” says Paige. “My love is writing.” ESPN
He told the network that they didn’t want to hire him because he doesn’t live and die sports. “The ESPN president told me that they had hundreds of people that live and die sports and what they really needed was someone to be creative, funny, and different,” he says.
ESPN began using Paige on a number of different programs and eventually created a program just for him.
“” was created just for Paige, and when it became hugely successful, ESPN wanted him to do more shows. Around the Horn

“I am on national TV 6.5 hours a day, which is stunning to me,” Paige says. “I always wondered what kind of talent Regis Philbin has, and now I found out for I am kind of like him — I have no redeeming social talent.”
People always ask Paige how he got his job. “I say, wait 40 years and become an overnight success.”
Fraternity Influence
Paige’s Keynote Address
Woody Paige gave a keynote speech to 650 brothers and friends at the 51st General Assembly. At the conclusion of his speech, Executive Vice President Bill Farkas presented Paige the Order of Achievement award.
Paige says he values the time he spent with Lambda Chi Alpha. He believes it helped build character and has the ability to shape people who they are at an older age.
“Your family and your religion set the values foundation for you,” Paige says. “The fraternity serves a third part of the foundation because it teaches so many value systems that make you who you are today.”
He stays in contact with 15 to 20 brothers he went to school with and sees it as a microcosm of the fraternity as a whole. The brothers all learned the same values from Lambda Chi Alpha to get where they are today.
“There is something to be said because no one I know robbed banks or were part of Enron stealing people’s money,” he says.
Paige went back to the University of Tennessee to speak at the School of Journalism 25th anniversary. He decided to walk over to fraternity house, which he hadn’t done in a number of years.
“I saw this guy I went to school with and I thought he was going to come up to me like everyone and say ‘I see you on TV.’ Instead, he said, ‘Woody Paige, did you ever find a job?’ It was at that point, I knew I would always stay humble.”
