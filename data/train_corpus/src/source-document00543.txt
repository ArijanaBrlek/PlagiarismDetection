Need to keep mature talent in your workforce? Consider telecommuting
 
Are you prepared for the predicted scarcity of qualified workers? As the proportion of younger workers continues to decline, your company’s ability to successfully attract and retain mature, experienced workers may be more critical than ever. And telecommuting may be the solution.
 
Older workers are becoming an increasingly important part of Connecticut’s workforce and offering t elecommuting can be a valuable option to help keep your workforce filled with experienced and capable employees. In fact, research by AARP shows that many baby boomers would defer retirement if they had more flexibility in their schedules.
 
By 2014, it’s estimated nearly one-third of the total U.S. workforce (32%) will be 50 or older. These highly skilled workers can positively impact your bottom line. Generally, they:
Possess a well-documented track record of positive performance
Are knowledgeable and have maintained their skills to remain competitive
Tend to remain on the job nearly twice as long as younger workers 
Have better attendance records than younger workers
 
Telecommuting is a good option to consider because employers with telecommute programs (1) attract the best and brightest candidates to the hardest-to-fill jobs, (2) reduce the cost and time of recruiting and retraining replacements and (3) help employees achieve work/life balance and reduces their costs and stress.
