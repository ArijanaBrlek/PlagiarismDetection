What's New on HD Theater
Take a look at some of the new original programming currently airing on HD Theater. Don't see what you're looking for? Saturdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT The cars are the stars and it's the excitement and energy of live auction action, the chant of the auctioneer calling the bids, and the ring men working the crowd that will draw you in to this new show. In early '08 Mecum Auctions will sell their 50,000 car. Mecum sells more cars every year than any other auction company. Find out why! Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT Wayne Carini, a Connecticut-based Ferrari expert and master restorer, scours the countryside in search of classic automobiles that have been hidden away in barns and shacks for 60+ years. Follow these cars from their unearthing to the auction block. World Premiere Sunday July 6 at 8 p.m. ET/PT Shopping malls, once a peculiarly American symbol of convenience and excess, now dot the global landscape. The pint-size Arab Emirate of Dubai, sometimes known as the Oz of malls, clocked 88.5 million mall visitors each year; nearly 180 million Brazilians mob shopping malls every month-almost as many as in the United States. And no one can keep pace with China, where foreign investors are scrambling to get a piece of a real estate boom driven in part by mall mania.
