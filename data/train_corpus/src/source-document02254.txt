Â— The Denver Post violated its agreement with Rocky owner E.W. Scripps when it borrowed $13 million from their jointly owned operating agency to cover The Post's newsroom payroll, Scripps wrote in a letter to Post executives last month.DENVER
"We request that this practice cease and that the Post find a way to fund its editorial payroll without resorting to this . . .," Scripps executives Rich Boehne and Mark Contreras wrote.
The letter was dated Dec. 9, five days after Scripps announced it would sell the Rocky and would pursue other options, including closure, if it couldn't find a buyer.
"We continue to reserve our rights to pursue remedies for the several breaches caused by these practices or to assert them in connection with any future legal proceedings," they added in the letter sent to top Post executives Dean Singleton and Joseph "Jody" Lodovic.
The letter also reveals that the agency's credit has dried up and the banks will not lend it any more money. And it says that Scripps does not believe that The Post is able to repay the borrowed money "promptly."
