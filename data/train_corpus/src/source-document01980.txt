Hi everyone - the fact of the matter is that Web followers tend to be less than attentive to their own wellbeing.
Following on from some light-hearted banter between myself and Robert Scoble a few months back - I thought I'd take the opportunity of my attendance at o2con to suggest a casual early morning jog for conference attendees on the two days of the main conference.
Robert has indicated his keeness (maybe not so much keen as preparedness) to come join in - so calling all other like minded conference goers to come join in for a quite San Fran jog - starting point and route TBC - leave a comment if you're keen (or could be convinced!)
