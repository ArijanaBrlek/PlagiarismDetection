Connecticut's plan to pave 375 new miles of road with a concrete base -- much better quality than the existing pavement. The six trunk lines were not signed, but did have numbers. Includes map. 1913 Trunk Line system
This is why Routes 8, 10, 12, and 32 go north-south and cross into many other states; they were part of a New England-wide road network set up in the early 1920s. New England Interstates

In the early 1960s, the state reorganized its highway system, transferring several routes between town and state control. About 1/3 of all routes were affected. The Small Renumbering
In 1948, the state began experimenting with color-coded route markers in cities: each through route would have its own color, to aid in navigation. Color-coded Route Markers
Maps
Connecticut highways have evolved a lot over the past 70 years; so have the road maps. I discuss the changes in style and format, and include scans of several maps: not just the covers, but the roads too! The Map Inside: The Connecticut Officials

Route Numbering
State routes are numbered between 2 and 999; however, those above 399 are routes, maintained by the state but not signposted. Connecticut does not allow a state route with the same number as a US or Interstate route. "Secret"
The highest signed route is 372; the highest secret route, 919. (The highest route ever appears to be SR 950 in East Granby, in the 1940s).

Short History
Connecticut started numbering its highways around 1922, predating the US route system's inauguration in 1926. The route numbers in were almost completely different from those today. the 1920s
In response to changing laws for federal highway aid, the state in 1932 renumbered most of its highways, creating many routes (such as 67, 58, and 87) you would recognize today. Throughout the 1930s, 40s and 50s there were scattered changes. Along with the signed routes was a system of unposted "secret" routes, with administrative numbers reaching into the 900s.
In 1961 the state decided to re-examine its highway system, and reclassified hundreds of miles of roads. Some state routes were deleted (turned over to the town), some created, and many renumbered. Most signed routes above 220 are a product of this reclassification. The state's secret routes were renumbered into a geographically grouped system; for example, routes in Eastern Connecticut were numbered in the 600s.
Recent highway projects completed in Connecticut include (1994) and an improved (1996). Interstate 291 Route 2A
The Future
The days of new freeways are over; we won't see any of the ambitious 1960s plans revived any time soon. A few projects remain on the books: completing ; improving and ; spot improvements on ; a new Q-Bridge on I-95 in New Haven; and upgrades to I-84 in Waterbury - Southington and Danbury. Route 11 US 7 Route 25 I-95
An extension of and a bypass for southeastern Route 2 are also proposed. Route 2A
