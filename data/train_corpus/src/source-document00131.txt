Dinosaur Confusion© Cutwork Applique Vest Pattern
Dinosaur Fun for Kids
Join in the jurassic revival with this adorable child's vest pattern. Our dinosaurs tails interweave around each other like a puzzle. You'll find them walking all over each other, standing on hills, and watching over dinosaur eggs. Watch our showing you just how easy these vests are to make! .Dinosaur Confusion video demonstration Sewing Skill Level 2
 
The pattern includes:
• Seven different dinosaurs • Dinosaur eggs • Multiple leaf shapes and sizes • Mountains and hills • 'Jagged' yokes • Vest pattern pieces • Full instructions • Child sizes 8-14 included
 
The vest also worked up beautifully when made out of a heavy-weight denim; we didn't even use batting. Dinosaur Confusion
You may see the denim version in the farthest left side model in the photograph.
