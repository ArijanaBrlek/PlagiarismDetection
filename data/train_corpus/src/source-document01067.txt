Doris Christopher founded The Pampered Chef (US) in 1980. As a home economist and educator, she used and demonstrated functional, high-quality kitchen tools and equipment. Often the tools available in local stores were not of the quality available to her as a professional. Many products were not well designed, salespeople were often uninformed and information included with the products was inadequate. Doris' recognition of the need for quality products with complete information grew into The Pampered Chef. The home was a natural setting for the "show and tell" method of selling these products. Customers could see how the products worked, try them out and even taste the results. The home demonstration method of selling also gave Doris a flexible work schedule, allowing a balance between career and family responsibilities. The Pampered Chef had a modest beginning, with Doris' home in Chicago serving as the office and warehouse. By the end of the first full year, the sales force had grown to 12, with sales over $50,000 (US). In 1987, sales exceeded the $1 million (US) mark, and today, sales are over $700 (US) million in the United States alone. We anticipate the continuation of this incredible growth over the next several years. In September of 1999, The Pampered Chef launched its business in the United Kingdom, extending Doris' mission of preserving family mealtime. Consultants and customers across the country soon embraced the company, its high-quality kitchen tools and the impeccable service it provides. There are now hundreds of Consultants presenting Shows in the United Kingdom, with more Consultants starting their own Pampered Chef businesses every day. From its inception, the company has been committed to fostering entrepreneurship. Today, The Pampered Chef is a rapidly expanding, multimillion dollar enterprise with more than 71,000 independent Kitchen Consultants across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany and a reputation as the premier direct seller of high-quality kitchen tools.
