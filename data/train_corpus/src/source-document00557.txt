Diet Tips when visiting Starbucks Coffee:
The fancier the drink, the fancier the calories - especially when you opt for the whipped topping.  On average, the whipped topping will cost about 130 calories.
Most of Starbucks Coffee 'flavoring' additives contain 70 OR more calories per shot - so go for the sugar free varieties to save calories.
WHENEVER you are calculating 'milk' calories, remember that skim milk contains about 80 calories per cup, low fat milk contains 120 calories per cup and whole milk contains 160 calories per cup. Each are separated by 40 calories as we move up the scale from skim to whole.
NOTE:  Starbucks is a trademark.
