About Team Battelle
Team Battelle is a staff-driven, decentralized volunteer program, which includes Battelle staff members, their families and retirees. Project ideas are brought forth by staff members and reviewed by the Team Battelle Advisory Committee for adoption into the program. A staff member, known as the "project director" coordinates each project. The project director serves as a liaison between Battelle staff and the agency. Team Battelle projects are selected from areas representing our corporate citizenship prioritiesâ€”Arts & Culture; Civic & Community; Education; and Health & Human Services. The activities maybe ongoing or short-term, one-time event projects. And, there is a modest budget to support necessary expenses for each project.
The mission of the Team Battelle Volunteer Program is:
"To positively impact the quality of life in communities where Battelle staff live and work by supporting and initiating volunteer-driven programs and activities that meet the community's needs, capitalize on staff's interests, and are consistent with Battelle's corporate citizenship priorities."
