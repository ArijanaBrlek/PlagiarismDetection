A new analysis of the 10% income tax rate cut proposed by House and Senate leaders shows that the plan would reduce federal revenues by more than a trillion dollars over the next decade. The analysis also shows that 62% of the proposed tax cuts would go to the best-off tenth of all taxpayers. The computer analysis of the proposed 10% income tax rate reduction was released by Citizens for Tax Justice, a non-partisan, non-profit group that favors fairer tax policies. The analysis also found: "The proposed 10% income tax rate cut is billed as an even-handed tax cut, but that's not the case at all," noted CTJ director Robert S. McIntyre. "In fact, this plan would reduce the federal government's most progressive tax, the income tax, while leaving other, generally regressive taxes in place. That approach, by definition, has to favor the best-off taxpayers at the expense of everyone else."
