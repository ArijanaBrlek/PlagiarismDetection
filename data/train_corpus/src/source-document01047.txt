[] edit Safety Division
The VSP Safety Division consists of two sections; the and the Unit. There are seven area offices, one located in each field Division.Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection ProgramMotor Carrier Safety
Area 61 - Richmond
Area 67 - Fairfax
Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program
The purpose of the program and the inspection itself is so that vehicles operating on the highways of Virginia meet minimum safety requirements, thus reducing crashes due to defective equipment. This section investigates inspection complaints, monitors all inspection stations, conducts examinations for inspectors and provides inspection materials (manuals / stickers) for the licensed stations.
As of December 31, 2006, there were 4,235 active inspection stations located throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 14,308 licensed safety inspectors who performed approximately 7,792,000 inspections at appointed stations during 2006. Approximately 24% (1,910,000 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components.
Motor Carrier Safety Unit
The motor carrier safety and hazardous materials units were created in 1982. In 1995 the Motor Carrier Safety Unit was made a part of the Safety Division.
The department's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety requirements on Virginia highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training seminars.
Motor Carrier Safety teams respond to hazardous material spills or incidents and conduct post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents.
Data indicates that during 2006, Troopers conducted 40,730 in-depth inspections on heavy commercial vehicles and 9,588 of these, or 23.5 percent, were placed out of service for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of hazardous materials. [15]
[] edit Commercial Vehicle Enforcement
In 1982 Inspectors from the Department of Motor Vehicles were transferred to the Department of State Police and received training at the State Police Academy. After 12 weeks of instruction and graduation, Weight Enforcement Officers (WEO) were assigned to the 11 weigh stations across the state for the purpose of enforcing commercial vehicle laws. These WEO's were the precursor positions to CVEO's.
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers (CVEO) whose primary responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. During 2004, approximately 16.2 million commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for inspection. Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 73,038 summonses and made 303 criminal arrests. This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway safety program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized vehicles; through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. [16]
[] edit Crime Prevention
THe VSP provides specialized training to selected troopers throughout the State in crime prevention and personal safety. Participating troopers receive training in "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED), business security and techniques to promote personal safety. All training is part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enables troopers to achieve certification through the Department of Criminal Justice Services as crime prevention specialists. [17]
[] edit Motorist Assistance Program
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the VSP currently operates in the four largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake, Fairfax, Richmond and in the Roanoke/Salem areas.
State Police motorist assistance aides provide services such as fixing flat tires, providing gasoline, jump-starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family members of a stranded motorist's situation. Motorist Assistance Aides also were instrumental in the arrest of drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting erratic driving behavior to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension. [18]
[] edit Specialty Teams
Each of the seven field divisions deploys tactical teams, canine teams and SCUBA teams. These teams are available 24 hours a day to assist local law enforcement agencies or State Police personnel. Tactical teams assist in the execution of high-risk search or arrest warrants and in dealing with hostage situations. Canine teams are available to track lost persons or fugitives, search for suspects of crimes, and detect illegal drugs, explosives, or accelerants used in arsons. SCUBA teams are used to recover drowning victims, conduct swift water rescues, or search for evidence of criminal activity. Troopers apply for specialties and are selected by supervisors in those programs. Troopers who are selected for specialties receive no extra compensation.
Canine Program
In 1961 the canine program was instituted to afford the State Police and all enforcement agencies the tracking abilities of German shepherd dogs. One trooper and canine were assigned to each State Police division. In 1988 the Department initiated narcotic canine and handler training for Department personnel and local police agencies.
Canine Teams are available to track lost persons or fugitives, search for suspects, and detect illegal drugs, explosives or accelerants used in arsons. At the present time, there are two canine training facilities operated by the Department. The first is located at the Training Academy in Richmond and the second is located at the Abingdon Regional Jail in Washington County.
The VSP trains selected troopers to become Canine Handlers in one of five areas.
Patrol and Apprehension (As of 2006 there are 13 Patrol Canine Teams)
Narcotics Detection (As of 2006 there are 19 Narcotics Canine Teams)
Explosive and Weapons Detection (As of 2006 there are 19 Explosives Canine Teams)
Accelerant Detection (As of 2006 there are 2 Accelerant Canine Teams)
Search and Rescue (The VSP currently has 1 Bloodhound located centrally in the state)
Throughout the programs history several types of canines have been utilized. Rottweiler's, German Shepherd's, Labrador Retriever's, Belgian Malinois's and the recent addition of a Bloodhound have been used for specific duties. The VSP trains their canines in one area and does not cross train.
Tactical Team Program
Within each of the seven State Police field divisions, a Tactical Operation Team is maintained. These teams are available to assist local agencies and other State Police members in the arrest and apprehension of individuals known to pose a threat to law enforcement officials and in other situations where there is a risk to police officer safety.
SCUBA Program
In 1962 the State Police began training and equipping troopers with . Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) allowed troopers to search for victims of drowning or homicide, discarded firearms or evidence. SCUBA equipment
The department s Search and Recovery Team (SART) conducts search and recovery and rescue operations throughout Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, assisting both state and local agencies.

The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004. The SSD is responsible for the law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns and insurance industry outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) and Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.). The Bomb, Arson and Drug Diversion units also make up the SSD as well as the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI). The SSD provides technical, training and financial management support for these units. [22]
The H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free telephone hotlines are administered and maintained by the SSD. Initial notifications of suspected insurance fraud and auto theft activities are received via the SSD hotlines, Web sites, e-mails, faxes and phone calls. The notifications are reviewed and distributed to the appropriate local law enforcement agencies or to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation s field offices where investigations are conducted by the Department s special agents on a case-by-case basis.
