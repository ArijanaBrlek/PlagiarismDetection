The Human Skeletal System - Home Page
 
  This cheerful little fellow identifies the major parts of the human skeletal system.  We have so many things to help you that we've divided the Skeletal System into sections:    
- Bone Model Shows the structure of bones.    
- Skulls What's inside the head.  One of the largest selections anywhere.
    Skeletons - Models of the entire skeleton.  Everything from budget starters to highly specialized and detailed models.    
- Spine & Vertebrae Many models to choose from.  Be sure to check out related subjects in the Nervous System.    
- Extremities & Joints  Here you will find the bones of the arms, legs, shoulders, elbows, ankles, wrists and hips.  If you are interested in joints that also have muscles, then see our Muscled Joints under the Muscular System.     
- Real Human Bones Yes, we have real Skulls and Skeletons.  And, no, we don't get them from Igor in Transylvania.
