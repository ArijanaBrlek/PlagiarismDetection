Congratulations to the management on the recent refurbishment of . They had done an excellent job in creating a new ambience to the hotel. I love the simple lines in the elegant accomodation which bring a more spacious outlook to the rooms. With 32 inches plasma TV, soothing rain shower, free internet and free minibar, this hotel is an excellent address for world and business travellers to make you feel at home. Royal Plaza on Scotts
The concept at Carousel dining place is excellent. It brings the flair of Paris into the heart of the hotel with Asian and Mediterranean food to whet your appetite. I love the vogue colour of Carousel and cullery brings simple dining into faboulous.
Heat Louge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner, just chilling…
