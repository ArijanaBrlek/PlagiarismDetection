HBCyber News and Reviews is a monthly column published since 1995 for parents, teachers and small business and home business owners offering articles on some of the best computer products available.  I cover business software, education, entertainment with freeware and shareware, and some hardware too.  Over the years, I've reviewed computer programs from Microsoft, Knowledge Adventure (Davidson) and others.  When my kids were young, they couldn't wait for the software to arrive and have fun testing the games and lessons with me.  And, in the past few years they've contributed some of their own reviews with opinions.  The best advice on software is from the children who use it.  Also, many of the business programs reviewed are useful for home business and small business owners.
