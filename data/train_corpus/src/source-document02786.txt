farmers' markets all California Grown Farmers' Market Seasonal Calendar
This week's featured product is Kiwifruit.
Originally called Chinese Gooseberries, these fuzzy Chinese natives were transplanted to New Zealand by missionaries in the early 1900s and have since migrated to California, where they have flourished just like their vitamin C-rich cousins, citrus. For a quick healthy snack, cut a kiwi in half and scoop out the green flesh and black seeds. Or peel, chop, and add to any salad. Or top chicken or fish with a fresh kiwifruit salsa. Since kiwifruit contains acids that are natural tenderizers once exposed to the air, be sure to cut it right before eating and add it last to fruit salsas. Its unique flavor will add character and color to dishes.

As a general rule, PCFMA does not provide space for jewelry, crafts or other non-agricultural or non-food items in its markets. However, a limited amount of space may be available at the Saturday markets in Vallejo, Vacaville and Tracy for local artisans wishing to sell crafts of their own design and creation.
