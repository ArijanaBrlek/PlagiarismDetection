Smooth Elliptical Cross Trainers
Smooth elliptical cross trainers are designed with a 3-1 ratio of lower body resistance to upper body resistance. This matches the body's normal ratio of muscle mass of upper to lower body. Over time, the user will fatigue equally with all four limbs, which is critical for longer fat burning workout programs.
Contrast this to an elliptical exercise machine designed with equal resistance for upper and lower body. Over a 30 minute workout, your arms will feel strained while your legs are hardly noticing any work.
As with their treadmills, Smooth elliptical cross trainers are solidly built, have an excellent service track record, and hence have developed a sound reputation for quality . "Epinion" readers have given the Smooth CE a 5 Star rating.
Smooth elliptical exercise machines sell in the mid-price range, and are definately a "Best Buy".
