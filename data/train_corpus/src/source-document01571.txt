Product stewardship commitment
Under the Vinyl Council of Australia Product Stewardship Commitment, 33 companies in the Australian industry have committed to address the health and environmental concerns associated with the manufacture, use and disposal of their products. This agreement was developed by the industry in cooperation with the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (then known as Environment Australia) and endorsed by David Kemp, the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage in October 2002.

The Department commissioned ExcelPlas Polymer Technology to identify and characterise:

the main impediments to addressing the environmental issues and impacts; and
possible approaches and key characteristics of solutions to address each issue or impact.
The ExcelPlas report identifies the range, quantities and life expectancies of the major products and applications. It identifies current producers and suppliers of products and additives in Australia, and the origin of these products and additives where they are imported. The report also identifies and characterises the end of life environmental issues and impacts relating to , including leaving the product in situ, mechanical recycling, landfilling, incineration and waste to energy conversion.
