In July 2006, Chief Administrator Dr. Maxine Kilcrease established the agency’s formal commitment to cultural competence and led the agency on an exciting journey. Her objective was to create an environment in which the diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives of all employees could be used to better serve our districts. Since then, we have continuously worked to implement our equity plan. At Heartland AEA, we will continue to make diversity a key component of our culture.How We Embrace Diversity
