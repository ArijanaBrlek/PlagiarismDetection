Avoid Paid Survey Scams
Tuesday, August 8th, 2006
You can earn a lot of money and have fun just for giving your opinion. BUT, you must be aware of the many scams online.Signing up to all paid surveys companies without knowing which ones are legitimate is risky. There are many paid survey scams on the web that won’t pay you for the surveys you take and that will not respect your privacy. You won’t be paid for your time and you could be bombarded with unwanted ads.
SO, how do you determine which paid surveys are legitimate and which ones are scams?
Legitimate paid surveys companies comply with the following business practices:
- Your privacy and the privacy of your answers will be respected.
- Your name, address, phone number, personal information, or individual responses won’t be disclosed to anyone outside the research industry without your permission.
- You will not be sold anything, or asked for money, under the disguise of research.
- Your decision to participate in a study, answer specific questions, or discontinue your participation will be respected without question.
- You will be paid on time for the surveys you decide to take.
Typical paid survey scams act as following:
- They try to sell you something in exchange for a promise ofgreat rewards.
- There is never any support when you need help.
- The Terms & Conditions of these companies (in very little writing on the bottom of their web sites) state they can sell or distribute your personal information without asking any further permission.
If you really want to make money taking paid surveys, you must join only legitimate companies. The problem is that it takes too much time to examine the reputation of these companies and to read their terms and conditions. Instead of taking surveys and getting paid for your opinion, you will spend most of your time searching for the legitimate ones.
We recommend that you join a professional paid survey database program that gives access to a big collection of legitimate market research companies. All the hard work was done for you and you can immediately start registering to companies that will really pay for your opinion. Yes, these database programs charge a one-time subscription fee, but this fee is usually recovered after your first 1 or 2 surveys.
You must also be careful about which paid survey database program you join. We highly recommend the following: and . Survey Scout Maximum Paid Surveys
