Elliptical Trainers
Fitness ellipticals are of the highest quality. The down side of the Life Fitness ellipticals is the warranties could be better for the price you are paying. The last model mentioned the Life Fitness Sport Model gives you a lifetime warranty on the frame, two years on the parts, and one year on the labor. All the other models mentioned above have the same warranty, lifetime on the frame, two years on the parts, and one year on the labor. The Life Fitness ellipticals X3, and X3i, are at the lower end of the six models. They are built very durable and are under three thousand dollars. The X3i has four more programs than the X3 and is slightly better. The Life Fitness X5, and the Life Fitness X5i, have something called the Select Stride, which means that you can select from four different settings, sprint, run, jog, and walk. These ellipticals may last a lifetime, they are built that well. They are amoung the heaviest ellipticals made, so after they are put together, don't plan on moving them often. The Life Fitness X9i has eighteen programs and seven personal programs. The quality is said to be that of a commercial gym machine. This is one of the absolute best elliptical that money can buy. These ellipticals are quiet and very stable units. The last model, the Life Fitness Elliptical Sports Cardio SX30 is at the lowest end that the Life Firness company makes. It is an average elliptical trainer at best and so if you are considering this model you may also want to check out other competitive makes. All things considered it's hard to top the quality and value of Life Fitness Ellipticals.
