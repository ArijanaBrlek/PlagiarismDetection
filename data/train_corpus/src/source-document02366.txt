I will make the final comic available online in pdf format and sell copies of the comic anime conventions.

Email whatever to ninjaconsultant@gmail.com The tentative deadline is August 1st, 2006. Help get the word out by re-posting this, cross-posting it, emailing it, or whatever way you want without being too annoying and spamming people.
