Major William Simpson Dunlop, commanded the sharpshooter battalion which was formed from, and served with, the fine old South Carolina brigade which had been commanded first by  Gregg and then by Samuel McGowan. Each of the five regiments in the brigade--1st, 12th, 13th, and 14th Infantry and Orr Riflesontributed about three dozen men to the new battalion."Captain William S. Dunlop of the 12th South Carolina Infantry Regiment permanently revitalized the Battalion in 1864.  The battalion continued to serve the Army of Northern Virginia until Captain Dunlop was wounded and captured at Amelia's Courthouse during the retreat from Richmond in April 1865.  The remainder of the sharpshooters found their own way to Appomattox, many were present for the surrender; others defied surrender and silently withdrew to their homes  see .  Dunlop sought such qualities as "intelligence, sound judgment . . . marksmanship . . . unfaltering courage." The manual on rifle practice published by Cadmus Wilcox in the 1850 was used to train the men. The manual was a standard in its field. Author of the book " Lee's Sharpshooters" in 1889 detailing the experiences of the brigade from Spotsylvania through Appomattox Courthouse. As a reader progresses through Dunlop account of the 1864 operations, there dawns an awareness of the increasing competence of the sharpshooters. Already seasoned by years of war, the men became skilled and confident skirmishers. At the onset of the war last winter the sharpshooters were short of comforts and supplies, so they calmly headed out one dark night and routed a well-stocked enemy to capture what they needed . They had become Lee shock troops, situated where Dunlop subtitle put them: "At the Forefront of Battle." Veteran of Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, Hanover Junction. Petersburg, Longbridge, Fussell's Mill, Ream's station, Hatcher's Run, Southerland Station. " 3rd South Carolina

(Assistant Quartermaster) of the 26th Regiment of North Carolina Troops known as the "Chatham Independent Guards." Captain Dunlap was born in 1833 in Chatham County, N. C. He graduated from the Pennsylvania Medical College. At the outbreak of the war he was a physician in Moore County, N. C. but returned to his native county to enlist into the Chatham Independent Guards, which would become Co. E of the 26th Regiment of North Carolina. On May 28th, 1861 he was appointed as regimental Quartermaster and transferred to the Field and Staff of the regiment. His tenure in this position was short-lived as he was unable to post a bond. Due to the fact that quartermasters were held accountable for government property in their care, a financial bond was required. Dunlap was unable to comply with this requirement and resigned on February 11th, 1862. He subsequently served as a Private in Co. E (The Vance Troop) of the 5th Regiment N. C. Calvary (63rd NCT). On October 29th, 1862 he was appointed as Hospital Steward for the 5th Cavalry and transferred to the Field and Staff of that regiment. While serving in one of the field hospitals he helped treat the wounds of Col. John R. Lane of the 26th and other members of his old troop after the battle of Gettysburg. In June of 1865 he was reported as a paroled prisoner in Richmond, Va.; likely serving in one of the military hospitals in that city after its April evacuation. Dunlap resumed his medical practice in Moore County after the war; however a wartime injury caused his early death in 1867. He is buried in the Short Family Cemetery in Moore County, North Carolina.Captain Bryant Green Dunlap.

The company was organized at Trinity County Texas, and was mustered into Confederate Service at Sumter, Texas on 5 May 1862 under Captain Howard Ballenger. Crockett was wounded at Gettysburg on 2 July 1863, and again on 19 September 1863 at Chickamauga. After the second wound, his leg had to be amputated, and he was discharged from military service for disability. It is said that he was in ill health for the rest of his life. He and his wife Mary McNeil had at least one son, George Clinton Dunlap, and eight grandchildren. (Military information from "Hood's Texas Brigade: A Compendium", 1977 by Col. Harold B. Simpson, Hill Junior College Press. ISBN #912172-22-3 Library of Congress #77-91396.) Crockett's father John C. Dunlop came from Tennessee around 1834 to fight in the War for Texas Independence. He served in the Texas Volunteer Militia, 2nd Regiment, 2nd Brigade, under Capt. B.P. Hardin. (According to an acquaintance in the Sons of the Republic of Texas, the Texas Militia later became the Texas Rangers.) As a result of his service, he was given a land grant by the newly formed Republic of Texas in Trinity county, and settled there with his wife Georgia to start their family. All seven of John's children were born as Dunlap's in either the Republic of or the State of Texas. (submitted by Clan Dunlop Texas Commissioner David Dunlap)David Crockett Dunlap
