Queens Pedestrian Bridges Rated Poor And Fair
The Willow Lake (Pedestrian) Bridge in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and the 51st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge in Woodside were labeled in poor and fair condition during recent inspections by city and state inspectors who recommended replacement of the two spans.
News of the ratings came to light last week, after Governor Eliot Spitzer directed state agencies to conduct a thorough examination of 49 city bridges following the collapse of a 40-year old bridge in Minneapolis.
City and state inspectors who tagged the bridges deficient inspect every New York City bridge at least once every two years, a state DOT spokesperson said.
The two spans are among many city bridges that have been rated under what officials termed a state of the art inspection system which considers factors such as structural adequacy, safety, serviceability and function.
The Willow Lake Bridge in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which crosses over the Van Wyck Expressway at 76th Road in Kew Gardens Hills, was rated structurally poor in a recent city survey which cited concrete and underside deterioration. Officials have slated the bridge for replacement at a cost of $2.7 million.
The 51st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge, which crosses the Long Island Rail Road main line in Woodside, is also slated for replacement at a cost greater than $1 million.
Officials at the state and city Departments of Transportation (DOT) were unable to say when the bridges are slated for replacement. A state DOT spokesperson claimed work on the spans is not slated for the near future.
Queens Parks Department sources said that pedestrians need not fear crossing the Willow Lake Bridge in its current condition. Workers at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park are constantly checking and maintaining the bridge, to determine its safety, the sources said.-Liz Goff
