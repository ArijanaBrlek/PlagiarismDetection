Alexian Brothers to Open New Children’s Hospital on St. Alexius Medical Center Campus
The Alexian Brothers Hospital Network has delivered a wide range of top quality pediatric services for some time. As the communities we serve have grown in population and their medical needs have evolved, we are moving forward to build a state of the art facility to house many of these services on the campus of St Alexius in Hoffman Estates.  Named the Alexian Brothers Children’s Hospital this center will provide a medical home for the area’s children and offer our pediatricians and pediatric specialists a superior facility in which to practice. It will provide a focus for the pediatric services offered throughout the Network and signal to the community that we cherish the health and well being of their children.
