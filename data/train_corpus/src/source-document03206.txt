The Korean language existed long (don't quote me on this, but I think, at least, there is a historical reference dating back to around 400 A.D.) before the writing system. Before (and long after) its , almost all of writing was done with Chinese characters ( ). The influence of Chinese characters can be seen everywhere in the modern Korean language and society. Index

A Brief History of Hangul inventionHanJa
The Korean writing system is quite unique in that it was , relatively recently, in 1443 by (~ ) and his scholars at . It was published three years later. The system was originally known as d= , which translates to "the proper sound for teaching people". The name, Hangul ( ), is known to be coined by in 1913.inventedKing SeJongSeJongDaeWangJipHyeonJeonHunMinJeongEumHanGeulJu SiGyeong
Before this document describing the writing system was discovered in 1930s (I was never good at History), no one knew what this system was based on. Some claimed that one day looked at his "window" (before glass, thick papers were used to cover wooden frames with geometric shapes) and came up with the idea.King SeJong
However, the document describes the philosophical (i.e., / "heaven, earth and human") and physiological (e.g., shapes and locations of mouth and tongue) bases for each alphabet ( ).CheonJiInJaMo
The exact purpose of this creation has been debated for a long time. What wrote initially about it is that the Korean language and the Chinese language are different and it makes it difficult for common people to express themselves well with Chinese characters and that he created these characters so that they can be easily learned and used everyday.King SeJong
Its use didn't become popular overnight despite its ease of use. It was still a time when China had great influences over Korea in every aspect, so aristocrats and scholars kept using Hanja and despised its use. If you wanted to get ahead in life (e.g., becoming a scholar or landing a government position), one was required to learn HanJa. So, Hangul was mostly used by women and people of lower classes. It wasn't until recently, in the mid-20th century, that its use became more prevalent among people.
I think the Hanja education in the secondary schools is continuing in a way, but not much. Since the late 1980s, newspapers have started to use only Hangul. It used to have mixture of Hangul and Hanja and I remember that I often got reprimended for not being able to read newspapers well (I wasn't good with Hanja).
These days, most of the printed media use Hangul exclusively. Some did have come back to using both, especially for personal names. But for the most of the younger Koreans, Hanja isn't such a big issue in everyday life.
One last thing. Koreans used to celebrated October 9th as the Hangul Day ( ) nationally (that is, a national holiday). But about a decade ago, they canceled it citing, if I remember correctly, that we had too many holidays (whether that was the real reason, I have no idea)! Anyway, it is no longer a national holiday, but some do still remember.HanGeulLal
