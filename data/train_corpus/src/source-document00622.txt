Using an adobe contractor versus building yourself: costs of building an adobe home - page 3 of 5
 
 
You'll need to make decisions about:
- (Saltillo tile, brick on sand, flagstone, stamped and dyed concrete, carpet on slab, etc.) - (exposed sealed adobe, plastered adobe, and the type of plaster finish) -(exposed , coved ceiling, vaulted , ordinary sheet rock, etc). -plus, many, many other decisions...floors

All of these decisions lead to a set of working drawings. Will you draft them yourself, farm them out to an experienced draftsperson, or hire a contractor or architect?
Once you begin, how long will it take? An adobe contractor in Albuquerque or Tucson, can complete the average turn-key, custom adobe in four months- building one house in the spring, another in the fall, or two a year.

Not to mention the high-tech, energy-saving window units, the Mexican hand-carved entry door, or the adobe hand-shaped nichos or bancos. If your expectations are high, expect to pay more. If you can be happy with a smaller, economy adobe without all the bells and whistles, your cost can be lower- much lower. Owner builders typically cut costs by 50%.artistic expectations
Costs for owner-built projects start at a low of $55 per square foot, using salvaged and saved materials, a simple design and a few custom touches. As one adds features, a more realistic figure might be $85.
