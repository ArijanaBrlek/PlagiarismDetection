How PWI Works:
PWI counselors will pre-qualify applicants by screening for eligibility criteria.
Applicants meet with PWI counselors to develop a career plan based on skill assessments, and goal planning.
Applicants agree to complete career-oriented tasks that include: attending employment workshops, developing resumes, weekly career counseling meetings, performing independent job search, and registering with the local CTWorks Career Center.
Eligibility (must meet one):
Any individual who has a physical or mental impairment that impedes their ability to work. Individuals must provide appropriate documentation. This report must also detail how the impairment creates an impediment to employment.
An individual who has been determined eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.
PWI serves jobseekers with disabilities in over 60 towns in Southwestern and Northwestern Connecticut.
