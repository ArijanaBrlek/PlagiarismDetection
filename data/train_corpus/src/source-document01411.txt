Healthy New Year!
Weve all been on the wrong side of a New Years resolution. Faced with the guilt of too many holiday goodies or laziness induced by dark days, the turning of the calendar can be a powerful marker to turn over a new leaf. Taking the time to make your resolutions meaningful ensures that by the end of the year, they arent simply another reminder of what didnt happen.
Play it cool
Winters short days, falling temperatures and a busy social calendar can upset even the most established fitness routine. If youre struggling to show up for your workouts, it might be time to consider what makes a successful winter fitness program. A good winter program is more than just pulling out the treadmill or picking up an exercise tape. It should be personal and enjoyable. If you want to stick to your routine, think about your motivation for working out and making your workouts meet your needs. Here are some common motivators and their workout fixes.
Is your attempt at fitness good enough?
Like a lot of Americans, you may wonder how much physical activity you really need. What are the benefits of completing a full workout versus squeezing in ten minutes wherever you can find it? You may also ponder these same ideas when it comes to your children. In response to these questions, the Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control, recently issued the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
