Centennial Village - Adobe Pantry
The settlers of northeastern Colorado constructed buildings from a variety of materials, including cottonwood, stones, milled lumber, and adobe. Structures made of adobe bricks were durable and economical. With lumber scarce and expensive, Greeley's founder, Nathan Meeker, built his own 1870 home of adobe bricks and urged other settlers to do so. The Spanish used adobe in Mexico and the American southwest, while Germans living in Russia built houses, horse barns, and wagon sheds out of dried clay blocks called "kohlsteine" before immigrating to the United States.Ca 1906
In 1910 farmers living on the plains received an Extension Service bulletin which gave instructions and plans for constructing farm buildings of adobe bricks. Adobe became popular in many areas, as demonstrated by this outbuilding.
This structure was built southeast of LaSalle between 1905 and 1915 by Germans from Rlussia and used as a chicken house and pantry. It was moved to the Village in 1982.
