About Vinyl 2010
Dear Visitor,
Thank you for your interest in Vinyl 2010.  I am delighted that you have come to our website.
‘Polyvinyl chloride - PVC - is a polymer that adds comfort, safety and style to modern life.    In terms of cost-benefits it has few equals.
Vinyl 2010 is the ten-year voluntary programme on Sustainable Development by the whole PVC industry.  We have a concrete focus as set out in the European PVC Industry's Voluntary Commitment - a series of targets, projects, initiatives and research studies primarily concerning environmental protection and resource management.  To my knowledge, the programme is unique in Europe or elsewhere.
I believe you will find much of interest in this website and perhaps some surprises.  If you have questions or remarks, please do not hesitate to let us know.
Kind regards,
Jean-Pierre De Greve, Secretary General.
