Hold Your Next Event at the Eau Claire County Exposition Center!
Twenty Flexible Acres
If you need space for your event, you'll find an abundance of space at the Eau Claire County Exposition Center! The twenty acres of flat land offer plenty of parking, three multi-use buildings, a horse arena, and a main exhibit building. If your event is large, use the entire facility. Or, if you have an event that requires only part of the facility, you may use only the part you need. Bookings for the entire facility are available April 15 through October 15. The Exposition Center is an excellent location for agricultural expositions and shows, recreational and consumer vehicle shows, professional trade shows, rallies, and concerts. Wherever the participants of your meeting, show, or event are from, the Eau Claire County Expo Center is easy for them to find just off I-94 and State Highway 93. The Center's twenty plus acres of grounds offer ample parking. The versatile facilities may be used for meetings, events, concerts, or shows. Eau Claire offers a variety of lodging choices with 27 hotels plus B & Bs. Dining delights range from Italian to Japanese to Chinese to Thai to scrumptious steaks and seafood. Two malls and many interesting shops offer fun shopping. You'll find just what you want to make your meeting, show, or event a fun time on and off the Exposition Center's grounds.
