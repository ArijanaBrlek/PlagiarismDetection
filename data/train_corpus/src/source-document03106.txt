Adult butterflies, as well as caterpillars, breathe through a series of tiny openings along the sides of their bodies, called "spiracles."

Is it expensive to get started?
Extensive capital investments are not required. Attend a seminar and/or buy the books; join the free mailing lists; purchase some larvae and learn from experience. Our website, as well as our seminar, emphasize the use of recycled materials to build much of what you need.
Do I need a lot of space?
No. You don't need a greenhouse or a butterfly house. Larvae can be kept in plastic cups, adults in a hanging cage. You'll need a source of larval plants, which you might gather locally, or you might need to plant for yourself.
What kinds of butterfly are normally raised?
Monarchs and painted ladies. A majority of requests are for monarchs.
Who can do this?
Anyone with the time to attend to these critters. It is necessary to tend them daily. Unlike other kinds of farming, you use a Q-tip instead of a shovel. It's excellent work for families, or for the elderly. Watching your butterfly crop can be as relaxing as watching an aquarium.
Who is doing this now?
The primary place where butterfly farmers advertise their services is on The Butterfly Website. Click to see our sponsor list, and click on 'Butterfly Releases.' HERE
What are the biggest drawbacks?
1: The length of the selling season - temperature must be in the mid-60's or higher for a successful outdoor release. Many farmers augment this by other butterfly-related ventures, such as education in schools, or supplying butterflies in hanging cages to be displayed, but not released, at events.
2: A supply of larval host plants. Milkweed for monarchs can often be obtained from the wild or from friendly farmers, but it is necessary to check for bug sprays or infestations.
3: Governmental regulation. While we strongly endorse the many governmental regulations which seek to protect butterflies and agricultural products, wading through this morass, without the assistance of experienced people to guide you, can be a problem. Fortunately, the exists to help with this and other problems. These must be considered primarly in inter-state shipment of butterflies. International Butterfly Breeders Association
4: Shipping. Unless you are dealing exclusively in your local area (which is certainly feasible in any of the 'wedding capitals'), you must master the art of packaging and shipping live insects, with an eye to long shipment delays, excessive temperatures, and recipients not available to receive their butterflies.
Can I make a good living doing this?
As with every other business, it depends on the level of effort you're willing to put into it. Many people are doing it on a part-time business for extra income. Some have made it into a full-time business, but there is a seasonality to the business, so the answer depends heavily on where you reside. Since we cannot answer this question fully, we suggest you go the the mailing list described above and ask this question of the people on the list. Also, we suggest you visit the since this is the main gathering place for people in the business. IBBA website
