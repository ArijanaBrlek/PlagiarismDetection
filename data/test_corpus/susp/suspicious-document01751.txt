For instance, many long-path tornadoes mostly occurred in environments of interaction with synoptic-scale boundary (such as a front or stationary front), many short-path to occur in proximity.

Cumulous coma will not create tornadoes, because they dissipate energy, and they fall too low air. This happen when hot, humid hitting colder air.

In spite in fatality, several events during late 1990s show significant risk. When potent or violent

There are lessons to be conditioned from these events for further mitigation of damage in casualties.  This arms the forecaster to the potential for severe developments, and enables him or her to confidence when presented with radar signatures and spotter.
