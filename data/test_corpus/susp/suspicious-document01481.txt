The following quote comes from the manual of a classic computer wargame:-
'The scenario starts with the Germans ready to launch another 48th Panzer Korps counter-attack. Both sides have received substantial replacements and reinforcements. The map indicates the at-start Korps/Army locations and their historic axis of advance'.
What is the name of the game, what company produced it and who designed it?
What are the title and publisher of the current game? This you have to recognise from scans of two map sections and two sets of units on the homepage. Grognard Challenge Web-Grognards Rules of the 4CDs Challenge
