belong to the particle family and are formed from the degradation of . IDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins (, , IDL, , ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. Each native IDL particle consists of protein that encircles various fatty acids; enabling, as a water soluble particle, these fatty acids to travel in the aqueous environment as part of the fat transport system within the body. Their size is generally 25 to 35 nm in diameter and they primarily contain a range of and . They are cleared from the into the by , or further degraded to form particles.Intermediate-density lipoproteins lipoprotein very low-density lipoproteins chylomicrons VLDL LDL HDL blood triacylglycerols cholesterol esters plasma liver receptor-mediated endocytosis LDL
Generally, IDL, somewhat similar to (LDL), transports a variety of triglyceride fats and cholesterol and, like LDL, can also promote the growth of . low-density lipoprotein atheroma
