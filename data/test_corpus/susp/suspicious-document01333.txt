The designation DC-4 was first used by Douglas Aircraft Company when developing a large, four-engined type to complement its very successful , already in widespread operation. It was intended to fulfil ' requirement for a long-range passenger airliner. Retrospectively this aircraft became known as the (E for experimental). It emerged as a 42-passenger airliner with a of unusually wide cross-section for its day with two decks and a triple fin , similar to that later used by on its .

The sponsoring airlines, and United, decided to ask instead for a smaller and simpler derivative but before the definitive DC-4 could enter service the outbreak of the Second World War meant production was channeled to the and the type was given the military designation .

Douglas continued to develop the type during the war in preparation for a return to airline services when peace returned. However, the type's sales prospects were hit by the offloading of 500 wartime C-54s and R5Ds onto the civil market. DC-4s were a favorite of such as Great Lakes Airlines, North American Airlines, Universal Airlines, Transocean Airlines, etc. In the 1950s, Transocean Airlines (Oakland, California) was the largest operator of the DC-4. charter airlines

- Starting in 1959, 21 DC-4s and C-54s found new life as ATL-98 Carvairs. The Carvair was designed to carry 22 passengers and 5 automobiles. This was accomplished by extending the fuselage, moving the cockpit above the fuselage, adding a side-opening nose, and enlarging the to offset the larger forward fuselage. These planes served as flying ferries well into the seventies, and two are still airworthy as of March 2008 - one each in and South Africa.
