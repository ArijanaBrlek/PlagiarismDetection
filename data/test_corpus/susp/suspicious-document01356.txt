The of the Sun is considered to extend from the center to about 0.2 solar radii. It has a density of up to 150,000 kg/m (150 times the density of water on Earth) and a temperature of close to 13,600,000 (by contrast, the surface of the Sun is around 5,800 kelvins). Recent analysis of mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone. Through most of the Sun's life, energy is produced by through a series of steps called the ; this process converts hydrogen into helium. The core is the only location in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of heat via fusion: the rest of the star is heated by energy that is transferred outward from the core. All of the energy produced by fusion in the core must travel through many successive layers to the solar photosphere before it escapes into space as sunlight or of particles. core 3 kelvins SOHO [37] nuclear fusion p p (proton proton) chain kinetic energy
About 3.4 10 (hydrogen nuclei) are converted into helium nuclei every second (out of ~8.9 10 total amount of free protons in the Sun), releasing energy at the matter energy conversion rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second, 383 (3.83 10 W) or 9.15 10 of per second. This actually corresponds to a surprisingly low rate of energy production in the Sun's core about 0.3 W/m (watts per cubic meter). This is less power than generated by a candle. Power density is about 6 W/kg of matter. For comparison, the human body produces heat at approximately the rate 1.2 W/kg, roughly a million times greater per unit mass. The use of plasma with similar parameters for energy production on Earth would be completely impractical even a modest 1 GW fusion power plant would require about 170 billion metric ton of plasma occupying almost one cubic mile. Hence, terrestrial fusion reactors utilize far higher plasma temperatures than those in Sun's interior.38 protons 56 yotta watts 2610 megatons TNT 3
The rate of nuclear fusion depends strongly on density and temperature, so the fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and slightly against the of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate and correcting the ; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level. expand weight perturbation
The high-energy (gamma rays) released in reactions are absorbed in only a few millimeters of solar plasma and then re-emitted again in random direction (and at slightly lower energy) so it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface.

After a final trip through the convective outer layer to the transparent "surface" of the photosphere, the photons escape as . Each gamma ray in the Sun's core is converted into several million visible light photons before escaping into space. are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were by a factor of 3.

Radiative zone
From about 0.2 to about 0.7 solar radii, solar material is hot and dense enough that is sufficient to transfer the intense heat of the core outward. In this zone there is no thermal ; while the material grows cooler as altitude increases, this is less than the value of and hence cannot drive convection. Heat is transferred by of and emit , which travel a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. In this way energy makes its way very slowly (see above) outward. thermal radiation convection temperature gradient adiabatic lapse rate radiation ions hydrogen helium photons
Between the radiative zone and the convection zone is a transition layer called the . This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear a condition where successive vertical layers slide past one another. tachocline
Convection zone
In the Sun's outer layer (down to approximately 70% of the solar radius), the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. As a result, thermal convection occurs as carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone. is thought to occur at the base of the convection zone, carrying turbulent downflows into the outer layers of the radiative zone. thermal columns Convective overshoot
The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun, in the form of the and . The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior gives rise to a "small-scale" dynamo that produces magnetic north and south poles all over the surface of the Sun. solar granulation supergranulation

The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with atoms to produce H ions. The photosphere is actually tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly less opaque than on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as . Sunlight has approximately a spectrum that indicates its temperature is about 6,000 , interspersed with atomic from the tenuous layers above the photosphere.

Chemical composition
The Sun is composed primarily of the and ; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called in astronomy, account for less than 2 percent of the mass. The most abundant metals are oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%). chemical elements hydrogen helium [45] metals [46]
The Sun inherited its chemical composition from the out of which it formed: the hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by . The metals were produced by in generations of stars which completed their and returned their material to the interstellar medium prior to the formation of the Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, the helium and heavy elements have settled out of the photosphere. Therefore, the photosphere now contains slightly less helium and only 84% of the heavy elements than the protostellar Sun did; the protostellar Sun was 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals. interstellar medium Big Bang nucleosynthesis stellar nucleosynthesis stellar evolution [47] [48] [45] [49]
In the inner portions of the Sun, nuclear fusion has modified the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost portion of the Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the metal abundance unchanged. Because the interior of the Sun is radiative, not convective (see above), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere. Structure [50]
The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and thus not affected by settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well. spectroscopy meteorites [11]

Although significant research was done, the abundance determination of some iron group elements (eg and ) was still difficult at least as far as 1978 because of their hyperfine structures. iron group [51] [52] cobalt manganese [51]
The first largely complete set of of singly-ionised iron group elements were made available first in the 1960s, and improved oscillator strengths were computed in 1976. In 1978 the abundances of elements of the iron group were derived. oscillator strengths [53] [54] singly-ionised [51]

When observing the Sun with appropriate filtration, the most immediately visible features are usually its , which are well-defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because of lower temperatures. Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface. The magnetic field gives rise to strong heating in the corona, forming that are the source of intense and .

The number of sunspots visible on the Sun is not constant, but varies over an 11-year cycle known as the . At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none at all can be seen. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the sunspot cycle progresses, the number of sunspots increases and they move closer to the equator of the Sun, a phenomenon described by . Sunspots usually exist as pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarity of the leading sunspot alternates every solar cycle, so that it will be a north magnetic pole in one solar cycle and a south magnetic pole in the next. solar cycle Sp rer's law
History of the number of observed sunspots during the last 250 years, which shows the ~11-year solar cycle
The solar cycle has a great influence on , and is a significant influence on the Earth's climate . Solar activity minima tend to be correlated with colder temperatures, and longer than average solar cycles tend to be correlated with hotter temperatures. In the 17th century, the solar cycle appears to have stopped entirely for several decades; very few sunspots were observed during this period. During this era, which is known as the or , Europe experienced very cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of and also appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures. space weather since luminosity has a direct relationship with magnetic activity Maunder minimum Little Ice Age [58] tree rings

Theoretical problems
Solar neutrino problem
For many years the number of solar detected on Earth was one third to one half of the number predicted by the . This anomalous result was termed the . Theories proposed to resolve the problem either tried to reduce the temperature of the Sun's interior to explain the lower neutrino flux, or posited that electron neutrinos could that is, change into undetectable and as they traveled between the Sun and the Earth. Several neutrino observatories were built in the 1980s to measure the solar neutrino flux as accurately as possible, including the and . Results from these observatories eventually led to the discovery that neutrinos have a very small and do indeed oscillate. Moreover, in 2001 the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was able to detect all three types of neutrinos directly, and found that the Sun's neutrino emission rate agreed with the Standard Solar Model, although depending on the neutrino energy as few as one-third of the neutrinos seen at Earth are of the electron type. This proportion agrees with that predicted by the (also known as the matter effect), which describes neutrino oscillation in matter. Hence, the problem is now resolved. electron neutrinos standard solar model solar neutrino problem oscillate tau muon neutrinos [61] Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Kamiokande rest mass [62] total Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect [] citation needed
Coronal heating problem
Main article: Corona
The optical surface of the Sun (the ) is known to have a temperature of approximately 6,000 . Above it lies the solar corona at a temperature of 1,000,000 K. The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat from the photosphere. photosphere K conduction
It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is heating, in which sound, gravitational and magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat. The other is heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through in the form of large and myriad similar but smaller events. wave magnetic magnetic reconnection solar flares [63]
Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfv n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms. One possible candidate to explain coronal heating is continuous flaring at small scales, but this remains an open topic of investigation. Alfv n waves [64] [65]
Faint young Sun problem
Main article: Faint young Sun paradox
Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the , the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on the Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that the Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and in fact that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among scientists is that the young Earth's atmosphere contained much larger quantities of (such as , and/or ) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the lesser amount of reaching the planet.
