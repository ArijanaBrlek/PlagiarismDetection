This challenge to extract valuable knowledge
massive
data sets is made even more difficult by the different types of data sources and many different scales - not to mention the ultimate goal in near-real time. To analyze the problem, the science and technology of the driver can be grouped into three main categories: managing the explosion of knowledge retrieval of data from large sets of data by reducing the data to facilitate human understanding and response.
The answer: an approach to intensive computer data PNNL DIC: combine R &amp; D in the hybrid hardware architectures, software, adaptable architectures, and advanced analysis algorithms to provide to the end users actual capabilities that make it impossible to solve the problems.
