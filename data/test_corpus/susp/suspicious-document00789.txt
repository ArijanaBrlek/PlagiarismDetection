An A-7B Corsair II aircraft from Naval Air Reserve Attack Squadron 305 (VA-305)
In 1962, the began preliminary work on (Heavier-than-air, Attack, Experimental), a replacement for the with greater range and payload. A particular emphasis was placed on accurate delivery of weapons to reduce the cost per target. The requirements were finalized in 1963 and in 1964, the Navy announced the (Heavier-than-air, Attack, Light) competition. Contrary to USAF philosophy, which was to employ only supersonic fighter bombers such as the and , the Navy felt that a subsonic design could carry the most payload the farthest distance. Theoretically, a "slow fat duck" could fly nearly as fast as a supersonic one, since carrying dozens of iron bombs also restricted its entry speed, but a fast aircraft with small wings and an afterburner would burn more fuel.

To minimize costs, all proposals had to be based on existing designs. , , and responded. The Vought proposal was based on the successful fighter, having a similar configuration, but shorter and more stubby, with a rounded nose. It was selected as the winner on , and on the company received a contract for the initial batch of aircraft, designated . In 1965, the aircraft received the popular name , after Vought's highly successful of . (There was also a Vought biplane scout and observation aircraft in 1920s.)

Compared to the F-8 fighter, the A-7 had a shorter, broader fuselage. The wing was made larger, and the unique variable incidence wing of the F-8 was deleted. To achieve the required range, the A-7 was powered by a -P-6 producing 11,345 lbf (50.5 kN) of thrust, the same innovative combat turbofan produced for the and early , but without the afterburner needed for supersonic speeds. Turbofans achieve greater efficiency by moving a larger mass of air at a lower velocity. Pratt & Whitney TF30 turbofan F-111 F-14 Tomcats
The aircraft was fitted with an radar, later followed by the , which was integrated into the ILAAS digital navigation system. The radar also fed a digital weapons computer which made possible accurate delivery of bombs from a greater stand-off distance, greatly improving survivability compared with faster platforms such as the . It was the first U.S. aircraft to have a modern head-up display, now a standard instrument, which displayed information such as dive angle, airspeed, altitude, drift and aiming reticle. The integrated navigation system allowed for another innovation the projected map display system (PMDS) which accurately showed aircraft position on two different map scales.

The A-7 enjoyed the fastest and most trouble free development period of any American combat aircraft since . The made its first flight on , and began to enter Navy squadron service late in 1966. The first Navy A-7 squadrons reached operation status on , and began combat operations over in December of that year. World War II YA-7A 27 September 1965 1 February 1967 Vietnam

Secretary of Defence prodded the Air Force to adopt not only the hugely successful F-4, but also the Navy's A-7 Corsair as a low-cost follow-on to F-105s until the troubled F-111 came online, and as a close-air support replacement for . On , the USAF announced that it would purchase a version of the A-7, designated the , for . The Air Force ordered the A-7D with a fixed high speed refueling receptacle behind the pilot optimized for the 's flying boom rather than the folding long of the Navy aircraft. The most important difference from the preceding Navy versions was the adoption of the turbofan, a license-built version of British Rolls-Royce Spey. With 14,500 lbf (64.5 kN) of thrust, the engine offered a considerable boost in performance. The cannon was selected in place of the twin single-barrel 20 mm cannon. In addition, avionics were upgraded. The prototype with TF30 flew on , with the first TF41 aircraft taking to the air on . The aircraft were later updated to carry the laser spot tracker to add the capability to drop guided bombs. A total of 459 were built and assigned to tactical fighter wings of the (TAC).

The Navy was so impressed with the performance gain of USAF A-7D that they ordered their own version with the TF41 engine and M61 cannon, the , to go along with the new continuous solution weapon systems and sophisticated avionics that was developed in the A-7C model that was highly advanced for that era. The first prototype flew on . A-7Es were turned out in 1970s with outstanding mission success in the fleet. In 1979 the first around-the-clock night-attack FLIR-capable aircraft were delivered to VA-81 at , Florida. During the 1980s, when defense budgets finally allowed, funding for upgrades various system upgrades and engineering change proposal mods were incorporated to increase reliability, safety and mission effectiveness. In 1986, 231 A-7Es were equipped to carry the (Low-Altitude Night Attack) pod which projected amplified light image on the HUD and, in conjunction with radar, provided terrain following down to 460 mph (740 km/h) at 200 ft (60 m). A total of 529 examples were built (not counting 67 A-7Cs).A-7E 25 November 1968 NAS Cecil Field LANA
YA-7F "Strikefighter" prototype in 1989
In 1985, the USAF requested proposals for a fast strike aircraft because of concerns that was too slow for interdiction. The design called for a new engine, either the -PW-220 or -GE 100. LTV responded with the YA-7F, a supersonic version of A-7 powered by an F100-PW-220 with 26,000 lbf (116 kN) thrust. To accommodate the new engine, the fuselage was lengthened about 4 ft (1.22 m). New fuselage sections were inserted in both the forward and aft fuselage - a 30 in (76 cm) section in front of the wing and an 18 in (46 cm) section behind the wing. The wing was strengthened and fitted with new augmented flaps, leading edge extensions and automatic maneuvering flaps. The vertical stabilizer height was increased about 10 in (25 cm)the unit horizontal tail was flipped from dihedral to anhedral, and control surfaces were flattened. Unsurprisingly, the end result resembled the supersonic F-8 Crusader from which the original subsonic A-7 was derived. A-10 Thunderbolt II Pratt & Whitney F100 General Electric F110
The new supersonic A-7 could accelerate with a 17,380 lb (7,880 kg) bomb load from 400 to 550 knots (1,020 km/h) in under 15 seconds and could sustain Mach 1.6 for longer times with the extra fuel. The YA-7F modifications allowed 7-g turn and burn capability that permitted high-speed sustained evasive maneuvers plus great improvements in high angle of attack performance. As a CAS/BAI platform to penetrate into enemy territory and return safely, the "Strikefighter" moniker was most fitting. Two A-7Ds were extensively modified, the first one flying on and breaking the on its second flight. The second prototype flew on . The project was canceled due to improved relations with former adversaries, lower defense budgets, and the , by then the principal USAF operator of the A-7 generally favoring the in-production . 29 November 1989 sound barrier 3 April 1990 Air National Guard F-16 Fighting Falcon [] citation needed

Production of Corsairs continued through 1984, yielding a total of 1,569 aircraft built. The A-7 Corsair has the distinction of being the only United States single seat jet fighter-bomber of the 1960s that was designed, built, and deployed directly into the Vietnam War.
[] edit Operational history
Initial operational basing/homeporting for A-7 squadrons was at , Florida for Atlantic Fleet units and , California for Pacific Fleet units. This was in keeping with the role of these bases in already hosting the attack squadrons that would eventually transition to the A-7. From 1967 - 1971 a total of 27 Navy squadrons took delivery of four different A-7A/B/C/E models. The Vought plant in Dallas, TX employed up to 35,000 workers turned out one aircraft a day for several years to support the Navy carrier-based needs for Vietnam and SE Asia and commitments to NATO in Europe. In 1974, when the (CV 41) became the first Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) aircraft carrier to be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, two A-7A squadrons assigned to Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5) were concurrently homeported at , Japan. In 1978, these squadrons (VA-93 and VA-56) finally transitioned to the much more advanced A-7E model. Six Naval Reserve squadrons would also eventually transition to the A-7, operating from , Florida; NAS Atlanta/, Georgia; , Louisiana; , California and , California. An additional active duty squadron stood up in the 1980s, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at would also operate twin-seat TA-7C and EA-7L aircraft with both a pilot and a in an adversary electroic warfare role.

Initial USAF basing of the A-7D was at , and , in 1968 for prototype testing. Initial lead-in pilot training squadrons were established at , , and , in 1969. The first operational USAF basing was at , (354 TFW) in 1970, with subsequent basing at , (355 TFW) in 1971 and , (23 TFW) in 1972. The Luke-based A-7Ds were reassigned to Davis-Monthan in 1971 along with the lead-in pilot training mission. A fourth operational A-7D wing was assigned to , (388 TFW) in early 1973 derived from deployed Myrtle Beach aircraft.

Pilots of the early A-7s lauded the aircraft for general ease of flying (with the exceptions of poor stability on cross-wind landings and miserable stopping performance on wet runways with an inoperative anti-skid braking system) and excellent forward visibility but noted a lack of engine thrust. This was addressed with A-7B and more thoroughly with A-7D/E. The turbofan engine provided a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency compared with earlier the A-7D was said to have one sixth that of an at equivalent thrust. An A-7D carrying 12 x 500 lb (227 kg) bombs at 480 mph (775 km/h) at 33,000 ft (10,000 m) used only 3,350 lb (1,500 kg) of fuel per hour. Typical fuel consumption at mission retrograde during aircraft carrier recovery was approximately 30 pounds per minute compared to 100+ pounds per minute for the Phantom F-4J/N series. The A-7 Corsair II was tagged with the nickname "SLUF" ("hort ittle gly ucker") by pilots. turbojets specific fuel consumption F-100 Super Sabre [1] SLUF
The integrated weapons computer provided highly accurate bombing with of 60 ft (20 m) regardless of pilot experience. When Vought technical representatives were available to "tweak" the inertial systems, the CEP was often less than five meters for experienced fleet aviators. The inertial navigation system required a mere 2.5 minutes on the ground for partial (coarse) alignment, a big improvement over 13 minutes required in . For newly manufactured E models, the A-7 required only 11.5 of maintenance per mission resulting in quick turnaround and high number of combat-ready aircraft. However, after several years of exposure to the harsh marine conditions aboard aircraft carriers, the maintenance hours per sortie were often twice this amount. CEP F-4 Phantom II man hours
For its day, the SLUF offered a plethora of leading edge avionics. This included data link capabilities that, among other features, provided fully "hands-off" carrier landing capability when used in conjunction with its approach power compensator (APC) or auto throttle. Other notable and highly advanced equipment was a projected map display located just below the radar scope. The map display was slaved to the inertial navigation system and provided a high-resolution map image of the aircraft's position superimposed over TPC/JNC charts. Moreover, when slaved to the all-axis auto pilot, the inertial navigation system could fly the aircraft "hands off" to up to nine individual way points. Typical inertial drift was minimal for newly manufactured models and the inertial measurement system accepted fly over, radar, and TACAN updates. [2]
Pilots quipped that the Corsair "is not very fast, but it sure is slow." For (DACT), and aerial demonstrations by the , the Navy would choose the more nimble as a subsonic maneuvering platform, as some considered the A-7 to be inadequate in air combat, even though it was highly maneuverable and was more fitting as a highly successful attack aircraft with a stable bombing platform. The Marine Corps would also pass on the Corsair, opting instead for the vertical landing as their light attack aircraft to replace their A-4F/M Skyhawks. and units, however, were often forced to operate the A-7E and D models in rather challenging air-to-air duels with USAF and USN . Several SLUF units adopted a technique pioneered by the : if an F-15 Eagle approaches gun range, depart the A-7 from controlled flight and deploy as much chaff and flares as possible. Departing an A-7 from controlled flight resulted in very high and simultaneous roll, yaw and pitch rates. It also caused a near instantaneous airspeed loss of 100 to 150 knots (280 km/h) that made successful gun-tracking by an opponent nearly impossible. Deploying chaff and flares during such an event spewed these devices in all directions as the range between the two aircraft rapidly diminished and consequently posed a chaff/flare collision threat to the attacking aircraft documented by Puerto Rican and units.

USS Ranger
In Vietnam, the hot, humid air robbed even the upgraded A-7D and A-7E of power. Takeoff rolls were lengthy and fully-armed aircraft struggled to reach 800 km/h. For A-7A aircraft, high density altitude and maximum weight runway takeoffs often necessitated a "low transition," where the aircraft was intentionally held in "ground effect" a few feet off the runway during gear retraction, and as much as a 10-mile (16 km) departure at treetop altitude before reaching a safe flap retraction speed.(Note: the A-7A wing flap systems were either fully extended or fully retracted. The A-7A flap handle did not have the microswitch feature of later models that permitted the flaps to be slowly raised by several degrees per tap of the flap handle as airspeed slowly increased during max-weight takeoffs.) [4] [5]
Carrier catapult launches at maximum weight under these performance-robbing conditions were not significantly better and were characterized by the aircraft decelerating by as much as 20 knots (37 km/h) immediately after launch. As a result, A-7A units operated their aircraft 4 thousand pounds below the max-rated takeoff weight for the A-7E. [6] [7]
The first U.S. Navy A-7As were deployed to Vietnam in 1967 with aboard . The aircraft made their first combat sortie on . In the following months, VA-147 flew around 1,400 sorties losing only one aircraft. In January 1968, USS participated in the incident surrounding the capture of in the by . The Navy's improved A-7B model arrived in Vietnam in early 1969, with the definitive A-7E following in 1971. The U.S. Navy's first A-7 loss occurred on , less than three weeks after entering combat.

The USAF A-7Ds were also widely used in Vietnam and with , and the , flying from , Thailand. A-7s from the 354th TFW entered action in October 1972 and attacked targets as far as 800 km from airbases, extensively utilizing mid-air refueling. The A-7Ds were quickly assigned the "Sandy mission" of providing air cover for missions of downed pilots. Taking over for (and adopting their call sign of "Sandy"), the A-7's higher speed was somewhat detrimental for escorting the helicopters but the aircraft's high endurance and durability were an asset and it performed admirably. On , Major Colin A. Clarke led a successful CSAR mission near to rescue a downed crew. The mission lasted a total of 8.8 hours during which Clarke and his wingman took a number of hits from 0.51 cal (12.7 mm) anti-aircraft fire. For his actions in coordinating the rescue, Clarke was awarded the , the USAF's second-highest decoration for valor, and his A-7D (AF Serial No. 70-0970) was eventually placed on display on at the at , Ohio.

During the war in Southeast Asia, U.S. Navy A-7 Corsairs were painted gloss gray/white in color while USAF A-7s were normally painted in full jungle camouflage paint schemes. The U.S. Navy did experiment with paint schemes for some of their aircraft during the war, but during landing operations, the flight deck crews found their duties complicated, due to the inherent changing of the weather conditions aboard a moving ship and the color coded uniforms of the flight deck crew; with the added dangers involved to an already cluttered flight deck, it was determined to keep naval aircraft readily visible for the sake of safety. camouflage
On , A-7E aircraft aboard the USS Coral Sea, in conjunction with A-7D aircraft assigned to the 388 TFW / 3 TFS at Korat RTAFB, provided air cover in what is considered the last battle of the Vietnam war, the recovery of the after it was hijacked by Cambodian communists. By the time Operation Mayaguez was over, three U.S. helicopters had been shot down, six received severe damage, three others were heavily damaged and only one was still flyable. Of the total force of 231 Marines, Airmen, and Sailors who landed on Koh Tang Island during this operation, 18 men were KIA or unaccounted for and at least three of these were later determined to have been inadvertently left alive on the island. 15 May 1975 SS Mayag ez
