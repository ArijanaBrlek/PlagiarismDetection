the resources
to conflict that the conflict has not yet happened. However, this is not
the only reason that the conflict has not occurred. Governments,

Egypt and the Egyptian Nile claimed it was using water management and agriculture about
5,000 years in the Nile valley. The Egyptians practiced Basin, a form of water
management adapted to the natural growth and the fall of the Nile River. Since around 3000 BC, the Egyptians
built banks of earth to form alluvial basins of various sizes that
have been adjusted from closed
to redirect the flood in the basin, where it sat until the soil was
saturated, the water is was then emptied, and
crops planted. : An important
approach to collaboration is ground there is the principle of
subsidiarity
in the framework of the
entire basin. Easily to each development of real work to work
Cooperative 4 make the decisions at the level of the minimum
required. Strategic action
plan and a strategic action plan are
two complementary sub-programs included. To promote shared this vision and work on the
ground through the realization of the vision-
Please refer to figure 1. Development of a common vision and commitment and a
clear goal to build basin may need to
filter in promoting them at a
level as a whole, to Central and local government levels.
However, shared vision alone is not available,
powered by the action on the ground,
and must be nourished certainly- Provides step-by-step
instructions on how to build
trust between the banks of the country and meet the needs of the people.
The program is linked with
the practical training program (ATP) in the framework of the Nile
Basin Initiative (NBI) joint program of
vision (SVP). NBRP consists of, and will
support the sustainability of the activities and
initiatives, and will take the form of individual research and joint development and joint research projects,
and the
establishment of research groups of the Nile Basin, and
dissemination Research results through
knowledge, seminars and workshops, and publications. It is a
priority to strengthen existing networks, as well as a new start. It should also develop joint educational programs that reflect the needs and priorities

not pay for water, but for irrigation and

effort to produce clean water will
take time, measures that
may be adopted as short-term results are: Tapping in shallow wells for

The shape and composition of the Nile and the Nile Delta is considered "curved" delta (arching), and is similar to a flower or a triangle, viewed from the top.
Climate Lotus Nile Delta has a Mediterranean, through little.
Only 100 to 200 mm of rain falls during an
average year in the Delta
region, and most falls in the winter months. The Delta experienced its highest temperatures in July and August with an average 30  C, with a maximum of around 48 C. Winter temperatures are typically in the range of 5 to 10 C. The Nile Delta region is humid during the summer months. The Nile Delta is at a rate of 50 km per year, and it is expected that this Delta rain disappeared his eroding climate year 2550AD [] Edit main programs NBI consists of three main programs: the Shared Vision Program, the Nile Subsidiary Action Program East and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Action Programme Subsidiary.

official presentation of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) officially to the public. Said, in his speech, representatives of civil society and
non-governmental organizations work in it support to the Nile
Basin Initiative (NBI) vision,
and made it very clear that all people are active should
have its own voice, heard. Here, June 2001 Sustainable development and management of the Nile Basin is a major challenge and there remain many opportunities for growth and development for the
future, so. The promise of regional harmony and economic development At the
heart of this challenge is the imperative to eradicate poverty. Without action now, the littoral states are faced with many problems such as
hunger, poverty, environmental degradation
and rapid population growth. This is a clear
challenge for the peoples
of the basin and calls vision and
leadership. The purpose of this brief document is to provide
guidelines for a strategic plan that are required in
order to realize the potential of the Nile for the benefit of
all. The time has come to move from planning to action. Second Objectives The objectives are: Year, established on 1998. It is composed of senior public employees and provides
