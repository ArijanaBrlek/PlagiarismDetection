[] edit Overview
All can be considered part of brain mapping. Brain mapping can be conceived as a higher form of , producing brain images supplemented by the result of additional (imaging or non-imaging) data processing or analysis, such as maps projecting (measures of) behaviour onto brain regions (see ). neuroimaging neuroimaging fMRI
Brain Mapping techniques are constantly evolving, and rely on the development and refinement of image acquisition, representation, analysis, and interpretation techniques. Functional and structural are at the core of the aspect of Brain Mapping. visualization neuroimaging mapping
[] edit History
In the late 1980s in the United States, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science was commissioned to establish a panel to investigate the value of integrating neuroscientific information across a variety of techniques. [1]
Of specific interest is using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (), electroencephalography (), (PET) and other non-invasive scanning techniques to map , , , function and of the human brain. Both healthy and brains may be mapped to study , , , and effects in various populations such as people with , , and . This led to the establishment of the Human Brain Project. fMRI EEG positron emission tomography anatomy physiology perfusion phenotypes diseased memory learning aging drug schizophrenia autism clinical depression [2]
Following a series of meetings, the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) evolved. The ultimate goal is to develop flexible . [3] computational brain atlases
