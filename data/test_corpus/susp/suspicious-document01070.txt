Volvo Group, as one of the largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles in the world, took the initiative to sell its automobile manufacturing in 1998 in order to fully focus its efforts on the market for commercial vehicles.

[] edit Corporate history within Ford
Volvo Car Corporation is part of Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group (). It is the only brand left in the group since the sale of , and . Since its acquisition into the PAG, the company has grown in its range of vehicles. After the sale of JLR to Tata of India, Ford decided to keep Volvo Cars despite mounting losses and gross economic down turns. Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars, pushing it further upmarket alongside the lower end of Mercedes and BMW sedans, wagons, and SUV crossovers. This turnaround was quite evident with the luxurious second generation Volvo S80 and the new small premium crossover Volvo XC60. Recently, there were talks about what to do with Volvo Cars in the event of a market failure with US automakers that would include parent FOMOCO. Swedish interest mounted their concerns after repeated mass layoffs at Volvo, expressing that Sweden needs to enter the spotlight to help its automotive industry. The government was asked to look into a possible state ownership of Volvo, or financing Volvo Cars and SAAB of GM. Eventually AB Volvo responded to heated talks and decided that they do not want to see Volvo Cars fail, so they agreed to help Volvo cut costs through parternships and even a possible share ownership amongst a larger consortium. AB Volvo repeated and stood stern that they will not buy back Volvo cars nor be sole majority owner. They are only willing to become part share owner of the once car unit. FOMOCO announced in December 2008 that it is now considering a sale of the Volvo Cars unit through complex evaluations, but meanwhile it will try to make Volvo a more stand alone company. The Swedish government is now willing to help with a possible Swedish aquisiton of Volvo Cars in the near future along with AB Volvo. No suitors have shown interest in a possible purchase as yet but it is believed that BMW AG of Germany, Investor AB of Sweden, Chinese investors, or Russian investors are all possible candidates. Ultimately it will not be a price issue for the new owner but rather whom Volvo Cars prefer to take over, AB Volvo decides to release name trademark too, and Ford feels will have FOMOCO and Volvo's best interest.

VCNA management is often criticized for canceling the Free Maintenance program it used to offer on it's new Automobiles back in 2006, Volvo relaunched the same program in 2009 to gain some market share and compete with BMW.
