The Millbrook High School Band is one of the finest in the area, also conducted by Mr. Craig Fryer. The Millbrook Jazz Band performs at many concerts and competitions throughout the year, both for the school and the community. Although most of the players in the Jazz Band are drawn from the Concert Band, some students are encouraged to join the group by Craig Fryer. Jazz The Millbrook High School Mixed is directed by Ms. Alexis Clements. Considerably larger than
the Concert Band,
the Mixed Chorus performs in many of the same concerts in which the Concert Band plays. Happy New Year Everyone!! In just nine short months, East Ridge High School will open its doors to students.

This is the first time East Ridge has gone to State Competition for Concert Band. The band was directed by Jack Hart and was composed of 51 students. Best way to get a man to do something: suggest he's too old for it. It was the final examination for an introductory English course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out new students, having over 700 students in the class! The examination
was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that
any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the
student would fail. The school was built to stop the overcrowding of their mother, now sister school, , which is located in Groveland. 2002 Lake County, Florida South Lake High School [] edit Students Student enrolment at East Ridge High School is currently 3,084 as of January 14th, East Ridge has a very diverse population.

0 comments Tuesday, November 25, 2008 Happy Thanksgiving I think I can speak for the entire East Ridge planning team and wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. We are thankful for our new East Ridge Community, and look forward to working with you. Enjoy your day!! "You're not going to have
time to finish this," the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet. "Yes I will," replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in. 1/2 hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there. "No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late." The student looked incredulous and angry. "Do you know WHO I am?" "No, as a matter of fact I don't," replied the professor with an
air of disdain.. Some guidelines for your submission: 1) All lyrics must be submitted with words legibly written underneath the printed music of the song (this guarantees that your lyrics match the existing melody). A copy of the song without lyrics is provided on the next page. 2) Specific values, discussed by students, incorporate what the community of East Ridge stands for. These values are: pride, aggressiveness, leadership, respect, brotherhood/sisterhood, strength, enthusiasm, determination, tradition, unity, trust, domination, power, fearlessness, focus, intimidation, intelligence, and awareness. The lyrics should reflect these values. 3) Your lyrics should fit the existing music without rhythmic adaptation.
