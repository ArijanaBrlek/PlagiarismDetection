In 2000, the European PVC
industry has launched a ten-year plan to improve the sustainability of its products and production during the entire life cycle. This means constantly improving products and production processes, by investing in technology to reduce emissions and waste, and to increase the collection and recycling. The program is based on the "voluntary" signed by Vinyl 2010. After the publication, the commitment received a series of comments consultations public and political, including the Directorate General environment of
the European Commission
Enterprise Directorate-General. This led, in 2001, a document, revised and expanded. four member associations, key commitments include:
compliance with the standard PVC ECVM Charter of production. A plan for the complete replacement of the stabilizers to the lead by
2015, in addition to the replacement of cadmium stabilizers was achieved in March 2001. The recycling at the end of the year 2010 of 200,000 tons /
year of PVC post-consumer waste 50% of the waste collection of PVC available for Windows, pipes, fittings and roofing in 2005 profiles, and a ground in 2008. Little expansion or contraction of the element resistance of glass fibers (see above) a maximum level of protection. Dimensional stability: meetings of today new codes of practice for energy

The Food and Drug Administration, found that most patients have minimal risk of exposure to DEHP and added that "the risk of not doing a
procedure
required is much higher than the risks associated with DEHP exposure." The European Commission's Scientific Committee for medicinal products and medical devices, said that there have been reports of adverse reactions in humans after exposure to DEHP-PVC and concluded that currently there are no specific recommendations can be made for restricting the use of DEHP in a specific group of patients. (October 2002) plasticizers are used in products such as
pipes, rigid vinyl cladding and rigid packaging. How secure is the
abolition of the vinyl? Vinyl products yes most lasts a long time, but when they reach the end of their useful life, can be administered like other consumer products, for disposal or recycling. For long products (conservation) in which wires, walls, Windows, floors and others may not be available for recovery or disposal. But recycling millions of
pounds of waste material vinyl each year, according to a report by the Vinyl Institute. In addition, some companies are environmentally PVC guard. Playpark structure and GameTime brand Playcore, both

"The National Recreation and Park Association is composed of 22,000 professional park planners and U.S. citizens" to "advance parks, recreation and conservation efforts that enhance the environmental quality of life for all peoples. Vinyl Institute represents the leading

exhibition, as well as other health and environmental concerns of PVC, it is important to investigate
alternative materials for medical purposes. "In fact, a growing number of hospitals and medical equipment suppliers is gradually PVC products and replacing them with safer alternatives. Recent examples include Baxter International, Inc., The nation's leading manufacturer of IV bags, Universal Health Services, Inc.., Management company the third largest hospital in the country, and Kaiser Permanente, the largest non-profit health maintenance organization in
America. In addition to revealing the sensitivity of patient exposure to DEHP, the coalition noted that the vinyl IV bags have a high
content of chlorine. Therefore, the
manufacture of vinyl

Michael Schade, PVC campaign coordinator with the Center for Health, Environment and Justice." Plastic packaging contain heavy metals
that can be harmful to our health and the environment. Safer PVC-free packaging are available on a large scale, and companies Innovative eliminate

a long option, low maintenance, but one should be aware of the "dark side" of PVC. The second part of the third part
of the first part of the production of PVC is actually quite harmful to the environment and our health. Dioxins, highly toxic chemicals created during the process Its production, was also released into the
atmosphere on burning. Dioxins break down slowly in the environment, as either carcinogens reasonable person. Harmful additives are also used vinyl, such as heavy metals, which act as stabilizers or give it color; fungicides. Less than 1% of PVC is recycled because it is not technically
feasible or economically. A
national coalition of more than 60 environmental and health organizations call on the goal to phase out PVC in products and packaging.
Since October, more than 40,000 customers Target signed petitions and sent letters to the company and more than 200 events were held at the destination stores throughout the country. Nineteen countries have

Among the most important by-products of the life cycle of PVC are dioxin, EDC (ethylene dichloride) and VCM (vinyl chloride monomer). The formation of dioxin a rotting organic compounds is one of the most potent carcinogens known to science (there's no safe
dose) and one in which it is exposed every American is a direct consequence of the chlorine content of s vinyl. Depending on your goals for the

like other organic products. The most important toxic substance is released during fire carbon monoxide (CO), which
is responsible for 90 to 95% of fire deaths. CO is a cunning murderer, because we can not smell it and most people die in
fires while sleeping.
