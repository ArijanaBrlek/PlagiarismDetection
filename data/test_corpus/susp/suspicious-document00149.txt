Kids deserve their very own circle of care.
There are much bigger differences between kids and adults than size alone. That's why everything at Wolfson Children's Hospital is designed with children and families in mind. Giant crayons mark our entrance, and red wagons transport our little patients through the halls. And within this unique, child-friendly environment, an amazing team of pediatric specialists mends bodies, lifts spirits and embraces the entire family into the care-giving experience.      More...
