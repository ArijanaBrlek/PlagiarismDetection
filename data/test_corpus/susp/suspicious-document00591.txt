Director's Message
Michael Kluse, Laboratory Director
Welcome to the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a world-class center of scientific and engineering expertise. PNNL is one of five DOE Office of Science multi-program laboratories and is dedicated to delivering results and advancing science and technology in energy, environment, and national security.
We also are firmly focused on the future and meeting emerging national and international needs. Along with implementing a bold vision for science and leadership at PNNL, we are progressing on our ambitious Capability Replacement Laboratory project, which will deliver new and updated research facilities by 2011. As our business grows, we continue to streamline our organizational structure, enhance operations, and make improvements that will speed delivery of quality research.
Our staff members are central to our success. Dedicated, award-winning researchers come together across a spectrum of disciplines to consistently deliver results for our clients' most pressing issues.
While our work is important to the nation and world, we also consider ourselves an important partner at the local and regional level. For more than four decades, we have been teaming with the community and state to strengthen the economy and educate the next generation of scientists and engineers.
PNNL is a great national resource. I hope you'll explore our Web site and see what we can do for you.
