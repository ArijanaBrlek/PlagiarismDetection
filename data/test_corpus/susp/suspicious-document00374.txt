Common symptoms of arrhythmia include: symptom (a impression of skipped or fluttering heartbeats) irregular or rapid pulse or pulse, light-headedness, or fainting sweating of breath Symptoms of Symptoms can range from intense to severe, depending on flutter and your health.  For example, taking coronary drugs used from treat heart disorders (such beta-footballer, calcium, and digoxin) can cause sick cardiopathy. Causes Arrhythmias are most particularly caused by other heart, commonly sure disease, heart, and heart. Many drugs, prescription, can cause or worsen arrhythmias. Arrhythmias result of problems initiating and conducting electrical currents include failure of the heart's pacemaker (some cases to sinus arrhythmia and slow syndrome) and heart.
