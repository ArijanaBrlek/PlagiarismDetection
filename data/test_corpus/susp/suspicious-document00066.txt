VCM Transportation presents the same risks as other transport flammable gases such as propane, butane (LPG) or natural gas (for applying the same safety standards). No fatal accident occurred in Europe in the last 40 years with the transport of VCM. The most serious accident during that time was in 1996 in the former East Germany. The reason for this was the condition of the railroad track, not the product or carrying railroad cars. Safety is always a concern and here we have a clear winner.
Aluminum is extremely strong and is the material of choice where security is of great concern. This explains why aluminum is commonly seen in commercial establishments. Wood and PVC-u have their
weaknesses. PVC-u expands during warm conditions and the necessary
expansion gaps can become weak points for intruders. Currently, Shin-Etsu Group is the
largest producer of PVC, with a
capacity of large-scale production in the three major

The article says there were 134 baby boys in the study, when in fact only 85 of the mothers were donated urine.
