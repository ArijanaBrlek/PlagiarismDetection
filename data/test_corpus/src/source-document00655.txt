Student playing a Yamaha trombone rental from Gills Music
The slide trombone has been around pretty much in its present form since way back in the 1400's. Unlike most other musical instruments it was built "correctly" in the beginning and so it has never had to be redesigned! This is a powerful low brass instrument that takes lots of air and long arms to play. If you have the size and air required to play the trombone you could be a hero in your school band because every band sounds much better with a good trombone section. The trombone plays both classical and jazz music equally well and sounds awesome in both styles.Trombone
