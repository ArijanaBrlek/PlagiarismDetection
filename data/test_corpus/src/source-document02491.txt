A Generous Donation Indeed!
 
Recently, the Brandy Station Foundation was the recipient of a wonderful historical gift! Through the auspices of Stevensburg District County Supervisor Bill Chase, Mr. Wayne Mills donated his collection of the The collection, encompassing 127 of the 128 original volumes and some 18-24 cubic feet of knowledge, will now provide a firm basis for historical civil war research at the Graffiti House. As a bonus, this set of OR volumes was originally printed in 1891 and originally given to then Congressman F. L. Coombs of California, whose name is embellished in gold leaf on the spine of the books. With this marking, the OR is quite a historical artifact by itself. Thank you Wayne and Bill!Official Records (OR) of the War of the Rebellion.
Will You Help?
 
During the winter of 2005-6, your Brandy station Foundation (BSF) was able to do two things it had never done before.  First it was able to save, virtually single handed, a prime piece of Brandy Station battlefield land - the former Golden Oaks property at the foot of Fleetwood Hill.  Second, within just a couple of months, the BSF was able to purchase another prime piece of battlefield property - but this time at Kelly's Ford.  These purchases were made in your name and were generously supported by you.
 
However, I am disappointed to say, we are still about of having enough money to pay the mortgage on the properties.  The money, although significant, is not great - but in concert with other outstanding mortgages/operational costs from the Graffiti House, the debt creates a situation where the BSF has a very limited flexibility for the future.$25,000 short
 
When we look around Culpeper today, we see a county in the midst of a great transition.  What the future will bring we do not know - but what we can anticipate is that the future will be significantly different than what we have experienced previously.  The best way to combat the uncertainties of this future is to provide ourselves with the maximum amount of flexibility for our affairs. This flexibility can be provided by successfully ending our most outstanding debts - such as the $25,000.
 
As you can see by this and our past newsletters, this organization is doing significant work to preserve America's heritage in Culpeper County.  We can best continue these works by taking action to put ourselves in the driver's seat for our future.  Minimizing our debt is one such effort we can do to help ourselves - but we need your support. Will you help?
  Teachers Visit Culpeper/Graffiti House
 
On July 21st twenty teachers from Fauquier Public Schools visited the Graffiti House as part of the county's in-service program. After a morning with Virginia Morton at Cedar Mountain battlefield, the teachers assembled after lunch at Brandy Station. Veteran guide Jim Flanagan provided a historic tour de force demonstrating the geographic importance of the Rappahannock River on the shape of the Civil War. Many of the teachers had no knowledge of the battles fought at Kelly's Ford, Beverly Ford and Brandy Station. Linking these events to the messages left on the walls of the Graffiti House gave a thrill to the teachers and an appreciation for the history that is on our doorstep. Fauquier High teacher Dawn Brown said, had no idea how important this area is!
 
With popular emphasis onSOLtest results, time constraints forced by block scheduling and the increased price of fuel, field trips have been discouraged by many schools. With the knowledge that they do not have to drive to Washington DC or Williamsburg for a valuable out-of-class experience, many of the teachers are already planning to incorporate the Graffiti House in the curriculum. Additionally many high school social studies teachers require community service hours as part of the grade for graduating seniors. The Graffiti House provides a wealth of opportunities for contributing to the public in our area.
  Annual Meeting 2007
 
The annual Meeting for the Brandy Station Foundation will be held March 2nd, 2007 at the Brandy Station Fire Hall.  The event will last from 6:30 to 9:00; our speaker will be Joe McKinney and the food will be great and there will be lots of it!!  Don't miss it!
 
Interests have been as keen as the weather has been hot for the BSF Sunday Seminar series!
 
The series began on June 25th with a thought provoking presentation by Dr. Dan Beattie on the Dahlgren-Kilpatrick Raid on Richmond in 1864.  Dan brought to life the personalities of the main participants as well as the operational difficulties that both armies faced in trying to achieve and/or defend the raid!  As to the main question-who knew what and when --you would have had to be at the Graffiti House to get the answer.
 
On July 30th, Brigadier General John DePue (Retired) shared the trials and tribulations of the men who fought as the 1st New Jersey Cavalry. Beginning at their enlistment, General DePue discussed the men, their leaders and the leaders shortcomings as they advanced through the war to the June 9th,1863, Battle of Brandy Station. The old saying e have met the enemy and they are us- takes on special meaning when placed in the context of this very interesting - but flawed, regiment.
 
On August 27th, Ms. Faren Wolter of the Piedmont Environmental Council, ably seconded by Culpeper legal eagle "Butch" Davies led a fascinating discussion concerning strategies available to protect Culpeper's History through Virginia Land Preservation Tax credits.  Speaking to a group of 25 interested parties, the discussion was spirited and interesting as well as hopefully useful to the participants.
 
On September 24th, Joe McKinney led a fascinating discussion of the Battle of Yellow Tavern and the Death of JEB Stuart.  Ably borrowing from his own independent research, Joe led the audience from the details of the fateful encounter to its placement within the larger scheme of late war Federal strategy.

Research Continues on Stuart Signature
 
As reported in the last newsletter, the name of JEB Stuart has been found on a wall of the Graffiti House. What remains to be done is to determine whether the name is just that - JEB Stuarts's name - or whether it is actually JEB Stuart's signature.  Some 10 examples of JEB Stuarts signature from the 1850 through his death in 1864 have been gathered for the purpose of comparing them against the wall signature.  Additionally, the wall name has been shown to several experts in the Confederate autograph field. Thus far,  the jury is still out and no firmconclusion has been reached.  If you have an interest in signatures, or an interest in JEB Stuart, or would just like to try your hand at CSI work, we would be interested in talking to you. Volunteers are needed!! For information contact us at(540) 727-7718 or email us at director@brandystationfoundation.com .
A Maryland Flask Visits
Recently Father William Aitcheson of Warrenton, Virginia, graciously allowed the Brandy Station Foundation to display for the summer a rare relic from his collection. The relic was a pewter drinking flask which at one time was owned by Henry (Hal) Hopkins of Breathed's Battery of the Stuart Horse Artillery.  It is the same Henry Hopkins whose name is the 4th listed name on the Maryland Scroll located in the rear upstairs room at the Graffiti House. While impossible to prove, it is possible that this very flask was in Henry's possession when the Maryland Scroll was drawn at the Graffiti House over 143 years ago. Thank you Father Aitcheson.
Robert E. Lee the 4th Visits Brandy Station
 
On July 9th the Brandy Station Foundation was honored to have as our guest at the Graffiti House in Brandy Station, Mr. Robert Edward LeeIV.
 
Bob Lee is the grandson of William Henry Fitzhugh (Rooney) Lee, and the great-grandson of General Robert E. Lee.  Mr. Lee came to Brandy Station to sign the Wall of Honor at the Graffiti House in the names of his illustrious ancestors.  Mr. Lee seemed as though the honor was his to add his name to the wall with the names of so many others who were on the field of battle.
 
Mr. Lee was most gracious in speaking to the crowd of about 75 who gathered on this hot afternoon to meet him, many asking for autographs and pictures and asking him to sign books about his ancestors.  One such request was from a young boy who came with his friends and his mother and presented his history book for Mr. Lee sign beside a picture of General R. E. Lee.
