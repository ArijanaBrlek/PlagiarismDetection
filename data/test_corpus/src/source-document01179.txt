A fascinating story of the first modern geologic map is told in , by Simon Winchester. It's the story of , a canal digger who created the first geologic map of Great Britain in 1819, but ended up in debtor's prison and lived homeless for 10 years until he was recognized for his work by King William IV in 1831.

In the , geologic maps are usually superimposed over a (and at times over other base maps) with the addition of a color mask with letter symbols to represent the kind of . The color mask denotes the exposure of the immediate , even if obscured by soil or other cover. Each area of color denotes a geologic unit or particular formation (as more information is gathered new geologic units may be defined). However, in areas where the bedrock is overlain by a significantly thick burden of , , deposits, or other important feature, these are shown instead. contour lines, lines, strike and dip symbols, are represented with various symbols as indicated by the map key. Whereas topographic maps are produced by the in conjunction with the states, geologic maps are usually produced by the individual . There are almost no geologic map resources for some states, while a few states, such as , are extensively mapped geologically.

Two 1:625,000 scale maps cover the basic geology for the UK. More detailed sheets are available at scales of 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:10,000. The 1:625,000 and 1:250,000 scales show both onshore and offshore geology (the 1:250,000 series covers the entire UK ), whilst other scales generally cover exposures on land only. continental shelf
Sheets of all scales (though not for all areas) fall into two categories:
maps (previously known as maps) show both bedrock the deposits on top of it. Superficial deposit solid and driftand
maps (previously known as maps) show the underlying rock, without superficial deposits. Bedrock solid
The maps are superimposed over a topographic map base produced by , and use symbols to represent fault lines, strike and dip or geological units, etc. Colors are used to represent different geological units. Explanatory booklets (memoirs) are produced for many sheets at the 1:50,000 scale. Ordnance Survey boreholes
Small scale thematic maps (1:1,000,000 to 1:100,000) are also produced covering , , , , etc. geochemistry gravity anomaly magnetic anomaly groundwater
Although BGS maps show the and employ an OS base map, sheet boundaries are not based on the grid. The 1:50,000 sheets originate from earlier 'one inch to the mile' (1:63,630) coverage utilising the pre-grid Ordnance Survey One Inch Third Edition as the base map. Current sheets are a mixture of modern field mapping at 1:10,000 redrawn at the 1:50,000 scale and older 1:63,630 maps reproduced on a modern base map at 1:50,000. In both cases the original OS Third Edition sheet margins and numbers are retained. The 1:250,000 sheets are defined using lines of latitude and longitude, each extending 1 north-south and 2 east-west. National Grid
