This guide offers simple and practical advice for many common canine symptoms and illnesses. It is written by dog lovers who understand that while there is no substitute for a Veterinarian, there are often simple things that can be done to help.
The Dog Health Guide Is a Committed Partner for Keeping Your Dog Healthy
We believe that every dog owner needs to be an advocate for their dog's health. This means knowing the facts so that when faced with any kind of canine disease, you can have a productive conversation with your Veterinarian.
Our thinking on different illnesses is based on the common sense advice of dog owners and information from leading Veterinary authorities. Check back often since every week we will be adding information on another canine disease.
We try and provide home remedies wherever possible, and never intend for the advice to be a substitute for a medical professional that knows your dog's breed and health. Whether discussing rice for diarrhea or treating arthritis in dogs, you'll hopefully find our approach helpful.
The Dog Health Guide also tries to focus on specific dog symptoms such as canine cough and then helps you determine if the cough is due to canine kennel cough, coccidiosis dogs, or canine parasites such as heartworm or roundworm.
Please write to us with your suggestions and ideas or if you didn't find the information you were looking for. Our email address is info@dog-health-guide.org.
All suggestions will be reviewed by our editors and posted for the benefit of our readers. Also, please send pictures of your dog. We'd love to meet him or her.
The information in Dog-Health-Guide.org is not intended to replace the advice of a Veterinarian or other Pet Health Professional. Click here for more information on the Dog Health Guide.
