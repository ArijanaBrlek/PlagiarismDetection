Important Safety Information for Humate-P
®
Humate-P is contraindicated in individuals with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic response to antihemophilic factor or von Willebrand factor preparations.®
Thromboembolic events have been reported in VWD patients receiving coagulation factor replacement, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis. Caution should be exercised and antithrombotic measures should be considered.
Humate-P is derived from human plasma. As with all plasma-derived products, the risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent, cannot be completely eliminated.®
Although few adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Humate-P, the most commonly reported are allergic-anaphylactic reactions, including urticaria (hives), chest tightness, rash, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling), shock, chills and fever, and hypervolemia (abnormally high blood volume).®

Helixate FS is a recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) product used to treat hemophilia A when there is a demonstrated deficiency of FVIII, a plasma clotting factor.®
Helixate FS should be administered cautiously in patients with previous hypersensitivity to constituents of FVIII or known sensitivity to mouse or hamster protein.®
Helixate FS should not be used by people with von Willebrand disease because it does not contain von Willebrand factor—a different protein associated with a different bleeding disorder. For more information about von Willebrand disease, please visit .® allaboutbleeding.com
