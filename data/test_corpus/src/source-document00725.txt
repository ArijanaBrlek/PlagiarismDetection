The alphalives team is in need of more dating advisors for Asian cities. Dating advisors would provide guidance for visiting foreigners on how to date locals in an efficient manner (with a substantial chance of success for a love relationship).
Definitely not wanted is advice on how to hire prostitutes. Furthermore, please be aware that the service, the alphalives team is looking for, does not include introducing visiting foreigners to specific persons. The advice shall be on locations, and on how to play the mating game there.
Furthermore, while a visiting foreigner may or may not be interested in a marriage, the dating advice is not to be misunderstood as marriage matchmaking. It is best to assume that the visiting foreigner is interested in a long-term love relationship, with a marriage not considered earlier than after the love relationship has gone on for a few years.
The alphalives team does not collect a commission from the guides (dating advisors). We just forward the advisor's contact details to the visiting foreigner who is a member of our site. Payments will be made by the visiting foreigner directly to the guide (dating advisor).
Interested parties please contact us at:
