There are so many ideas to choose from when planning games. However, It’s best to avoid games that cause embarrassment. A shower is not the occasion to make people look foolish or stupid, especially the bride-to-be. Of course, if you are hosting a small event where the guests all know each other, then ice breaker games may not be necessary, because everyone will have plenty to talk about. Whatever games you choose, make them fit the venue and the age and abilities of the guests.
What follows are just some of several entertaining games you can consider. Tailoring the to fit the personalities of the guests, the venue, and the theme will ensure that everyone has an enjoyable time. A bridal shower is meant to honor the bride-to-be and to celebrate this new stage in her life, not to make fun of her.ice breaker games

Guess How Many
Remember the games you played at birthday parties when you were a child? Well, they’re just as much fun when you are older. One you could start the party off with is
“Guess How Many”. For this, you need a large see-through container with a lid, the sort of one that can be used to store pasta. Decide what you want to put in the container. You could choose jellybeans or assorted wrapped sweets, mini chocolate bars, spring bulbs (depending upon the time of year), or whatever your imagination can think of. Be sure to record the exact number of items you place in the container.
As the guests arrive, point them in the direction of the container that you have placed in a prominent position. Ask them to guess the amount and write the number, along with their name, on slips of paper that you have set out by the container. Then, when there is a transition between activities, announce the winner of the game (whoever’s guess is the closest to the amount) and award the container and its contents to that person.
Pass the Parcel
Another fun ice breaker game is “Pass the Parcel.” Select a gift, perhaps a bar of luxury soap or a fancy candle. Wrap it in layers of different wrapping paper to correspond to the number of guests. Put the music on, and invite everyone to pass the parcel to the person sitting next to him or her. When the music stops, whoever is holding the parcel gets to unwrap one layer.
Start the music again; carry on passing the parcel, stopping the music, unwrapping the parcel and so on. The person holding the parcel with the last layer of wrapping paper gets to keep the gift. To add a little twist to the games, as each person unwraps a layer, they can share a little anecdote or memory about the bride or groom, nothing rude or unkind, but something positive and upbeat.
Memory Tray Games
“Memory Tray” is also one of the popular ice breaker games. Select about fifteen items. Purchase them new, including a tray, and consider small kitchen utensils, such as a vegetable peeler, nutmeg grater, garlic press, tea strainer, measuring spoons, bottle opener, pastry brush, in short all those must-have culinary items we can’t possibly do without.
To keep the cost down, check out your local Dollar Store for affordable items. Spread the items on the tray, and cover everything with the tea towel. Distribute a sheet of paper and a pencil to each of the guests. Remove the towel, and show everyone the items on the tray. Let them have about two minutes, then cover the tray again. Everyone then has another two minutes to write down everything he or she can remember. The person who lists the most number of correct items wins a special prize, such as a fancy jar of Herbes de Provence, while the bride-to-be receives the tray, tea towel and the kitchen items.
Lawn Games: Croquet and Bocce
If you are planning a garden party, then lawn games such as croquet and bocce can add that fun, competitive edge and get people out of their chairs and mingling. Croquet and bocce sets are reasonably priced, but if you’re on a budget then ask around: someone is bound to have a set stashed away in the back of their garage or in the attic.
Games in the Park: Frisbee Golf
Should the get-together be a picnic in the park, then Frisbee golf is really a popular game. Make sure you have one frisbee of a different color or design for each guest. Set up the course with six or eight different targets or ‘holes’. You can plan fewer or more holes, depending upon how much time you want to allot to the game.
Targets can be trees, bushes, playground equipment, whatever you can find in the park. Provide scorecards and pencils. Each person must keep track of the number of throws needed to hit each target. The person to complete the course with the fewest number of throws wins. The prize can be a special type of frisbee such as glow-in-the dark one. The other guests get to keep their frisbees as consolation prizes.
Games on the Beach: Volleyball and Sandcastles
A party on the beach just cries out for beach volleyball, while sandcastle contests will appeal to the less active, more creative guests. Provide everyone with a bucket and spade, get the camera ready and have some fun.
Prizes can be awarded for the biggest, most detailed, prettiest, and most realistic, with the bride-to-be acting as judge. Tubes of sunblock and moisturizing lotion, beach mats and beach towels make great prizes. Of course, all the participants get to keep their buckets and spades.
