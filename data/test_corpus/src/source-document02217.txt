Draining into Bristol Bay, the mighty Nushagak River remains Alaska's crown jewel King Salmon fishing destination. Deep in the lush Togiak National Forest, 20 to 50 Nushagak River King Salmon hook-ups a day are the norm during the peak. Sought by elite anglers worldwide, the Nushagak River fishing experience is more affordable than you realize. While many tent camps use the term Nushagak Alaska Fishing Lodge loosely, Bristol Bay Adventures boast the only true lodge on the Nushagak river. Perched on a bluff overlooking the "Nush", our Alaska fishing lodge has permanent structures, telephone and high-speed Internet services. Dine in our great room to gourmet meals. Enjoy the comfort of cozy cabins, with indoor plumbing, hot water, comfy beds and a spectacular view of the Nushagak River from your deck. Roughly 700 years ago, native Alaskans chose to setup their hunting and fishing camp where our lodge stands today. Wild game trails brought caribou through their outpost for centuries. An Alaska tidal fishery, the river's deep slough by the lodge is one of the main Nushagak River fish holding areas as chrome bright King Salmon barrel past the mud-flat down river, west of Black point. This makes our Alaska fishing lodge, which sits on 160 private acres, a superb Nushagak River fishing hole to catch King Salmon still fresh and feisty off Bristol Bay. These wild Alaska King Salmon can peel line at mind numbing speed, smoking your reel and sometimes spooling even the most experienced anglers. On an average day as many as 20 float planes ferry anglers from other Alaska fishing lodges for a day of angling in this unparalleled fishery. Stay at our Alaska Fishing lodge and savor the thrill only Bristol Bay Adventures can provide. Nushagak river fishing is synonymous with King Salmon fishing. Discover what a fishing vacation to the wild frontier of Alaska can be, action packed, yet peaceful and comfortable.
