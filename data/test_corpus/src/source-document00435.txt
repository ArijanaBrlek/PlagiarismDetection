The automotive recycling industry - with $10 billion in (U.S. and Canada) sales annually - plays a necessary and crucial role in the efficient, ecological disposal of inoperable motor vehicles. Although sometimes known as auto salvage dealers, professional automotive recyclers deal strictly in the recycling of motor vehicles - i.e., domestic and foreign automobiles, light and heavy-duty trucks, buses and motorcycles.
Automotive recycling serves a vital role in preserving natural resources and reducing the demand for scarce landfill space. For example, each year approximately 95 percent of vehicles retired from use are processed for recycling. The recycling of these vehicles saves an estimated 85 million barrels of oil that would have been used in the manufacturing of new or replacement parts. Additional energy and resource conservation is realized by recycling rebuildable "core" parts to the automotive parts rebuilding industry.
In addition to conserving natural resources, automotive recycling plays an important role in reducing air and water pollution, and solid waste generation. Automotive recyclers must abide by stringent local and national regulations on dealing with waste generated by salvaged automobiles. Many individual automotive recyclers have also instituted their own unique programs to further reduce the potential effects of harmful materials to their businesses and communities.
In 2006, the gross annual revenues are an estimated $10 billion.
In 1997, auto recyclers acquired 4.7 million vehicles for the purpose of recycling.
Recycling vehicles provides enough steel to produce almost 13 million new vehicles.

Automotive recycling decreases insurance rates by purchasing inoperative vehicles from insurance companies, thus allowing for recovery of financial losses. These vehicles came primarily from individual owners and salvage auctions.
Automotive recycling keeps highways and roads clear of abandoned and disabled vehicles by providing a place to deposit these vehicles.
