Testing Your Speed
Once you have completed the Tactus Keyboarding Program, it is recommended that you keep track of your progress by testing your keyboarding speed periodically. Tactus has developed a program to do this; the service is free of charge. You can choose between a test for people who mostly COMPOSE what they type and a test for people who mostly COPY what they type.
