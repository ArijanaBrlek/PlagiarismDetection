Barbecued Baby Back Ribs Recipe
For this baby back rib recipe you will need a few slabs of pork baby back ribs, your favorite barbecue sauce and my special seasoning blend which is described below.
These ribs are the simplest to cook. Therefore they don't require quite as much time cooking on the grill as pork spare ribs. Therefore, be sure not to overcook your baby backs.
Ingredients for seasoning blend: unsalted meat tenderizer, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper.
To prepare seasoning blend mix equal amounts of the listed ingredients in small bowl. Mix thoroughly to ensure seasonings are well blended. Place seasoning blend in empty shaker. Shake well before using. Leftover seasoning should be stored in cool, dry place.
1. Season your ribs and refrigerate the night before your barbecue cookout. Allow ribs to come to room temperature before placing on the grill.
2. While ribs are coming to room temperature go ahead and start up the grill. If you are using a gas grill I feel sorry for you, because foods cooked over coals taste so much better. If you're using charcoals allow briquettes to burn off until they are ash grey and glowing. Prepare coals for direct heating by spreading them in a single layer over the entire bottom surface of the grill.
3. Start the ribs off by grilling them bone side down about three inches from the heat source. It's important that once your ribs begin to cook turn them frequently. You can keep your baby back ribs from drying out by basting them frequently while they cook. I use a simple basting mixture of water, vinegar and seasoning blend to taste. This also works well in putting out fires.
4. When you think the ribs are nearly done add your favorite barbecue sauce. Apply sauce to one side of the ribs, let them cook for a while and repeat the process for the other side of the ribs. This step can be done multiply times until the ribs are done.
