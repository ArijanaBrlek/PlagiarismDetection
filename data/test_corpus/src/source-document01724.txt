Was There a UFO In Meriden?
File this under fascinating. Fireworks may not have been the only thing lighting up the night sky at the July 4th Fireworks display in the town of Meriden last week. Several eyewitnesses claim that they saw what can only be described as a U.F.O. The firework festivities were held in Meriden's , on July 3rd, and other witnesses posting to YouTube claim they saw a similar "UFO" in Indiana the next night. Another person describes the Unidentified Flying Object as looking "like a plane on fire". You can view Ben Smithwick's amazing exclusive cell phone video of "Aliens in Connecticut" here:
