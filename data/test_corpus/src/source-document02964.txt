1.)Welcome to our reading room. Many times the poetry that leaves our hands to be placed on the printed page would be better understood if orally delivered to our audience. This reading room has been set up for you to enjoy the heart songs of some of our poets for out of the abundance of our hearts our lips speak. So turn on your sound, pour a cup of coffee and enjoy the nuances that can only come through the spoken word.
