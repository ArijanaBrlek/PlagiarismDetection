A longtime fan of science fiction, in 1960 Roddenberry put together a proposal for , a science fiction television series set on board a large interstellar space ship dedicated to exploring the galaxy. Some influences Roddenberry noted were 's tales of the , 's stories, and the 1956 science fiction film . Parallels have also been drawn with the 1954 TV sci-fi series , a much less sophisticated that nevertheless included many of the elements -- organization, crew relationships, missions, elements of bridge layout, and even some technology -- that made up . Roddenberry also drew heavily from the novels depicting a daring sea captain exercising broad discretionary authority on distant missions of noble purpose; his Kirk character was more or less Hornblower in space. Roddenberry had extensive experience in writing that were particularly popular television fare at the time, and pitched the show to the network as a " to the stars."Star Trek A.

In 1964, Roddenberry secured a three-year development deal with leading independent TV production company (founded by comedy stars and ). In Roddenberry's original concept, the protagonist was named Captain of the "S.S. ". Eventually, this character became Captain . The first pilot episode, "", was made in 1964, with actor in the role of Pike after Roddenberry's first choice, had reportedly turned it down.

At a time when was still firmly entrenched in many areas of the United States, Roddenberry envisaged a multi-racial and mixed-gender crew, based on his assumption that racial prejudice and would not exist in the 23rd century. He also included recurring characters from alien races, including , who was half human and half , united under the banner of the . racial segregation sexism Spock Vulcan United Federation of Planets
Other innovative features involved solutions to basic production problems. The idea of the faster-than-light was not new to science fiction, but it allowed a narrative device that permitted the Enterprise to quickly traverse space. The matter transporter, by which crew members "beamed" from place to place, solved the problem of moving characters quickly from the ship to a planet, a spacecraft landing sequence for each episode being prohibitively expensive. The famous flip-open communicator was introduced as a plot device to strand the characters in challenging situations by malfunctioning, being lost or stolen, or out of range; absent such a device, the characters could simply beam up at the first sign of trouble. The flip-open communicator has been copied in many popular cell phone designs from the mid-1990s on.Star Trek warp drive [7]
The concept was first offered to the network, but the channel turned it down for the more mainstream production, . was then offered to NBC, who commissioned and then turned down the first pilot (NBC executives would later be quoted as saying that the initial pilot episode was 'too cerebral'). However, the NBC executives were favorably impressed with the concept and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: "". Only the character of (played by ) remained from the original pilot, and only two cast members ( and ) carried on to the series.

Barrett, later Roddenberry's wife, also did the voice for the ship's computer. Roddenberry's inclusion of the Asian Sulu and black Uhura, both of them intelligent, well-spoken professionals, was a bold move when most television characters of the time were white and those who weren't were often presented in a highly stereotypical manner.

Jefferies' starship concepts arrived at a final saucer-and-cylinders design that became a template for all subsequent Federation space vehicles. Jefferies also developed the main set for the bridge (based on an original design by Pato Guzman) and used his practical experience as a airman and his knowledge of aircraft design to come up with a sleek, functional, bridge layout.

The series introduced television viewers to many ideas which later became common in science fiction films: warp drive, , force fields, wireless hand-held communicators and scanners, , desktop computer terminals, laser surgery, starship , and computer speech synthesis. Although these concepts had numerous antecedents in sci-fi literature and film, they had never before been integrated in one presentation and most of them were certainly new to TV. Even the ship's automatic doors were a novel feature in 1966.

During the show's second season, the threat of cancellation loomed. The show's devoted conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning NBC to keep the show on the air. Its fans succeeded in gaining a third season; however, NBC subsequently moved the show to the at 10 PM. Roddenberry reduced his direct involvement in before the start of the final season to protest the changed timeslot, and was replaced by . NBC then substantially reduced budget which brought about a marked decline in the quality of many third season episodes. As Nichelle Nichols writes: [8] fanbase [9] Friday Night Death Slot [10] Star Trek Fred Freiberger Star Trek's [11]
"While NBC paid lip service to expanding audience, it [now] slashed our production budget until it was actually ten percent lower than it had been in our first season....This is why in the third season you saw fewer outdoor location shots, for example. Top writers, top guest stars, top anything you needed was harder to come by. Thus, demise became a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I can assure you, that is exactly as it was meant to be."Star Trek'sStar Trek's [12]
The series was canceled in its third season, despite the protests of a renewed letter writing campaign. However, the marketing personnel of the network complained to management that the series' cancellation was premature. It turned out that after using new techniques for of the viewing audience, they found the audience was highly desirable for advertisers to the point where they considered the series a highly profitable property.

The relatively young, Russian navigator Ensign Chekov was added in the second season. There may be some truth to the unofficial story that the Soviet newspaper complained that there were no Russians among the culturally diverse characters. However, studio documentation suggests that the intention was to introduce a character with more appeal to teenagers, especially girls. Walter Koenig noted in the 40th (2006) anniversary special of that he doubted the Pravda rumor since Star Trek was never shown on Soviet television.

The three main characters were Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, with writers often playing the different personalities off each other: Kirk was passionate and often aggressive, but with a sly sense of humor; Spock was coolly logical; and McCoy was sardonic but always compassionate. In many stories the three clashed, with Kirk forced to make a tough decision while Spock advocated the logical but sometimes callous path and McCoy (or "Bones," as Kirk nicknamed him, short for "sawbones," a traditional, slightly pejorative nickname for a surgeon) insisted on doing whatever would cause the least harm. McCoy and Spock had a sparring relationship that masked their true affection and respect for each other, and their constant arguments became very popular with viewers.
The character Spock was at first rejected by network officials who feared his vaguely "satanic" appearance (with pointed ears and eyebrows) might prove upsetting to some viewers. The network had even airbrushed out Spock's pointed ears and eyebrows from publicity materials sent to network affiliates. Spock however went on to become one of the most popular characters on the show, as did McCoy's impassioned country-doctor personality. Spock, in fact, became a sex symbol of sorts to many young girls--something no one connected with the show had expected. Leonard Nimoy notes that the question of Spock's extraordinary sex appeal emerged "almost any time I talked to someone in the press...I never give it a thought....to try to deal with the question of Mr. Spock as a sex symbol is silly."

The show's theme tune, immediately recognizable by many, was written by , and has been featured in a number of spin-off episodes and motion pictures. The lyrics for the introduction were written by Gene Roddenberry without Courage's knowledge and with no intention that they would ever be sung. Roddenberry nevertheless obtained a 50% share of the music's performance royalties - motivating Courage to leave the series. Later episodes used stock recordings from Courage's earlier work.

[] edit Dramatic underscore
For budgetary reasons, this series made significant use of "tracked" music, or music written for other episodes that was re-used in later episodes. Of the 79 episodes that were broadcast, only 31 had complete or partial original dramatic underscores created specifically for them. The remainder of the music in any episode was tracked from a different episode. Which episodes would have new music was mostly the decision of Robert H. Justman, the Associate Producer during the first two seasons.
Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and re-used in, the episode. Some of these final music credits were occasionally incorrect.
Beyond the short works of "source" music (music whose source is seen or acknowledged onscreen) created for specific episodes, eight composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore during the series run: , , , , , Samuel Matlovsky, Joseph Mullendore, and . The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Steiner composed the original music for thirteen episodes and it is his instrumental arrangement of Alexander Courage's main theme that is heard over many of the end title credits of the series. Alexander Courage George Duning Jerry Fielding Gerald Fried Sol Kaplan Fred Steiner
The tracked musical underscores were chosen and edited to the episode by the music editors, principal of whom were Robert Raff (most of Season One), Jim Henrikson (Season One and Two), and Richard Lapham (Season Three). [19]
The original recordings of the music of some episodes were released in the United States commercially on the label.
