Health food shops have shelves stocked high with many products containing Chondroitin & Glucosamine -so what makes Cortaflex different?
Cortaflex does not rely on the larger glucosamine and chondroitin molecules... instead, Cortaflex provides the body with the specific amino acids and saccharides (Glutamine, Glucuronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Glycine and Proline) which are the building blocks of these compounds - your body can then actually make its own glucosamine and chondroitin. This is why Cortaflex is so much more effective than any glucosamine and chondroitin supplement.
In other words in , the (large) molecules of Chondroitin and are already broken down into the (smaller molecule sized) Amino Acid isolates and Aminosaccharides allowing more efficient absorption of the key nutritional ingredients into where they are needed - the cells in the cartilage of the joints - to promote healthy joint function. .Cortaflex Glucosamine For more information on this mechanism click here
Human Cortaflex
Human Cortaflex comes in two forms - the (normal!) Extra Strength Cortaflex Capsules or the HA Capsules. There are 60 one-a-day capsules in the normal bottle and 30 one-a-day capsules in the HA bottle.
Cortaflex HA Capsules are double the strength of the regular capsules and have the addition of Hyaluronic Acid - a major component of Synovial Fluid (joint lubricating fluid). For most people the normal Extra Strength Cortaflex Capsules will be sufficient but, for those wanting a quick start to more healthy joints (or for those who's joints have experienced excessive wear and tear), Cortaflex HA Capsules offer the extra boost provided by the remarkable effects of Hyaluronic Acid.
All Human Cortaflex Capsules are sugar, salt, gluten, gelatine and shellfish free.
