The Northwest Regional Technology Center (NWRTC) is a virtual resource center supporting regional preparedness, response, and recovery by enabling homeland security solutions for emergency responder communities and federal, state, and local stakeholders in the Northwest.
To help facilitate and accelerate homeland security technology solutions, the center will:
Work with regional emergency management and public safety professionals to define and prioritize technology needs.
Coordinate and lead regional efforts to test, demonstrate, and deploy new and emerging technologies.
Conduct forums focusing for prevention and emergency preparedness, response, and recovery.
Provide information and expertise on new and emerging technologies, including chem-bio detection, analysis, and forensics; radiological detection; information analytics; explosives detection; and situational awareness.
Regional Homeland Security Summit
A giant step toward a regional partnership was taken on May 28, 2008, when key representatives from ten western states and the Territory of Guam embraced the idea of developing a concept to partner with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratoriesâ€”specifically the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Idaho National Laboratory. PNNL and INL would focus on the needs of the states by helping to identify technology needs and requirements, establish priorities, and provide unbiased technical support and training. National labs can also serve as agents to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the states. Participants also gained a new awareness of the homeland security that have resulted from national laboratory science and technology. capabilities
