Beethoven
Our students studied the life of classical composer Ludwig Van Beethoven recently. We used the "Stories of the Great Composers, Book 1" from Alfred Publishing. This is a short summary of the text the students read. Beethoven was born in Germany in 1770. He died at age 56 in 1827. He came from a musical family. His father began teaching him to play the piano and violin when he was 4 years old. He was known as one of the best pianists of his day. Mozart said that Beethoven would be a famous musician one day. Beethoven lost his hearing gradually between age 30 and 50. He still wrote compositions even after he lost his hearing. Before he lost his hearing, he went to the woods and creeks / brooks to listen to sounds of nature. He was 'storing up' sounds in his mind so he could remember what each sound was like. He used his knowledge and memory of sounds to write beautiful music even after he lost his hearing. One of his symphonies was Symphony No. 6, also known as the Pastoral Symphony. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. A few other compositions by Beethoven were (Moonlight Sonata) Piano Sonata in C-Sharp Minor and Fur Elise. Our students created the questions and we made a multiple choice quiz based on their reading.
