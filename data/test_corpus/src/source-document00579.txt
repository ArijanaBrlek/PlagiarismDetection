The nation's first outcome-based contract for maintenance allows a private company to manage and operate some of Virginia's interstate system. VDOT establishes the Smart Travel brand for its comprehensive, first-in-the-nation program of intelligent transportation systems. Smart Tag electronic toll collection is introduced on the Dulles Toll Road. TEA-21, a new funding plan, boosts Virginia's share of federal revenue by 62 percent over six years.

The initative is launched. It proves to be quick-fix paving program, saving time and money. A cost-estimating system allows VDOT to obtain more accurate project forecasts. The Highway Safety Corridor program is launched on key stretches of interstates. Traffic violators may receive higher fines for infractions in the corridors. Hampton, Richmond and Virginia Beach take over management of local road construction in a legislated VDOT program called “First Cities.” A right of way and utilities management system is developed, instantly giving managers the status of highway projects.
