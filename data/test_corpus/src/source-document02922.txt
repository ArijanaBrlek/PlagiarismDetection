Medici Offers Elegant, Traditional Brunch
Service Even Overcomes Spilled Mimosas

If you've been paying attention, you've probably noticed me raving about the at Lake Las Vegas, a beautiful upscale resort perched on the scenic lake about 25 miles east of town. It offers unparalleled service, amenities, and luxury, all in a setting that will make you never want to leave. Ritz-Carlton
One of the focal points of the resort is Medici, the elegantly designed restaurant driven by Executive Chef Stephen Marshall's unique take on Pan-Mediterranean cuisine. I had a chance to visit for the weekend brunch and came away impressed with the experience.
First, you have to take a moment to appreciate the room. Done in soft, creamy yellows with plush furnishings, rich fabrics, and dramatic floral arrangements, its tall windows overlook the resort's gardens and, beyond that, the lake. It is the definition of luxury, with a strong dash of romance thrown in for good measure. Medici is undeniably one of the most beautiful restaurants in town.
The weekend brunch is of the traditional restaurant variety. The term has been bastardized by the gigantic buffets on the Strip, where mimosas and breakfast items in serving trays at lunchtime qualify. Instead of trying to reach under a sneeze guard, at Medici you choose from a variety of items on a fixed-price menu, and they are served to you at your table.
You can start at the drink bar or have the servers bring your choice of a breakfast cocktail. They specialize in Absolut vodka drinks, along with bloody Mary and screwdriver makings, or you can go with the mimosas, which are miles better than the cheap champagne-and-orange-juice concoctions you'll find at a $10 Sunday brunch.
Next, you select from a short list of appetizers including a crab salad or Caesar salad, shrimp cocktail, mixed greens, or latkes (potato pancakes) with smoked salmon and quail eggs.
For main courses, they have prime rib Oscar, eggs Sardu, osso bucco, bouillabaisse, pasta puttanesca, or lobster scrambled eggs with mascarpone and grilled salmon.
In other, words if you're looking for plain scrambled eggs and bacon, this isn't the brunch for you, although they do have a kids menu with slightly more recognizable fare including, chocolate chip pancakes and macaroni and cheese.
As noted, everything has a Mediterranean twist, with elements of traditional Greek, Italian, Moroccan, and Middle Eastern flavors woven throughout. The latkes were a delight, crispy with just enough of a seasoned tang to be noticed underneath the generous fresh smoked salmon and quail egg. The eggs sardu, a poached confection in a creamy hollandaise sauce, was rich and satisfying in a high-cholesterol kind of way.
The only real disappointment was the scrambled eggs with lobster, mascarpone, and grilled salmon, a fascinating idea on paper that didn't translate to the plate as well as one would have imagined. Too many conflicting flavors competing for attention.
After your main course, a dessert display featuring lots of delicate chocolate, pastry, and fruit items is brought to the table. The pieces at my serving were worthy of a display in the museum of food art and were a perfect, and relatively light, cap to some of the heavier brunch items I worked my way through.
Outstanding service is a hallmark of the Ritz-Carlton chain and Medici fits perfectly into that corporate mindset. My team was unfailingly gracious and professional -- so much so that the little incident involving a tray of mimosas and my lap (something usually only seen in movies) was quickly forgiven as a fluke that only happens to people with the kind of luck I usually have. Seriously, though, the wait staff at Medici was tremendous and I can't say enough nice things about them.
All of this elegance, fine food, and terrific service come at a price of course -- $37 to be exact. The fixed price includes a drink, appetizer, main course, and the desert presentation. Yes, that's expensive -- significantly more for significantly less food than you can gorge yourself on most weekend brunch buffets on the Strip. But if you want a truly elegant, traditional brunch experience without long lines and food warming under hot lamps, Medici is definitely a place to consider.
