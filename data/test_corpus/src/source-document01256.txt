Extensive Guide to Night-time Light Data Now Available
Source: NASA
Night-time light imagery from remote sensing data sources offers a uniquely human view of the Earths surface, as it is due almost entirely to some form of human activity. This illustrated guide introduces users to the types of night-time light data available, the characteristics, and the limitations. The second part of the guide examines how the data source has been and may be used to derive useful information about human presence and activities on Earth. Topics range from population and light pollution to economic activity, greenhouse gas emissions, and using night-time lights to help with disaster management. The ecological ramifications of night-time lighting are also considered. The final section of the guide explores other potential sources of night-time light data and how future systems may enhance existing capabilities for understanding the human environment through the observation of lights at night. The Guide was developed by former Earth Institute Fellow Christopher Doll, with support from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center () operated by CIESIN.
