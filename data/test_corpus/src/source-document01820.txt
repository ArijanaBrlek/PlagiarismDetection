Department of Energy approves PNNL's future campus plans
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Capability Replacement Laboratory project is building the replacement facilities. Enlarged View
The U.S. Department of Energy has approved Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's 300 Area Capability Replacement Laboratory (CRL) project scope, opening the way for construction throughout the PNNL campus.
The CRL will contain replacement facilities to house capabilities and staff from the Hanford Site's 300 Area. As part of DOE's Hanford Site cleanup, PNNL must leave much of the 300 Area by the end of 2011.
Most recently, the DOE approved PNNL's funding approach for three new facilities: the , a federally funded complex; and the and , both privately funded buildings. Physical Sciences Facility Computational Sciences Biological Sciences Facilities
In late 2005, DOE Deputy Undersecretary Clay Sell gave approval to complete building designs for the CRL. Congressman Doc Hastings, who has been a strong champion for the Lab's replacement facilities, announced this action in a . press release
DOE is now in the process of approving the Laboratory's design plans and once design plans are approved, construction will begin. We expect to begin construction on all three facilities this fiscal year.
PNNL will also remain in four facilities that it already occupies in the 300 Area.
