Medical Marijuana ID Card Program
The Medical Marijuana Program (MMP) was established by the California Department of Health Services in 2004 to facilitate the registration of qualified patients and their caregivers, through a statewide identification system. Participation in the program is voluntary for patients and the patient's primary caregiver. Through their county of residence, qualified patients and their caregivers may apply for and be issued an identification card. This card is used to verify those patients and caregivers that have authorization to possess, grow, transport and/or use medical marijuana in California.
The Sonoma County Medical Marijuana Identification Card (MMIC) program provides patients with an ID card to show they have a recommendation from their physician to use marijuana for medicinal purposes. The card can assist law enforcement officials in determining whether an individual using marijuana meets the requirements of the Compassionate Use Act, which states that, with the recommendation of a physician, a patient may obtain and use marijuana for personal medical purposes.
