C.B.P. News Release CBP Seizes $200K in Undeclared Currency; Arrest 1 at Texas Port (Wednesday, December 31, 2008) Hidalgo, Texas – U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers conducting outbound inspections at the Hidalgo port of entry seized $200,635 in undeclared currency. The seizure occurred at about 12:45 p.m., on Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2008, at Hidalgo International Bridge. A CBP officer conducting outbound (southbound) inspections referred a 2008 GMC Sierra pickup driven by a 31-year-old male Mexican citizen from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico for a secondary examination. The driver gave a negative declaration for currency in excess of $10,000, weapons or ammunition. During the examination, CBP officers noted discrepancies in the vehicle’s spare tire. A non-intrusive imaging system scan indicated anomalies within spare tire. CBP officers conducted an intensive examination of the area and discovered 49 bundles containing U.S. currency within the spare tire. CBP officers seized a total of $200,635 in undeclared currency. CBP officers arrested the driver on federal bulk cash smuggling charges and turned him over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents who investigated the seizure.

Failure to declare may result in seizure of the currency and/or arrest. An individual may petition for the return of currency seized by CBP officers, but the petitioner must prove that the source and intended use of the currency was legitimate. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between the official ports of entry. CBP is charged with keeping terrorists and terrorist weapons out of the country while enforcing hundreds of U.S. laws.
