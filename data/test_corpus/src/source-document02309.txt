Shrub-steppe History
History
Since the first contact with European man, which occurred when the Lewis and Clark expedition traversed the region in 1805 and 1806, the North American shrub-steppe has undergone substantial and irretrievable change. Unfortunately, of the few written records left by the early explorers, traders and trappers regarding the original, pristine condition, those that have survived are sparse indeed.
