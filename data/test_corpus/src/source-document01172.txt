Some risk factors are present before women become pregnant. These risk factors include certain physical and social characteristics of women, problems that have occurred in previous pregnancies, and certain disorders women already have.
Physical Characteristics
The age, weight, and height of women affect risk during pregnancy. Girls aged 15 and younger are at increased risk of preeclampsia (a type of high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy). Young girls are also at increased risk of having underweight (small-for-gestational-age) or undernourished babies. Women aged 35 and older are at increased risk of problems such as high blood pressure, gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy), and complications during labor.
Women who weigh less than 100 pounds before becoming pregnant are more likely to have small, underweight babies. Obese women are more likely to have very large babies,which may be difficult to deliver. Also, obese women are more likely to develop gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.
Women shorter than 5 feet are more likely to have a small pelvis, which may make movement of the fetus through the pelvis and vagina (birth canal) difficult during labor. For example, the fetus's shoulder is more likely to lodge against the pubic bone. This complication is called shoulder dystocia (see ). Also, short women are more likely to have preterm labor and a baby who has not grown as much as expected. Labor and Delivery Complications: Shoulder Dystocia
Structural abnormalities in the reproductive organs increase the risk of a miscarriage. Examples are a double uterus or a weak (incompetent) cervix that tends to open (dilate) as the fetus grows.
Social Characteristics
Being unmarried or in a lower socioeconomic group increases the risk of problems during pregnancy. The reason these characteristics increase risk is unclear but is probably related to other characteristics that are more common among these women. For example, these women are more likely to smoke and less likely to consume a healthy diet and to obtain appropriate medical care.
Problems in a Previous Pregnancy
When women have had a problem in one pregnancy, they are more likely to have a problem, often the same one, in subsequent pregnancies. Such problems include having had a premature baby, an underweight baby, a baby that weighed more than 10 pounds, a baby with birth defects, a previous miscarriage, a late (postterm) delivery (after 42 weeks of pregnancy), Rh incompatibility that required a blood transfusion to the fetus, or a delivery that required a cesarean section. If women have had a baby who died shortly after birth, they are also more likely to have problems in subsequent pregnancies.
Women may have a condition that tends to make the same problem recur. For example, women with diabetes are more likely to have babies that weigh more than 10 pounds at birth.
Women who had a baby with a genetic disorder or birth defect are more likely to have another baby with a similar problem. Genetic testing of the baby, even if stillborn, and of both parents may be appropriate before another pregnancy is attempted (see ). If these women become pregnant again, tests such as ultrasonography, chorionic villus sampling, and amniocentesis may help determine whether the fetus has a genetic disorder or birth defect. Genetic Disorders Detection: Genetic Screening
Having had six or more pregnancies increases the risks of very rapid labor and excessive bleeding after delivery. It also increases the risk of a mislocated placenta (placenta previa (see ). Pregnancy at High Risk: Placenta Previa
Disorders Present Before Pregnancy
Before becoming pregnant, women may have a disorder that can increase the risk of problems during pregnancy. These women should talk with a doctor and try to get in the best physical condition possible before they become pregnant. After they become pregnant, they may need special care, often from an interdisciplinary team. The team may include an obstetrician (who may also be a specialist in the disorder), a specialist in the disorder, and other health care practitioners (such as nutritionists).
Most women who have heart disease—including heart valve disorders (such as mitral valve prolapse) and some birth defects of the heart—can safely give birth to healthy children, without any permanent ill effects on heart function or life span. However, women who have heart failure before pregnancy are at considerable risk of problems.Heart Disease:
Pregnancy requires the heart to work harder. Consequently, pregnancy may worsen heart disease or cause heart disease to produce symptoms for the first time. Usually, serious problems, including death of the woman or fetus, occur only when heart disease is severe before the woman becomes pregnant. About 1% of women who have severe heart disease before becoming pregnant die as a result of the pregnancy, usually because of heart failure.
The risk of problems increases throughout pregnancy as demands on the heart increase. Pregnant women with heart disease may become unusually tired and may need to limit their activities. Rarely, women with severe heart disease are advised to have an abortion early in pregnancy. Risk is also increased during labor and delivery. After delivery, women with severe heart disease may not be out of danger for at least 6 months, depending on the type of heart disease.
Heart disease in pregnant women may affect the fetus. The fetus may be born prematurely. Women with birth defects of the heart are more likely to have children with similar birth defects. Ultrasonography can detect some of these defects before the fetus is born. If severe heart disease in a pregnant woman suddenly worsens, the fetus may die.
During labor, women who have severe heart disease may be given an epidural anesthetic, which blocks sensation in the lower spinal cord and prevents women from pushing. Pushing during labor strains the heart, because it increases the amount of blood returning to the heart. Because pushing is not possible, the baby may have to be delivered with forceps.
For women with some types of heart disease, pregnancy is inadvisable because it so increases their risk of death. Primary pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger's syndrome are examples. If women who have one of these disorders become pregnant, doctors advise them to terminate the pregnancy as early as possible.
Women who have high blood pressure (chronic hypertension) before they become pregnant are more likely to have potentially serious problems during pregnancy. These problems include preeclampsia (a type of high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy (see ), worsening of high blood pressure, a fetus that does not grow as much as expected, premature detachment of the placenta from the uterus (placental abruption), and stillbirth.High Blood Pressure: Pregnancy at High Risk: Preeclampsia
For most women with moderately high blood pressure (140/90 to 150/100 millimeters of mercury [mm Hg]), treatment with antihypertensive drugs is not recommended. Such treatment does not seem to reduce the risk of preeclampsia, premature detachment of the placenta, or a stillbirth nor to improve the growth of the fetus. However, some women are treated to prevent pregnancy from causing episodes of even higher blood pressure (which require hospitalization).
For women whose blood pressure is higher than 150/100 mm Hg, treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs is recommended (see ). Treatment can reduce the risk of stroke and other complications due to very high blood pressure. Treatment is also recommended for women who have high blood pressure and a kidney disorder because if high blood pressure is not controlled well, the kidneys may be damaged further. Antihypertensive Drugs
Most antihypertensive drugs used to treat high blood pressure can be used safely during pregnancy. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are discontinued during pregnancy, particularly during the last two trimesters. These drugs can cause severe kidney damage in the fetus. As a result, the baby may die shortly after birth.
During pregnancy, women with high blood pressure are monitored closely to make sure blood pressure is well controlled, the kidneys are functioning normally, and the fetus is growing normally. However, premature detachment of the placenta cannot be prevented or anticipated. Often, a baby must be delivered early to prevent stillbirth or complications due to high blood pressure (such as stroke) in the woman.
Having a hereditary anemia, such as sickle cell disease, hemoglobin S-C disease, and some thalassemias, increases the risk of problems during pregnancy. Before delivery, blood tests are routinely performed to check for hemoglobin abnormalities in women who are at increased risk of having these abnormalities because of race, ethnic background, or family history. Chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis may be performed to detect a hemoglobin abnormality in the fetus.Anemia:
Women who have sickle cell disease are particularly at risk of developing infections during pregnancy. Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and infections of the uterus are the most common. About one third of pregnant women who have sickle cell disease develop high blood pressure during pregnancy. A sudden, severe attack of pain, called sickle cell crisis, may occur during pregnancy as at any other time. Heart failure and blockage of arteries of the lungs by blood clots (pulmonary embolism), which may be life threatening, may also occur. Bleeding during labor or after delivery may be more severe. The fetus may grow slowly or not as much as expected. The fetus may even die. The more severe sickle cell disease was before pregnancy, the higher the risk of health problems for pregnant women and the fetus and the higher the risk of death for the fetus during pregnancy. With regular blood transfusions, women are less likely to have sickle cell crises but are more likely to reject the transfused blood. This condition, called alloimmunization, can be life threatening. Also, transfusions to pregnant women do not reduce risks for the fetus.
Women with a severe kidney disorder before pregnancy are more likely to have problems during pregnancy. Kidney function may rapidly worsen during pregnancy. High blood pressure, which often accompanies a kidney disorder, may also worsen, and preeclampsia (a type of high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy) may develop. The fetus may not grow as much as expected or may be stillborn. In pregnant women who have a kidney disorder, kidney function and blood pressure are monitored closely as is the growth of the fetus. Often, the baby must be delivered early.Kidney Disorders:
Women who have had a kidney transplant that has been in place for 2 or more years are usually able to safely give birth to healthy babies if their kidneys are functioning normally, if they have had no episodes of rejection, and if their blood pressure is normal. Many women who have a kidney disorder and who undergo hemodialysis regularly can also give birth to healthy babies.
For most women who take anticonvulsants to treat a seizure disorder, the frequency of seizures does not change during pregnancy. However, sometimes the dose of the anticonvulsant must be increased.Seizure Disorders:
Taking anticonvulsants increases the risk of birth defects (see ). Women who take anticonvulsants should discuss the risk of birth defects with an expert in the field, preferably before they become pregnant. Some women may be able to safely discontinue anticonvulsants during pregnancy, but most women should continue to take the drugs. The risks resulting from not taking the drugs (resulting in more frequent seizures, which can harm the fetus and the woman) usually outweigh the risks resulting from taking them during pregnancy.
Women who have a sexually transmitted disease may have problems during pregnancy. Chlamydial infection may cause preterm labor and premature rupture of the membranes containing the fetus. It can also cause conjunctivitis in newborns, as can gonorrhea. Syphilis in pregnant women may be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. Syphilis can cause several birth defects.Sexually Transmitted Diseases:
About one fourth of pregnant women who have untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which causes AIDS, transmit it to their baby (see ). Experts recommend that women with HIV infection take antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. When pregnant women take these drugs, the risk of transmitting HIV to their baby is reduced to less than 2%. For some women with HIV infection, delivery by cesarean section, planned in advance, may further reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the baby. Pregnancy does not seem to accelerate the progress of HIV infection in women. Viral Infections: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection
Genital herpes can be transmitted to a baby during a vaginal delivery. A baby who is infected with herpes can develop a life-threatening brain infection called herpes encephalitis. If herpes produces sores in the genital area late in pregnancy, women are usually advised to give birth by cesarean section, so that the virus is not transmitted to the baby. If no sores are present, the risk of transmission is very low.
For women who have diabetes before they become pregnant, the risks of complications during pregnancy depend on how long diabetes has been present and whether complications of diabetes, such as high blood pressure and kidney damage, are present. (In some women, diabetes develops during pregnancy; this disorder is called gestational diabetes (see ).Diabetes: Pregnancy at High Risk: Gestational Diabetes
