A weather satellite is a type of that is primarily used to monitor the and of the . Satellites can be either polar orbiting, seeing the same swath of the every 12 hours, or , hovering over the same spot on Earth by orbiting over the equator while moving at the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation.

and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. The Antarctic ozone hole is mapped from weather satellite data. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch. El Ni o
[] edit Environmental monitoring
Other environmental satellites can detect changes in the Earth's vegetation, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average. For example, the 2002 oil spill off the northwest coast of was watched carefully by the European ENVISAT, which, though not a weather satellite, flies an instrument (ASAR) which can see changes in the sea surface.
