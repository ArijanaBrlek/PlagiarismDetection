Clay Pigeon Shooting is a recognised target shooting sport . There are 2 types of Clay Pigeon Shooting, American Skeet which is administered by the NSSA (National Skeet Shooting Association) and Olympic Clay Pigeon Shooting. It was devised by Charles E. Davies, an avid grouse hunter, in 1915 and evolved to its current setup by 1923. In 1926 a contest was held to name the new sport, and Gertrude Hurlbutt, named it skeet, which is derived from the Scandinavian word for "shoot". During World War II, Clay Pigeon Shooting was used in the American military to teach gunners the principle of leading and timing on flying targets. Clay Pigeon Shooting is a recreational and competitive activity where participants attempt to break clay disks flung into the air at high speed from a variety of angles. The use of clay targets replaced the more traditional target of live birds, as a cheaper and more reliable alternative, one reason they are also called clay pigeons, not to mention the problems that would occur these days by shooting live pigeons.
