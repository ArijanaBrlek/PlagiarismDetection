Alexian Brothers Health System's Centers for Spiritual Care
For over 30 years, Alexian Brothers Health System (ABHS) has been a dedicated ministry that serves not only the physical, but also the psychological and spiritual needs of those entrusted to its care. Scientific and technological advances have enhanced the ability to care for the body. Tending the human spirit and our need for God's love has advanced similarly.
Spiritual Care is one of the clearest, visible expressions of dedication to the Congregation of Alexian Brothers' Charism and is central to ABHS's identity as a Catholic healthcare provider.
Chaplains have been present to comfort patients and their families in times of crisis, give thanks in times of joy, testify to the love of God, and at times guide our family of physicians, nurses and employees in matters of the spirit.
Our long-term goals remain constant:
To strengthen spirituality in the way we deliver care
To strengthen spirituality in our workplaces
The Center for Spiritual Care maintains effective and ongoing communication with clergy in the community, and actively supports the health promotions efforts of local churches in all denominations and faith traditions.
