 
Research Interests
My current research revolves around issues related to the economy, territoriality, nation-states, citizenship, governance, and globalization. Money has been of particular interest, from the cultural values inscribed on national currencies, to the proposals for a North American Monetary Union, to general theories of money and exchange. More recently, I have become interested in border issues, and in particular the ways that that the idea of riskboth economic and socialhas been used to discipline behaviour and promote new forms of citizenship practice. Other, ongoing research examines visual and literary narratives of national identity, with attention to both urban and wilderness representations, especially in Canada.
