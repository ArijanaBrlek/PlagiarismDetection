Welcome to Sonoma County’s Human Services Department (HSD) web site.  Our goal at HSD is to protect and improve the well-being of the individuals and families who reside in Sonoma County – especially those who cannot protect themselves.  We accomplish this by providing many different forms of assistance, including employment services, in-home support to aging and disabled individuals, Veteran’s services, foster care, food stamps, cash assistance, and eligibility for medical services.  In addition to operating the Valley of the Moon Children’s Home, an emergency shelter for children who need temporary refuge because of neglect or abuse, we operate 24-hour emergency telephone lines for reporting incidents of suspected child and/or adult abuse. These services, in addition to HSD’s partnerships with the community, contribute to the safety and security of thousands of children and families during times of financial hardship or family distress.
Our intent with this web site is to provide you with timely information about our services in a convenient manner.  As you use it, please feel free to send us your thoughts and suggestions about anything that you see or read.  We are eager to provide assistance.
We wish to thank the Board of Supervisors and the County Administrator for their on-going support in providing critical services to children and families in our community.  In addition, I wish to thank our dedicated staff and community partners who tirelessly work on behalf of our clients and working families.
