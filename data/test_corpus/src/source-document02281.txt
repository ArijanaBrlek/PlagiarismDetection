  Abstract
To investigate the prevalence of chronic forearmpain in a non-occupational community setting over a 2-year period.Objectives.
A longitudinal community-based postal questionnairesurvey conducted in the south-eastern quadrant of England.Method.
We received 2493/4172 (60%) responses at baseline andwe followed up 429 of these 2 years later: 252 responded (59%).Forearm pain prevalence was 4% at baseline and 5% at follow-up.Over 95% of those with forearm pain had pain in other areas[odds ratio 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3–1.7)] andit was most commonly associated with elbow and wrist pain. Seventy-sixper cent of those with forearm pain at baseline recovered. Atfollow-up, 78% of those with chronic forearm pain had new-onsetforearm pain.Results.
Persistent forearm pain (pain for over 2 years)was rare and the capacity for recovery was good (76%). Isolatedforearm pain as a diagnostic category is of little utility.Treating and managing forearm pain in a site-specific manneris unlikely to be successful owing to its strong associationwith pain in other areas. In the community, forearm pain lateralitywas not evident; our findings suggest that forearm pain in theworkplace is influenced by different factors to those in a communitysetting.Conclusions.
