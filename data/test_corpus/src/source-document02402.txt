 
Advance Wars 2 is the excellent strategy game for the Gameboy Advance.
Here are some multiplayer maps that I created with the game's custom map editor. Share and enjoy!

This four-player map requires you to balance offense and defense. All armies converge on the main islands, but their home countries may be defenseless!
Most of the action takes place on four connected islands in the center of the map. Here is where you'll find all the cities and factories needed to build up your forces and take down your friends. As always, everything is balanced perfectly; I didn't want the territory to become too crowded or two sparse, a common mistake with many Advance Wars maps.Center islands:
Also, note that each player can reach the main islands in the same amount of time. Where you go from there is up to you. The factories are harder to reach, becuase they're more valuable.
Everyone begins with a Lander, so you can start sending soldiers on the second turn. The ocean is wide enough, for the most part, for your ships to evade attack, with bottlenecks only on the four sides of the map.Naval vessels:
Now, here is what makes this level so great: your home islands are completely unguarded. There are almost no forests to hide inside, which means you'll have to fight in the open if you're attacked.Home islands:
Worse, notice where your home base is: right next to the beach. Your factories are far away. What does this mean? It means, dear friends, if you fail to defend your island and the beach is taken, you're dead.
An enemy Lander lands at your beach, dropping off an Infantry unit and an APC. You have nothing to defend with, because you were distracted by those bigger islands. Now, you'll have to wait halplessly , while the Infantry captures your HB and the APC blocks the way.for the next two turns
There's not a damn thing you can do. Isn't that vicious?
As you can guess, you have to carefully balance offense and defense. You must conquer territory in order to build up your armies, but you cannot forget your home country. This can be especially challenging when playing under Fog of War.Balance:
The gameplay is open-ended enough to suit any style. The key to victory is knowing how to punish opponents who rely on one style. This is great fun.
