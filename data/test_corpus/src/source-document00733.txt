Cultural Arts Coffee proudly brews Starbucks ® Coffee
The Mary G. Hardin Center for Cultural Arts’ coffee shop, Cultural Arts Coffee, has been proudly brewing the famous Starbucks® coffee for over two years now. The Coffee Shop is located in the lobby of the Mary G. Hardin Center for Cultural Arts on broad street and the hours of operation will not only allow the coffee shop to be a morning place to get your Starbuck’s® coffee but it will also be open late at night for those wanting a cup of “joe” to wrap up a night out or those just looking for a coffee house atmosphere late in the evening.
An extensive menu of Starbucks® brand espresso, iced coffee, tea, cappuccino, cider, hot chocolate and more are offered day and night along with juice, soft drinks, muffins, cheesecake and Starbucks® biscotti. The hours of operation are Monday - Thursday from 7 am - 10 pm, Friday and Saturday from 7 am - 12 am and Sunday 8 am - 5 pm.
“We are thrilled about this new venture,” said Hardin Center Executive Director Bobby Welch. “We hope to provide a unique coffee house environment where people can feel comfortable and cozy and stay for a while or just run in, get a cup of Starbucks coffee and go. The best thing about this new endeavor is that all proceeds from Cultural Arts Coffee will go to benefit programs at the Hardin Center for Cultural Arts. This is just another way to support the arts in your community.”
