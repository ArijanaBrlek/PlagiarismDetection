Director, Conservation Science Program, Cornell Laboratory of OrnithologyKen Rosenberg
Ken Rosenberg has been at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology since 1993 where he is currently the Director of the Lab's Conservation Science Program. He directs a series of research and citizen science projects focused on conservation related questions, as well as a Neotropical bird conservation initiative, which focuses on conservation assessment, training, and bird monitoring in Mexico and Cuba. He currently oversees the Lab's Ivory-billed Woodpecker search and research efforts, and he is a member of the USFWS Ivory-billed Woodpecker Endangered Species Recovery Team. Ken is also very active in the international bird conservation consortium, Partners in Flight, where he currently is Chair of the PIF science committee. His current work combines analysis of bird population trend and distributional data, development of conservation priorities and recommendations, and working with land managers and planners to implement sound bird conservation strategies. Ken received his Ph.D in Zoology from Louisiana State University - his dissertation focused on foraging specializations in tropical forest birds and how these specializations relate to high tropical bird diversity. He has traveled extensively in North, Central, and South America studying and watching birds.

Rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas in 2004 offered a rare second chance to conserve a species thought to be extinct for over 50 years. This story of hope has been tempered, however, by the daunting challenge of recovering a critically endangered species, and by the controversy surrounding the necessary investment of millions of dollars towards a single species in this time of ever-shrinking conservation resources. The Ivory-bill was a flagship species of the magnificent old-growth bottomland forests that once stretched along southern rivers, but were all-but completely decimated by the mid-20th century. Recovery planning for this endangered bird therefore must focus on restoring its forest habitat and re-creating the old-growth conditions on which it depends. These ambitious goals have been embraced by regional conservation initiatives, whose ongoing efforts to connect forest patches and restore hydrology for the benefit of priority species in many taxonomic groups set the scene for Ivory-billed Woodpecker recovery. Intense focus on this charismatic bird, in turn, has been a boon for regional conservation, with The Nature Conservancy, for example, greatly accelerating its land acquisition and restoration activities in the years immediately following the rediscovery. Unlike the vast majority of endangered species today, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, if it has indeed survived into the 21st century, will face an ever-improving future as bottomland forests mature and re-connect throughout the Southeast.
