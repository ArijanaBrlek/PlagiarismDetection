Charles Russo got a big head start on his bachelors degree in intelligence studies from American Military University. He was able to transfer 40 credits, based on his work for his associates degree and his past military service. His employer at the time helped pay partial tuition and he also used G.I. Bill benefits. This head start is only part of why he chose American Military University, however.Charles Russo, Intelligence Studies Bachelor's Degree
I wasnt looking at tuition costs as much as what the university had to offer, says Russo, who now works for a defense contractor in Northern Virginia. AMU came highly regarded in my field.
AMU also had the program Russo was looking for  one that built on his intelligence and counterterrorism experience. Russo had been an intelligence specialist with the U.S. Navy, serving on active duty from 1990 to 2000. He also served in the U.S. Navy Reserve and was recalled to active duty after 9/11. During this time, he was an intelligence analyst at the National Infrastructure Protection Center. The Center was hosted by the FBI and was a predecessor to the Department of Homeland Security. He served at the Pentagon as part of the Joint Staff in support of Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom.
There werent many schools that had national security programs available, says Russo about his college search in early 2003. AMU was perfect for me. He began his studies in December 2003, taking a full-time course load until he completed his program in August 2007, despite working more than 40 hours a week as a defense contractor. Russo says that he couldnt have done it without the support and motivation he received from family, friends and co-workers. I had to make sure that I followed a schedule for study time and I was determined to finish my degree, he says.
Russo says he began benefiting from his degree program even before graduating. In July 2004, he was selected to be an instructor for the U.S. Navys Basic Reserve Intelligence Training at Andrews Air Force Base. The knowledge I gained through the courses helped me be a better instructor, he says.
His company referenced his experience and studies when meeting with new clients. Russo made sure to get the most out of his studies. He says the professors and the coursework challenged him, but he also challenged himself.
I didnt want to write the easy paper, he says. He also says he took risks on responses he posted on the class online bulletin board. AMU has made me a better intelligence analyst, given me insights and made me a better instructor, says Russo. : : Bristow, Va : U.S. Navy, 1990-2000 (active duty), 2000-Present (U.S. Navy Reserve), Petty Officer First Class : Intelligence Analyst with Battelle Memorial Institute : Graduated in 2008 with bachelors in intelligence studies, terrorism concentration : Continue advancing in his private sector intelligence career
