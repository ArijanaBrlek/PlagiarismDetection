Section: Follow-up
Optimal treatment for your dog requires a combination of home and professional veterinary care. Follow-up is crucial. Administer any medications prescribed by your veterinarian and contact your veterinarian if you are experiencing problems treating your dog. Observe your dog's activity level and appetite. Monitor his skin for bruising and gums for pinpoint hemorrhages. Your dog should be re-examined after 3 to 7 days to evaluate serum biochemical tests and an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) if arrhythmias were detected during hospitalization. The actual follow-up procedure employed will depend on the severity of your dog's heat illness, his response to therapy, and your veterinarian's recommendations.
