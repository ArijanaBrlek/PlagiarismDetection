The counted five architects, one architecture student from Texas A&M university and her mother, two civil engineers from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, four alumni, and enthusiastic students in earth building from all over the map. Interns during preparations were Stevan de la Rosa from Mexico and Scott Rhodes from Austin, Texas; interns for two weeks of building after the workshop were architect Jesus Robles from Arizona and his friend Will McCormick from New Mexico. A 14'x12' adobe brick vaulted roof was completed to shelter a large plastic water tank. An 8ft wide arched doorway permits eventual removal of the tank and on the opposite wall facing south is a 2ft wide entrance. The structure is so beautiful it deserves an appreciative human occupant but for the moment this is our best solution to hide the ugly tank.November 2006 workshop
workshop in Presidio on the art and technique of building a Nubian vaulted roof by hand, was, again, a huge success and attracted lively people of all ages (hardworking 10-year-old to my age) from places like Patagonia, AZ, Iran, Bulgaria, Oregon, students from UT Architecture, Corsica -- all a treat to be with. We have photos in the gallery section!November 4-6, 2005,
Simone presented her work to colleagues from Africa and South America at the University of Santa Clara, Cuba, and at the Centro Universitario Echeverria near Havana. The conferences in Cuba were of immense interest and high quality. The first was on earth building and included Gernot Minke whom I grew to like and admire enormously. Speakers from Ecuador (on preventive seismic damage to foundations of rammed earth buildings), Cuba (community cooperative construction of schools,) Seychelles, Namibia and more were thorough, passionate and provided clear illustrations. The second was in Santa Clara on Eco-Materials. Presenters came from Kenya, Switzerland, Turkey, Argentina, Brasil, Cuba of course, and appeared to me far ahead in research, application and thoroughness from the little I have witnessed here in the US. Both conferences were super-efficiently organized by Paul Moreno of Quito. I have the emails of participants and shall be receiving more information.November 11-15, 2005,

the Adobe Alliance invited adobe builders, daubers and sundry enthusiasts to learn how to mix clay and straw with water, plus highly glutinous prickly pear cactus juice and horse manure  (we now suspect the manure attracts termites) for malleability.

Ms. Jimenez and Simone were invited by Athena and Bill Steen to demonstrate the building of mud roofs made by hand in the configuration of vaults and domes to village women in the Mexican state of Sonora at Xochitl near Obregon. The skill was adopted with real success, the women having an affinity with the material and form rather than with metal roofing.In the spring of 2001
