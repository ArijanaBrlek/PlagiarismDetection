Shabbat at NC Hillel is something special.  It is a warm, welcoming environment. Students gather to socialize and celebrate. We usually have three choices of student-led services to accommodate and encourage various forms of Jewish expression.
 
After services there is always free dinner. We average 100 students at each dinner - with some topping 200!
We are able to provide such a wonderful service due to the generous support of parent and alumni sponsors. $500 sponsors an entire Shabbat dinner - that's less than $5 a student for a joyous Shabbat experience and a delicious family-style meal. You can also co-sponsor a Shabbat Dinner for $250.
