How Does Lortab Work?
Lortab contains two different pain medicines: hydrocodone bitartrate and . Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic narcotic opioid pain reliever. It acts similarly to codeine.

What Is the Potential for Abuse?
Lortab products (as well as other products) are commonly abused drugs. They are readily available and inexpensive, especially in generic form. However, it is important to distinguish between true abuse of the drug and a normal, predictable physical dependence on the drug. Healthcare providers can have difficulty distinguishing behaviors associated with inadequate pain control from drug-seeking behaviors associated with abuse. Because Lortab is a highly desired drug of abuse, people often obtain it through illegal means, such as from foreign countries or online sources that do not require a prescription. People who abuse this medication and suddenly stop using it are likely to experience withdrawal symptoms. hydrocodone/APAP
