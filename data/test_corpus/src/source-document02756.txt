Licence - Scrap Yard & Motor Salvage Operators
Scrap Yards
No person may carry on the business of a scrap metal (recycling of old or damaged metals) dealer unless they are registered to do so by their local authority under the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964.
Registration as a scrap metal dealer lasts for 3 years and must be renewed before the expiry date if the registered person wishes to carry on as a scrap metal dealer.
In addition to registration, the dealer must keep at each registered scrap metal store, a book detailing all scrap metal received at that place and all scrap metal either processed at or dispatched from that place.
Copies of the Scrap Metal Act 1964 can be obtained from Her Majestyâ€™s Stationary Office .
