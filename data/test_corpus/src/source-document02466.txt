 Food combining
"Correctly combining foods makes all the difference in the world to proper digestion, cholesterol and metabolism. Without complete digestion, the nutrients in even the most wholesome food cannot be fully extracted and assimilated by the body.
Moreover, incomplete digestion and inefficient metabolism are the prime causes of fat and cholesterol accumulation in the body.
A low calorie diet of overcooked, processed and improperly combined foods will still make you fat and leave sticky deposits in your arteries, just as the wrong mix of fuels will leave carbon deposits on the spark plugs of an engine, clog the pistons, and create foul gaseous exhaust."
Daniel Reid a living Tao Master reminds us that "the various forms of are primarily the result of toxic impurities clogging blood vessels. This deprives the heart muscles and valves of oxygen and puts excessive chronic strain on the heart, which has to pump much harder than normal to push blood through a clogged circulatory system- a healthy heart pumps about 3,000 gallons of blood every 24 hours, but a heart under the stress of a clogged circulatory system must in 24 hours just to maintain sufficient circulation; obviously, such an 8-fold increase in heart strain soon leads to heart exhaustion and disease. The prime source of the blood impurities and deposits that cause heart disease is a diet composed entirely of denatured and cooked foods."  heart diseasepump up to 25,000 gallons
 
<<TROPHOLOGY - THE SCIENCE OF FOOD COMBINING
"It is an established scientific fact in Western medicine that in order to initiate efficient digestion of any concentrated animal protein, the stomach must secrete pepsin. But it is also a well-known fact that pepsin can function only in a highly acidic medium, which must be maintained for several hours for complete digestion of proteins.
It is an equally well established fact of science that when we chew a piece of bread or potato or any other carbohydrate/starch, ptyalin and other alkaline juices are immediately secreted into the food by the saliva in the mouth. When swallowed, the alkalized starches require an alkaline medium in the stomach in order to complete digestion.
Acid and alkaline juices are secreted simultaneously in response to the incoming protein and starch, promptly neutralizing one another and leaving a weak, watery solution in the stomach that digests neither protein or starch properly. Instead proteins putrefy and starches ferment owing to the constant presence of bacteria in the digestive tract.Anyone should be able to figure out what therefore happens when you ingest protein and starch together.
This putrefaction and fermentation are the primary cause of all sorts of digestive stress, including gas, heartburn, cramps, bloating, constipation, foul stools, bleeding piles, colitis, and so forth.
Many so called 'allergies' are also the direct result of improper food combinations; the bloodstream picks up toxins from the putrefied, fermented mess as it passes slowly through the intestines, and these toxins in turn cause rashes, hives, headaches, nausea and other symptoms commonly branded as allergies. The same foods that cause allergic reactions when improperly combines often have no ill side-effects whatsoever when consumed according to the rules of trophology.
The final fact of the matter is this: when you immobilize your stomach and impair digestive functions by consuming foods in indiscriminate combination, the bacteria in your alimentary canal have a field day. They get all the nutrients and thrive, while you get all the waste and suffer.
According to a recent studies in America, the average American today carries about 5 to 10 pounds of undigested, putrefied red meat in his gut.
Leave 5 pounds of meat in a dark, warm, moist place for a few days and see for yourself the results of putrefaction.
The severely septic condition of the human intestinal tract is unique in nature, yet Western physicians take it for granted and even insist that it is harmless to the rest of the system.
In fact, in order to protect itself from the chronic toxic irritation of improperly combined meals, the colon secretes large quantities of mucus to entrap toxic particles before they damage the colon's sensitive lining. When this occurs at every meal, everyday, every week, throughout the year- as is quite typical in modern Western diets- This results in a narrowing of the passage through the colon and a constant seeping of toxins into the bloodstream by osmosis. When the impacting of toxic mucus in the colon reaches critical pressure, it causes a pocket to balloon outward through the colon lining, causing a condition called diverticulosis. Colitis, IBS, and colon cancer are the next stages of colon deterioration caused by these conditions." the colon ends up secreting a constant stream of mucus, which accumulates and gets impacted in the folds of the colon.

There is NO SUCH THING as a cleansing diet or detox diet...
Eating better is always...better, but without proper cleansing first you're looking at years to reach a similar level of improvement, if it can be done at all. I doubt many would have the patience for it. And cleansing itself should become a year-in-year-out kind of activity too, and no amount of proper dieting alone can come close to it.
Flawless good health cannot be achieved by adjustments. You have to fundamentally create it, re-engineer it from inside out...
Just trying to improve your diet isn't enough these days. It's an important step, but still not enough.The world we live in and the foods we eat are just too toxic for just that to be enough.
It's a quantitative question that we asked our cleansers to reply to in a New Years poll. See who were active at the forum that week said happened for them.How many health issues can disappear forever after HPS guided cleansing? We did a poll and asked cleansers this question in 2006.

Pretending to colon cleanse is cute (i.e., just taking some supplements), but that doesn't get the job done. Changing your diet is nice too (i.e., adding a few things, removing a few things) but that too unfortunately doesn't get the job done either.
No pretending.
You are led step-by-step through all the various stages of cleansing and renewal. It's one thing to read about it in a book. Another to actually do it with continuous guidance and a comprehensive support system that you can bank on.
No guessing.
We've been guiding newbie's, newcomers to rejuvenation, for over a decade now... over 3,000 cleanses served to date. You are not going to find a more proven, tested and tried health program anywhere at any price, online or off.
No ambiguity.
