flew by Uranus on January 24, 1986, coming within 81,500 kilometers (50,600 miles) of the planet's cloud tops. The spacecraft took almost 8,000 images of the planet, its moons and its dark ring system. Voyager 2

This view of Uranus was recorded by Voyager 2 on January 25, l986, as the spacecraft left the planet behind and set forth on the cruise to Neptune. Voyager was 1 million kilometers (about 600,000 miles) from Uranus when it acquired this wide-angle view. The picture -- a color composite of blue, green and orange frames -- has a resolution of 140 kilometers (90 miles) per pixel.

These two pictures of Uranus -- one in true color (left) and the other in false color (right) -- were compiled from images returned January 17, 1986, by the narrow-angle camera of Voyager 2. The spacecraft was 9.1 million kilometers (5.7 million miles) from the planet, several days from closest approach. The picture at left has been processed to show Uranus as human eyes would see it from the vantage point of the spacecraft. The picture at right uses false color and extreme contrast enhancement to bring out subtle details in the polar region of Uranus.

These time-lapse Voyager 2 images of Uranus show the movement of two small, bright, streaky clouds, the first such features ever seen on the planet. The clouds were detected in this series of images taken on January 14, 1986, over a 4.6-hour interval (from top to bottom). At the time, the spacecraft was about 12.9 million kilometers (8 million miles) from the planet, whose pole of rotation is near the center of each disk. Uranus, which is tipped on its side with respect to the other planets, is rotating in a counterclockwise direction, as are the two clouds seen here.

This false-color Voyager picture of Uranus shows a discrete cloud seen as a bright streak near the planet's limb. The picture is a highly processed composite of three images obtained January 14, 1986, when the spacecraft was 12.9 million kilometers (8 million miles) from the planet. The cloud visible here is the most prominent feature seen in a series of Voyager images designed to track atmospheric motions. (The occasional donut- shaped features, including one at the bottom, are shadows cast by dust in the camera optics.)

As Voyager 2 exited the Uranian system it looked back and caught the rings at a very high phase angle. Voyager took this image while in the shadow of Uranus, at a distance of 236,000 kilometers (142,000 miles) and a resolution of about 33 kilometers (20 miles) per pixel. The lighting makes lanes of fine dust visible that are not seen from any other point of view. The image is smeared because it is a 96-second exposure. Faint streaks are background stars.

Voyager 2 approached closer to Miranda than to any other of Uranus' satellites. In this view the striped terrain of Inverness Corona juts into lumpy, more cratered terrain. Jagged mountains march off to Miranda's limb.
