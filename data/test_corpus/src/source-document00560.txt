Technology Transfer
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's world-class research often results in patented intellectual property. We strive to understand the business opportunities for new inventions so that they can become a useful product or service. An excellent example of successful technology transfer is the life-saving deployment of our millimeter wave technology that is licensed for personnel security screening applications. The systems are used to screen for concealed weapons or explosives. The same basic technology is also licensed into the apparel industry in applications for custom fitting clothing for consumers.
