A Bounty or Amnesty for Osama?
By RUSS WELLEN
Does the US State Department's renewed campaign to publicize its $25 million (soon to be doubled) bounty represent an honest attempt to capture Osama bin Laden? It worked with Saddam Hussein's sons, the argument goes, on whom there was a bounty of $15 million each. However, they were turned over with the expectation the US would prevail in Iraq.
Illinois Republican House member Mark Kirk, who wrote the bill for the publicity campaign, said, "We're looking for some young Pashtun. . . [who] can figure out how to reach us safely."1 Allah be with you, young Pashtun. First, dial (92) 51-208-00000 for the American consulate in Islamabad and ask for Crock, as US ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Crocker will no doubt ask you to call him. Keep in mind, however, that you might find yourself negotiating away much of the bounty in exchange for protective custody for yourself, your family, and members of your clan. (It would be instructive to learn what has become of the Husseins, informant and his people.) Furthermore, by the time such complex negotiations are completed, bin Laden is likely to have been re-safe-housed and the contract you were hammering out will be rendered null and void.
Perhaps, however, in keeping with US policy of using American contractors, that kind of money is actually intended to lure American mercenaries or bounty hunters. The story of Jonathan Idema suggests otherwise. Despite supplying the US military with what he described as a Taliban intelligence chief, he was arrested for imprisoning terror suspects on his own. Idema's conviction and sentencing to an Afghani jail term is sure to give pause to even the most grandiose soldier of fortune.
But from where do intelligence officials in Kabul and Islamabad summon the gall to claim there has been no trace of bin Laden for the past twenty months?1 Everyone knows Pakistan's ISI and Al Qaida wallow together in a sty of co-dependency.2 One can't help but wonder if the bounty's primary function is to demonstrate not the sincerity, but the appearance, of an intention to apprehend bin Laden.
If we really wanted bin Laden would we subject ourselves to regular lectures by a mass murderer? "No doubt you recall the words of the conceited one," he scolds, "who said I will settle the battle in six days or seven weeks... [that the] whole thing is a picnic in Panama."3 Whether as a terror kingpin or in his new role as a foreign affairs analyst for OBL-TV, bin Laden haunts us. Maybe that's because instead of trying to collar him like a criminal, however uncommon, we've fallen into the trap of trying to exorcise him as if he were a demon.
In response to 9/11, waves of shock and anger rippled forth from the Bos-Wash corridor. Then, three months later, ripping the bandage off still suppurating wounds, bin Laden issued the audiotape in which he took responsibility for 9/11. A World Trade Center survivor, Mark Finelli, claimed the tape made him feel "violent and enraged. . . . I just wanted to punch the screen." Indianapolis firefighter Matt Hahn said, "What we're all looking for now is a swift, stern, exact punishment."4 In an article on Newsweek Web Exclusive, another WTC survivor, Eileen Touhey-Kiniery, no doubt spoke for many when she said, "I don't have the words to describe this maniacal coward, this living subhuman organism."5
The response of one man who,d lost a daughter, however, was a portent. "It should be filed away and let the government and the CIA take care of it," he said.4 Meanwhile, immediately after 9/11, in Washingtonville, New York, a town that lost five firefighters, an open grave was dug and a huge headstone engraved with bin Laden's name was erected.6 Within a week, however, the headstone was replaced by the figure of a white eagle surrounded by yellow chrysanthemums. Then, a few months later, a poll revealed that we were willing to risk large numbers of casualties among US troops in order to capture or kill bin Laden.7 However, as was beginning to become apparent, while this may have been a call for retaliation, it was also a plea to the government to take over and relieve us of the need to sustain messy feelings of revenge.
Instead many became preoccupied with healing. Tibetan Buddhist Gehlek Rinpoche said, "Your hatred, my hatred are our own Osama bin Laden. Your, my Osama Bin Laden is hiding behind the mountains of our hearts."8 However profound, coming just nine days after 9/11, he seemed like a waiter rushing us through dinner. We needed time to digest the anger.
At the other extreme was "Why We Should Love Osama Bin Laden," in which Kevin Williams, who maintains near-death.com, an otherwise estimable clearinghouse for near-death experiences, tells us: "Although I believe that Bin Laden should be captured and imprisoned, I believe that we should love the man as we should love everyone -- unconditionally. . . . [the] terrorist attacks are really a cry out for help and it is our obligation
