Although its significance has long since faded from public memory, November 25th was once widely celebrated in New York City as Evacuation Day. In 1783, it marked the departure of the last British troops from American soil and George Washington's victorious return to the city that had been occupied since 1776. One of the most notable aspects of the British withdrawal and Washingtonâ€™s subsequent march through New York City was the relative orderliness that characterized the events.
Enthusiasm for celebrating Evacuation Day waxed and waned in the following decades, peaking with the centennial anniversary in 1883. The celebration, said to be "one of the great civic events of the nineteenth century in New York City", included a parade, fireworks, and the unveiling of a statue of Washington. The New York Times reported that "the dinner of the Chamber of Commerce ended the last of the centennial days".
