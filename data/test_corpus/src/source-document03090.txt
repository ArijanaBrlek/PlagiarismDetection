ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES
Nanoscience Awards
Annual Awards Starting Summer 2002. Application deadline is 5 p.m. Monday, May 6. Information and Applications available at: http://www.nano.washington.edu/education/jin.asp
The PNNL/UW Joint Institute in Nanoscience provides a variety of ways to encourage collaborative research involving the two institutions. The awards described below require application by an interested student, faculty member, or combined UW-PNNL project team. In addition to the opportunities described below, PNNL/UW research teams may propose activities as part of the PNNL Laboratory Directed Research and Development proposal process that usually takes place in the spring.
student applicants must have completed nine months of graduate school at UW by the start of the award period. Other applicants must be members of the graduate faculty at UW. Renewal applications will be ranked together with new applications. Renewal applicants must submit a progress report together with a proposal (see details below).Eligibility:
Award Categories:
Joint Institute Graduate Fellowships These can be of two types
Joint Institute Graduate Fellowship for Thesis Research Thesis research activity for UW graduate students involving collaborations between UW and PNNLp to a three year period, any time at the start or later in the student career. (A student will normally propose these awards with project team support.)
Joint Institute Graduate Fellowship for Advanced Training Research quarter(s) for UW graduate students at PNNL, not necessarily applied directly to thesis work, but designed to optimize the student learning of advanced research techniques. Some of these fellowships may involve pprenticeparticipation on a PNNL project during this learning period or working with Users in the EMSL. Could possibly serve as a ab rotationfor degrees, which require them (such as the anotechnology PhD Option. (Proposed by student only.) JIN Graduate Fellowships for Advanced Training for a single quarter duration (non-renewable) can also be made at other times by submitting an informal request / justification / budget explanation letter to one of the JIN Co-Directors
Joint Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship Full or partial salary support for postdoc for research activity in a collaboration involving both UW and PNNL. (Proposed by a team of collaborators from both UW and PNNL, with potential postdoc candidate(s) identified, when known in advance, and appointment period specified.)
Joint Institute Faculty Appointments Full or partial funding for faculty salary during summer or other quarter research visits to PNNL, or for time spent at either PNNL or UW which is clearly PNNL/UW collaborative research or proposal writing, designed to benefit both PNNL and UW. (Proposed by UW faculty and collaborator(s) from PNNL). Small Faculty salary requests (1 or 2 week) can also be made at other times by submitting an informal request / justification / budget explanation letter to one of the JIN Co-Directors
Joint Institute Travel Grant Funding of travel to and partial support for housing/living expenses at the partner institution for those involved in joint UW/PNNL collaborations, or for other travel essential to the success of the collaborative research goals.. (Proposed by anyone or group applying for any one of the above award types, or by those whose salary is already paid but for whom travel expenses for the collaboration are not readily covered.) Smaller travel awards can be requested at any time with an informal request / justification / budget explanation letter to one of the JIN Co-Directors.
Selection criteria will be as follows, in order of decreasing importance:
1. Quality of proposed research.
2. Expected enhancement of collaborations between PNNL and UW. The PNNL Nanoscience and Technology Initiative has identified focus areas in oxide nanostructures, soft materials interfaces, nanobiology, and computation. Projects linking these focus areas to subjects of importance to DOE Missions involving environmental, energy, fundamental science or national security topics are most useful. To some extent, this expectation of enhancement will depend on the estimated productivity of the individuals and teamwork involved.
3. Relevance to nanoscience.
4. Expected contribution toward opportunities for external funding of collaboration between PNNL and UW, and /or impact on other Joint Institute missions besides that in item 2 above (e.g., quick publications, etc.).
5. Previous academic and/or or research performance of individual to be funded and/or collaborators from PNNL and UW (new proposals only).
6. Performance in first funded period (renewals ONLY).
