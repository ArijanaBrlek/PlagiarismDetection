Modernized recipe from edited by C. Anne Wilson, chapter 4, by Peter Brears.(Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 1986, ISBN 0 7486 0103 1)'Banquetting Stuffe'Rare Conceits and Strange Delightes
 
8 oz (225 g) (when prepared) peeled and stoned apricots
3 oz (75 g) sugar (Alys: 1/2 cup; 1 lb. apricots to 1/3 lb. sugar)
 
Place the apricots in a heatproof jar, seal the top with a piece of cooking foil, and stand in a covered saucepan of boiling water for an hour.Pour the apricots into a small saucepan and gently boil, stirring continuously until the paste is extremely thick; then add the sugar and continue stirring.When it is so thick that it has to be spread across the bottom of the pan with a spoon, it may be turned on to a lightly greased plate, worked into a shallow square block, and allowed to cool.It has a deep orange colour, and is every bit as good today as Sir Kenelm found it three centuries ago.
 
Alys's revision:(1 lb. apricots to 1/3 lb. sugar. Ten apricots (2-2 1/2") are slightly under one pound when peeled and stoned.)
 
Slice the apricots, place in cooking container (Corningware 1 3/4 quart pan holds a little over 2 lbs. of apricots).Seal with foil and rubber band for extra security.Place in large pot, or larger Corningware container.If you put a lid on the outer container you needn't top it off with boiling water as quickly.Add boiling water and set on burner at simmer for a good two hours.The apricots should have fallen into a mush by then.
 
To peel apricots easily, place them in boiling water for about two minutes and then remove them.The skins should peel off easily with a knife or your fingers.If you let them stay in the boiling water too long they begin to cook and get mushy under the skin.You can also just slice the apricots without peeling them.After they have cooked for two or more hours, puree them in a blender.It is best to use a thick pan for cooking the pureed apricots and sugar.If you simmer them on a low heat you need not stir them continuously until the mixture begins to thicken and erupt into "burps."This "cooking down" process can take 4 hours or so depending on the amount of apricots you use and the temperature of the heat.You will need to stir the mixture more and more as it gets thicker.The apricots are done when you can drag your spoon through the mixture and it leaves a trail.It should also be pulling away from the sides of the pan at this time.
 
While this recipe doesn't call for a sugar syrup, you can make one by taking an amount of sugar, wetting it enough to dissolve the sugar, and heating it to hard crack stage.Add it to the apricots, stirring as you add it.Then cook the mixture down over low heat until you can make a trail with your spoon.Pour into shallow, buttered pans and allow to cool.You can cut them into squares or into shapes using small cookie or canapcutters.Store between waxed paper or parchment paper. With proper storage they will keep for a year or so.
