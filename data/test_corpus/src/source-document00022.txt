Weight Loss and Exercise Basics
People who are not so happy with their shape and size normally lose weight through exercise and a balanced diet. These are the two important factors which help in fat loss and reduction in weight. Weight loss is all about on how to reduce body fat and achieve proper shape. In our body, calories are stored as body fat. To be in shape one needs to reduce the calorie intake. Another option is to increase the daily activity tasks. There should be a proper balance between the calories you eat and the calories you burn out. Cardiovascular exercises are very important for fat burning. This type of exercise mainly relies on oxygen which produces energy in our body. It is always advised to do high intensity aerobic exercise than a normal low intensity workout. Jogging helps in burning more calories and is far more effective than walking at the same distance. Green tea helps to increase the free fatty acids which are required to burn fat. Taking green tea before going for a jog can also help. Have a healthy and balanced diet. A balanced diet mainly includes fruits, vegetables, bread, cereals and potatoes, and less fatty and sugary foods. The diet should include Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of nutrients. Everyone should follow a Food Pyramid which will show the kind of food one should take on a daily basis. Eating More Often is another good habit as it produces required energy and also increases the metabolism which further burns the calories more quickly. Always try to have regular small meals. 1. Avoid starving yourself. Food acts as a fuel or energy in our body and when we skip our meals we dont get that required energy. 2. Never skip your breakfast 3. Try to eat complex carbohydrates. They are normally found in potatoes, pastas, whole grains, beans, vegetables and fruits. They contain calories which can be easily burned. Avoid taking simple carbohydrates like cereal, soft drinks, candy and ice cream. 4. Eat Fibrous food like citrus fruits, broccoli, beans, barley and oat bran. 5. Drink more water. Water is required to process waste and also helps the body to breakdown the fat. 6. Do regular exercise and be active. Building muscle is also effective. 7. Follow the Food Pyramid.
