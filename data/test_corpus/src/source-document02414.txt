In Oriental myth, the dragon could not be more opposite to its Western counterpart. Dragons in Oriental art do not have WINGS nor do they necessarily breathe fire, although FLAMES erupt from their limbs. They are not creatures of EARTH, but rather combine elements of the air and WATER and are equally at home in the OCEAN or the CLOUDS. Al- though strength and power are represented, the dragon above all is a reconciliation of opposites, a combination of YIN AND YANG. Also unlike the Western dragon, the Oriental dragon is not a cunningly malevolent beast. Instead it is strength combined with wisdom and is benevolent. It is also not unusual to see a dragon clutching a BALL. a PEARL, or a jewel in one of its claws. This item is essentially the closed-lotus form seen in various Buddhist designs including those in temples and on grave markers. It represents the spiritual essence of the universe, by which the dragon controls the winds, rains, and even the movement of the planets, and he protects it from those who might usurp those powers. Like other Japanese tattoos, the choice of a dragon is an aspiration to these same qualities of wholeness and wisdom. It is one of the more popular of Japanese-style tattoos and they are depicted with great variety in terms of body position, degree of hostility in aggressive or passive position of the claws and jaws, and in their environment.
