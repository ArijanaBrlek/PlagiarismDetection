Your report and the total tax due must be postmarked or received by DMV by the deadline. If your report is late or you do not submit the total tax due, you will be subject to a late fee of $50 or 10% of the tax due, whichever is greater, plus interest of 1% per month for each month late.What is the penalty if I do not file my tax reports on time?
Taxable miles are the sum total of the miles you traveled in any jurisdiction that are taxable. If a jurisdiction allows any exemptions and you qualify, you may deduct the miles you operated under that exemption from your taxable miles. Example: Ohio exempts all two-axle trucks operated without a trailer and two-axle trucks operated with a trailer weighing under 3,000 pounds empty. If any of your operations in Ohio meet this criteria, you may deduct those miles from your taxable miles in Ohio. If you operated under a temporary fuel trip permit, you may deduct the miles you operated under the permit in each jurisdiction from the taxable miles for that jurisdiction.What are taxable miles?
Road tax revenues are used to support construction, reconstruction or maintenance of the roads. The philosophy behind a surcharge is that heavier vehicles cause more damage to the highways; therefore, the taxes paid for those vehicles should be higher than the taxes paid for smaller vehicles.Why does Virginia have a surcharge tax?
Virginia road use tax rate is 21 cents per gallon of fuel. This means that for every gallon of fuel used to travel on Virginia highways in heavy vehicles, a tax of 21 cents per gallon is charged. When you purchase fuel in Virginia only 17.5 cents of the 21 cents tax is collected at the time of purchase; the remaining 3.5 cents of the tax due on each gallon of fuel used is collected when you file your motor fuel road tax report. The 3.5 cents tax is called a surcharge. There are other jurisdictions that also have a surcharge.
