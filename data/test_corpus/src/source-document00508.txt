Diagnostic tests
Being told you have heart disease may be as confusing as it is upsetting. It often means different things to different people. Descriptions of some of the more common conditions follow.
As we age, our once-elastic arteries may lose some of their ability to expand, and fatty layers made up of fats, cholesterol and other materials may built up along the arteries' walls restricting blood flow. This hardening and narrowing process is called , and when it affects the coronary arteries, it is called coronary artery disease. Coronary arteries are vulnerable to atherosclerosis because they are small, slightly larger than an average strand of spaghetti. When a coronary artery narrows more than 50 percent, it is considered serious enough for the person to be diagnosed as having coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death among Americans.

Symptoms of coronary artery disease may vary from chest pain or discomfort (angina) to a heart attack to sudden cardiac death.

When the oxygen supply to the heart muscle is impeded, chest discomfort or pain results. Angina, the medical term for this pain, may occur when you exercise, experience a strong emotion or it may even occur at rest. Angina that is not relieved after resting 15 minutes or after taking up to three nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue five minutes apart may be a sign of a . Angina pectoris

Arrhythmias are irregularities in your heartbeat (pulse) caused by disturbances in the electrical system controlling the heart. Arrhythmias often cause no problems and may result from nothing more serious than too much caffeine or not enough sleep. They can be serious when associated with cardiovascular disease. Several types of heart disease, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and valve disease are associated with atrial fibrillation, which occurs when the heart's two upper chambers beat very rapidly. It can usually be well controlled with medications such as digitalis or beta blockers. Electrical disturbances of the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, are more serious. Ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (when the ventricle beats rapidly) and ventricular fibrillation (when the ventricle barely pumps at all) may be life-threatening. Bradyarrhythmia, or slow heart rate, may be caused by aging, damage to the heart, certain medications or a heart block. A heart block may be caused by a scar in the tissues that conduct electrical impulses. Arrhythmias

The human heart forms between the eighth and tenth week of gestation. Any congenital disease develops during this time. Valve defects and holes in the inner separating walls of the heart are forms of congenital heart disease. For example, an atrial septal defect is an opening in the wall separating the two upper chambers of the heart, which causes blood to flow abnormally, from the left to the right side of the heart. It is usually repaired surgically. A ventricular septal defect occurs between the two lower chambers of the heart. Although congenital heart disease has historically been a pediatric problem, advances in diagnostic modalities, medical management and catheter-based and surgical intervention have revealed the condition in adults to such a degree that it equals the number of pediatric patients born with the most common congenital disease. Adults and adolescents with congenital heart disease are treated through the , a joint program of Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine. Congenital heart disease

A diagnosis of congestive heart failure is made when one experiences symptoms caused by the heart's inability to pump blood forward on demand. Blood begins to back up, and pressure within the heart rises. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling, fatigue and decreased tolerance for exercise. Heart muscle disease, a history of heart attacks, high blood pressure, and cardiac valve problems are the major causes of CHF.(CHF) Congestive heart failure

There are several kinds of heart muscle disease that enlarge heart chambers and cause weakening of the heart. These include pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the heart; myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle; and endocarditis, an infection of a heart valve or the inner lining of the heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy is a general term doctors often use to describe diseases of heart muscle. Heart muscle disease

The force with which the heart pushes blood through the body is called "blood pressure." If blood vessels are narrowed because of atherosclerosis or other causes, the heart must pump harder than normal to circulate blood resulting in high blood pressure or hypertension. Eventually if hypertension is not well managed, the heart chambers may become enlarged and the heart muscle may thicken. The heart needs more oxygen to function, and its efficiency decreases. After many years of hypertension, heart failure may occur. For more information about lowering high blood pressure, visit the . High blood pressure

Diseases of the heart's four valves--the tricuspid and pulmonary on the right side of the heart and the aortic and mitral valves on the left--occur when the valve narrows or fails to close properly. When blood passes through a narrowed or leaky valve, the resulting noise is a heart murmur. Valvular heart disease
