 
Fighting infant and maternal malnutrition
In order to support the Ministry of Public Health, local governments and other institutions involved in nutritional education, UNICEF provides them with educational materials about eating and nutrition.These materials emphasize the consumption of iodized salt, which is fundamental for the prevention of goiter and cretinism. It also promotes the use of iron supplements during pregnancy and the first years of life, as well as the administration of vitamin A to children between six months and three years in public health services, when they receive vaccines.Until 2004 UNICEF supplied iron supplements and vitamin A; since 2005 they have been in the budget of the Ministry of Health.  
UNICEF also offers technical support to State institutions to generate information about chronic malnutrition rates in children and adolescents.Thanks to UNICEF, the 2004 National Inquiry on Life Conditions included indicators on small stature, a consequence of malnutrition affecting close to 350,000 children under five.
