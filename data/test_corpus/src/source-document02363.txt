is a humble grassroots initiative that aims to build a peaceful, nonviolent and just world. We are a project of the Spirit in Life Movement, a registered Public Charitable and Educational Trust. Buddha Smiles is inspired by the Gandhian philosophy of Sarvodaya (welfare of all) which recognizes that the spiritual, moral, cultural, social, economic and political dimensions are all necessary components of holistic development. Our primary objective is to address the challenges of primary education for disadvantaged children at the grassroots level by creating community-based schools. We do this in cooperation with students, social activists and enthusiastic community members. The education of women has a much greater influence and impact on child care and development than any form of social action, therefore we incorportate basic health care for woman into our educational programs.
