My mom didn't want my younger brother to make a MySpace for fear of Child molesters, but finally she decided to let him make one. That same day she made him take it off because a man named "Tom" had hacked into his account and added himself as a friend. She made me e-mail MySpace to let them know of a possible child molester.

Do your parents not understand technology? Do they ask you stupidquestions? Do they send you absurd text messages? Do they use wordslike "MyFace,""SpaceBook,"or "The World Wide Web?"
If you've got an example of your Parents Just Don't Understanding, submit it here !
And thank God we'll never be as dumb as they are!
Your parents' 2009.
