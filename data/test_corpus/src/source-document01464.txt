Hi, my name is Keith Stephens for About.com Garden. Today I'm going to show you how to use a post hole digger to dig a hole. A post hole digger is designed specifically for digging holes to put posts in. For fences, mailboxes - you get the idea. Let's get started. A couple of things you will need: To start, hold one handle in each hand, with both shovel blades facing down. Bring the handles together, then jam the two shovel blades into the ground. Pull the handles apart, and lift the chunk of dirt up and into a convenient pile beside the hole. Repeat as necessary. Now, after a few hours of digging holes, your whole body will feel like you just spent a few hours digging holes. I'm going to show you a technique that will help keep you from jarring your skeletal frame. It's usually known as spearchucking, since you are going to treat the handles of the post hole diggers as if they were spears. Get a nice good grip on the handles. Raise the handles up, then quickly and forcefully, bring the post hole digger down. Just before impact, let go of the handles. If you didn't let go soon enough, the impact of the blades with the ground and your death grip on the handles will send a tingly impact up your hands and into your wrists, elbows, shoulders, and neck. Please believe me when i tell you that this hurts. Spend an entire day digging post holes with a death grip on the handles, and your upper body will feel like jelly. Thanks for watching.
