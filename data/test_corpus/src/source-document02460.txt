Motor Vehicle Policy
Motor Vehicle Policy
The following rules and procedures are established for all students and their guests in order to provide for the orderly and safe operation of vehicles on campus.  All motor vehicles must be registered with the Office of Campus Safety. Campus parking is a privilege and students are expected to abide by the parking regulations.  Parking privileges may be revoked at any time. The college assumes no responsibility or liability for the care or protection of any vehicle or its contents while operated or parked on college property.
REGISTRATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES
Registration for student vehicles is held in the Colket Center during student check-in at the beginning of each semester and also prior to fall semester through “Early Bird” mail-in registration.  After that time it is the student's responsibility to register his/her vehicle at the Office of Campus Safety located in Bowman Hall.  Information needed for vehicle registration includes:  make, model, color, year of vehicle, license plate number. The social security number of the student and a local address is also required.
Registration Requirements
A student must be enrolled for the current academic session at Roanoke College.
The vehicle must comply with all state and local licensing and registration requirement of the owner’s state and locality of residence.
All vehicles must be covered by liability insurance consistent with the minimum requirements of the State of Virginia.
The student must have a valid operator's license from their state of residence and not have had driving privileges revoked in any state.
The student’s motor vehicle privileges must not be in a revoked status by the college.
There is an annual, non-refundable parking fee of $35 for each student utilizing college parking facilities. The fee must be paid at the time the student's vehicle is registered with the Office of Campus Safety. A parking decal will be issued after payment of the parking fee. Decals are valid from September through August of each year. There is no parking fee for students with vehicles on campus while attending the May Intensive Learning or Summer School sessions; however, vehicles must be registered and display a parking decal. Payment of the annual parking fee does not guarantee a parking space in a particular lot.  Sufficient parking space is usually available when all student lots on campus are utilized. Parking lots are for the use of students during the terms in which they are enrolled.  They are not intended to be used for long term parking between terms such as during the summer, or for long-term storage of disabled vehicles. Vehicles must be moved within 5 days after the end of the term. Use of campus parking lots for long term storage of disabled or surplus vehicles is not permitted. If a matriculating student wishes to leave his or her vehicle in a parking lot during breaks between college terms, notification must be made to and permission granted by the Office of Campus Safety. Otherwise vehicles must be moved within 5 days after the end of the term. Up to two decals can be obtained for additional vehicles used, owned, and registered by a student. For additional decals, proof of ownership (State Registration Card) of the vehicle must be presented and will be required before the decal is issued. Additional decals are $5 each. The student registering the vehicle(s) is held responsible for the decal(s) until the date of expiration or the date the Office of Campus Safety is notified of the loss or destruction of the decal.  Students are subject to disciplinary action and/or loss of parking privileges for obtaining or attempting to obtain a decal under false pretenses. The Roanoke College parking decal must be removed from your vehicle upon graduation, leaving college, trade of vehicles, or any change in vehicle status.Parking Fee and Decals
PARKING DECALS MUST BE PLACED IN A VISIBLE POSITION ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE VEHICLE’S REAR BUMPER, LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE REAR OUTSIDE WINDOW, OR SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE LEFTHAND INSIDE REAR GLASS OF THE VEHICLE.
Guests of the campus community who need to park a vehicle on campus may obtain a guest permit through the Office of Campus Safety.  Temporary permits are issued for valid reasons such as borrowed or rented cars.  Guest and temporary permits are issued for specific periods of time at no charge and are under the same rules and regulations as permanent registrations. Hosts are responsible to see that guests are familiar with and abide by campus parking regulations.  Guests and Temporary Permits
