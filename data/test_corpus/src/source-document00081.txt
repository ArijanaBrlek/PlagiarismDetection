Fox sisters
Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848, as the beginning of their movement. On that date, , of , reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Kate and Margaret Fox Hydesville, New York [1] [2]

In the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship ( and , for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead. Showmanship became an increasingly important part of Spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences.

A particularly important convert was the French pedagogist (1804-1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of , which became widespread in Latin countries. In , Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today. In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually gave birth to a movement known as (White Table).

A number of spiritualist periodicals appeared in the nineteenth century, and these did much to hold the movement together. Among the most important were the weeklies (Boston), (Chicago), (Philadelphia), (London), and (London). Other influential periodicals were the (France), (Belgium), (Italy), (Spain), and (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly spiritualist periodicals published around the world. These periodicals differed a great deal from each other, reflecting the great differences among Spiritualists. Some, such as the British were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within Spiritualism. Others, such as , were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as , attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.The Banner of LightThe Religio-Philosophical JournalMind and MatterThe SpiritualistThe MediumRevue SpiriteLe MessagerAnnali dello SpiritismoEl Criterio EspiritistaThe Harbinger of Light [18] Spiritual MagazineHuman NatureThe Spiritualist [19]
