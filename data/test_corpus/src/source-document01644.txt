** Matching your solar panels to your batteries: We sell a lot of solar panels that are intended for grid tie or other larger systems. Many of those are not the correct voltage for charging batteries with a standard charge controller. In many cases you will need to use one of the MPPT controllers to match the voltages up. **

Mounts for Solar Electric Panels
We only list a small portion of all the PV panel mounts available here. There are thousands of configurations and variations for most - call or email us for any specific type of mount not listed here. Shipping times vary considerably on mounts - Top of Pole and other pre-welded usually take longer than rail mounts. IronRidge normally ships in 2 to 5 days, RV mounts usually ship next day, UniRac mounts may take from 5 to 15 days. Large racks, trackers, & pole mounts will usually take from 2 to 6 weeks. Bottom line is, only a few (such as some IronRidge and most RV mounts) will ship right away - expect to wait as long as 3 to 8 weeks on most large mounts, as they are built to order. Rail type mounts (IronRidge, Direct Power, Conergy SunTop, and UniRac) usually ship in 3 to 7 days. There are far too many types and styles of mounts for anyone to stock or list the full range, and the list changes constantly as new panels come out or old ones discontinued. We carry all types and sizes of solar panel mounts by the major manufacturers - IronRidge, Zomeworks, Direct Power, Wattsun trackers, Conergy SunTop, and UniRac. Most IronRidge, Unirac rail mounts, and Direct Power rail systems can all be shipped by UPS, but some long rails are expensive by UPS. Most larger pre-assembled mounts must be shipped by freight, and can be very heavy. Most larger mounts will be drop shipped directly from the manufacturer to save on shipping costs.
** Note on solar panel mounts and ordering mounts:
Keeping up with all the different types of solar panel mounts is a nightmare for anyone, including us, so you may want to call or email us for specific applications, especially for any of the older panels that are not listed.
