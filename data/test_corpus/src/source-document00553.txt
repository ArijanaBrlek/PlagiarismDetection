About Us
It's true. Gone are the days of driving out of town to find quality physical therapy. Now all the things that you want most in a physical therapy practice can be found right here at Brandon Rehabilitation. You want qualified physical therapists who use the latest technology and effective techniques to get you out of pain fast. Physical therapists who not only have outstanding educations and strong credentials, but who volunteer their time and services at the local high school. Yet you also want physical therapists who take the time to get to know you and believe in highly personalized care. Physical therapists who know your name and talk to you more like a friend. Physical therapists who still know the meaning of Southern hospitality. Physical therapists like the ones at Brandon Rehabilitation.
