Radio Connection is a SCHOOL ALTERNATIVE.  It is not like the one you are used to. With Radio Connection, your CLASSROOM is in a real RADIO STATION. Unlike traditional schools you DO NOT have to compete for learning time and one on one attention with 20-40 other students. With Radio Connection you learn one-on-one. Just you and your teacher. With Radio Connection you take a STRUCTURED COURSE. Your course is given to you one-on-one by a real radio professional who adds his years and years of experience to our industry sponsored, accredited course curriculum. The Radio Connection is accredited by the National Private School Accreditation Alliance (NPSAA). The Radio Connection has been privately owned and operated for 25 years. We are still owned and operated by the same executive staff as when we started in 1983. The Radio Connection does not wait till after you graduate from our program to help you find paid work. From Day One after you sign up, we assign to you a Student Services Representative. This person calls you  every 2-3 weeks and helps you to find paid work and quality internships in your area. That's right, you not only get a private mentor, you also get your own personal student services representative, working with you to help you become employable in the real world. The Radio Connection will help you to find work up to one year after you graduate, for NO additional tuition charges. The Radio Connection is a perfect compliment to your day job or regular school. We will do our best to work around your busy schedule.  We will find you a real, on-air radio station where you live for your "classroom." Once you graduate, you will be certified by the The Radio Connection. This certification along with your 6 months of in-studio experience will make you eligible to work as an assistant engineer and on air talent or voiceover in more than 5,000 real Radio studios nationwide. We want you and your family to feel comfortable when working with us at The Radio Connection Audio School Alternative. For this reason we have made the Vice President and the President of our school available to you and your family.   AFTER YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH AN ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR AND IF YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED for PLACEMENT, if you or your family should have any additional questions about our program, please feel free to call us at and ask to speak to the office of The Vice President. You will be asked to leave a message. Please leave your name and number and we will get back to you within 48 hours.
