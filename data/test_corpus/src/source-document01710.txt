What is a joint?
Joints are the areas where two bones meet. Most joints are mobile, allowing the bones to move. Joints consist of the following:
cartilage-at the joint, the bones are covered with cartilage (a connective tissue), which is made up of cells and fibers and is wear-resistant. Cartilage helps reduce the friction of movement.
synovial membrane-a tissue called the synovial membrane lines the joint and seals it into a joint capsule. The synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid (a clear, sticky fluid) around the joint to lubricate it.
ligaments-strong ligaments (tough, elastic bands of connective tissue) surround the joint to give support and limit the joint's movement.
tendons-tendons (another type of tough connective tissue) on each side of a joint attach to muscles that control movement of the joint.
bursas-fluid-filled sacs, called bursas, between bones, ligaments, or other adjacent structures help cushion the friction in a joint.
synovial fluid-a clear, sticky fluid secreted by the synovial membrane.
femur-the thigh bone.
