About the Job & Career ConneCTion
Welcome to the Connecticut Job & Career ConneCTion, a product of the Connecticut Department of Labor's Office of Research. We believe you will find the Job & Career ConneCTion to be the most comprehensive source of information on jobs and careers available in Connecticut.
The Job & Career ConneCTion is intended for use by students, teachers, counselors, job developers, job seekers, and anyone else in need of information on jobs and careers. It will guide you with a step-by-step process to explore the world of work - choosing an occupation, finding the appropriate education and training, and finding the right job.
The Job & Career ConneCTion helps you identify occupations that may be a good match for your skills, interests, and personality, and provides you with detailed information on these occupations. It will help you find appropriate education and training opportunities and identify employers who may hire people for those occupations. It will also provide tools to help you get the job that is right for you - including help in writing a rum getting through the job interview, and finding day care for your children. The Job & Career ConneCTion also includes articles on relevant topics and links to other valuable sites on the Internet to help you prepare for, and get, that perfect job. We hope that our Web site connects you with helpful information as well as excellent opportunities.
