About the Interactive Tornado Map
The tornado map lets you view tornado storm records, photos and radar images.
Just click its icon on the map, or the listing in the right column (results box).Viewing information about a tornado
Only those storms which are in the latitude/longitude bounds of the map are displayed in it. Recent storms are displayed before older ones. Therefore, if you move the map causing a newer storm to be shown, an older storm will be removed to accommodate the newer one. See below for the order of priority.Which tornadoes are displayed on the map
always
By default, the Tornado Map shows all tornadoes, with the most recent storms first. You can choose to view only historically significant tornadoes by clicking on that tab, above the map itself. You can switch between these tabs and the map will keep its location and zoom level."Most Recent Storms" vs. "Historically Significant"
To avoid clutter, there is a limit (currently 12) on how many tornadoes are displayed at the same time. To view the next set of results, click at the bottom of the right column, or to view the more current storms.Paging through results

Priority level indicates which gets displayed on the map first, 1 being the highest priority. When two types have the same priority, the date of the storm determines which one is displayed first.
1. Current Tornado Warnings
A shaded polygon will indicate the region for which the warning applies. Click on the region or icon to view the warning text. Since this is current data, it will change frequently, and may not always be present.
2. Current storms capable of producing a tornado
Could be a Tornado Vortex Signature (TVS) or Mesocyclone. Since these are current storms, this data will change frequently, and may not always be present.
3. Tornadoes (official)

The photographers in our community often take pictures of the tornadoes that are on the map. In these cases, their photographs are shown with the relevant Tornado or Tornado Storm Report. See the FAQ below. WunderPhotos
Radar
Radar data is available for storms since April 2006, and selected historically significant storms. Archived radar loops are generated on-demand. So if you are the first person to click on a particular radar, it could take up to 20 seconds to generate, just this once.
