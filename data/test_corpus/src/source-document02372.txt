Environmental Issues
Potential environmental problems caused by waste treatment include for example leachate water, the formation of methane and odour and the littering of the near surroundings.
Therefore special attention is continuously paid to the environmental issues. For example, extensive water collection systems have been built to drain the waters from the landfill area to a municipal waste water treatment plant. During flood periods, the systems can be used efficiently to prevent the access of spoilt water to the near surroundings and further on to the watercourses.
The quality of surface waters and groundwaters is subject to comprehensive monitoring on the basis of the permit requirements and self-supervision. No contamination of waters at the treatment centre or in nearby areas was found during the year 2004. Water quality is monitored using a comprehensive network of observation points and with the aid of a monitoring programme.
The air quality in the area is also measured continuously. Among other things, noxious smelling sulphur compounds and particle concentrations are controlled.
Methane emissions from the landfill have been monitored systematically since 1988. Landfill gas is gathered with gas-collection systems. The amount of landfill gas recovered in 2004 was approximately 48 million m3; this was achieved via 117 gas wells and four pumping stations.
A considerable proportion of the landfill gas generated at mm ssuo is utilized in the production of district heating at E.ON Finlands plant in Kivenlahti, Espoo. In 2004, the power plant produced district heating from landfill gas equivalent to the heating requirement of about 10,000 detached houses.
