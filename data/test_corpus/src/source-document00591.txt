Socrates (469-399B.C.)
Known as the epitome of the Athenian institution of paiderastia, or boy love. Greek philosopher and teacher Socrates was known as the "wisest among men"!
He developed a way of teaching that is known today as the "Socratic method". Instead of teaching his views and ideas, he encouraged others to think for themselves, by asking them questions.
In 399 B.C. he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death on charges of corrupting the morals of the youth of Athens and advocating religious heresies, due to his criticism of political and religious institutions. At his trial, Socrates refused to acknowledge any wrong doing. He insisted that he be honored as a public benefactor for his role as a teacher.
Some of his adoring students came up with a plan for him to escape. He refused the opportunity to save himself and chose to teach the Athenians one more moral lesson through the injustice of his death. He willingly drank the hemlock that killed him.
