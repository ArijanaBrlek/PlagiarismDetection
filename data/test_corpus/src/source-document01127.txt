Indiana Public Lands
Hoosier National Forest
Located in the rolling hills of southern Indiana, lies the Hoosier National Forest. Backed against the Ohio River to the south, this Forest is within a days drive of the metropolitan centers of Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago, Evansville, and Indianapolis. The Hoosier National Forest boundary encompasses 644,163 acres, with over 192,000 acres of public land and most of the remaining in private ownership. The patchwork effect of small farms, pastures, cross road communities, and national forest give the Hoosier an interesting rural flavor.Description:
