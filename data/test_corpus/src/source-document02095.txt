[] edit History
The Connecticut State Police was formed on May 29th 1903 making it the oldest State Police force in the Nation. It was originally composed of five officers primarily responsible for interdicting the production of . Early officers traveled the state by railroad until automobile and motorcycle patrols were instituted, and troopers would often spend five to six days working, eating, and sleeping in the barracks constructed around the state. By 1924, seven such barracks had been built. The organization was heavily militaristic, and its internal culture was similar in this regard to other state police agencies in . moonshine New England
The 1940s was perhaps the greatest period of development of the State Police, which under Commissioner Edward J. Hickey saw the formalization of identified patrol cars, the founding of a forensics lab and a training academy, the introduction of state police women (the first female officers were referred to as SPW's for State Police Women and they paticipated in plain clothes investigations. Full counterparts to the males in the agency, were not included until the late 1970s) the development of the nation's first radar system, the development and establishment of the first FM two way radio communications system in the nation, and the creation of the CSP Auxiliary Trooper program which is still in existence today. During this period the state police expanded its patrol districts to eleven barracks.
In the 1960s, the barracks-focused structure of the department was reformed, leading to the modern shift schedule and allowing troopers to reside at home.
The Connecticut State Police are the primary law enforcement agency for approximately 1/2 of the State's 169 Towns. Connecticut does not have a sheriff system that participates in routine law enforcement duties, as exists in most other states.
Approximately 40 of these communities are patrolled solely by normal State Police patrols. The other communities have engaged in a cost-sharing contract agreement with the CSP known as a "Resident Trooper" which provides a Trooper assigned to the community on a full-time basis. The title dates to a time when the Resident Trooper was an actual resident of the town, and had an office and official telephone located at his personal residence. Resident Troopers have for many decades not been required to be residents of the community they are assigned to, and offices have been moved to space provided by the host community. Costs, which include salary, equipment, and cruiser, are split between the town (70%) and state (30%). In Towns that have a Resident Trooper program, the State Police will supervise and dispatch local Constables with police powers (if any). Some towns with large Resident Trooper & Constable programs will include State Police Sergeants in the Resident Trooper program to provide an appropriate level of supervision to full-time constable forces.
In 1983 under the direction of Colonel Lester J. Forst, the CSP adopted the Beretta 92F 9mm semiautomatic pistol. This made the CSP one of the first major law enforcement agencies in the nation to make the switch from the revolver to the semiautomatic pistol. The sidearm of the CSP was again updated in 1996 with the adoption of the Sig Sauer P229 .40 caliber pistol which is the current issue sidearm. (Exception being troopers assigned to the Tactical Unit, who carry a highly customized 1911 variant in .45ACP caliber.)
The CSP has been awarded the nations "Best Dressed State Agency" on numerous occasions in recognition of it's distinctive uniform.
[] edit Present-day CSP
Currently, the CSP operates out of twelve barracks known as "troops", including a troop at . Depending on their location, some troops are more responsible for interstate traffic patrol, while others are primarily used for local law enforcement in rural districts. Bradley International Airport
Whichever duty assigned, a common motto found within the CSP is -- signifying that due to the department's small size and wide geographic reach, each individual trooper must rely on his or her own individual skills in dealing with whatever situation arises. This motto infuses the department with a common culture of self-reliance and innovation."A Trooper Rides Alone"
[] edit CSP Vehicles
Connecticut State Police marked unit
The CSP fleet includes the traditional patrol vehicles ( ), SUVs, motorcycles, Cessna airplanes, and a helicopter. The CSP has had a long history of using unmarked patrol cars on the state's highways, only identifiable as police vehicles by the red and blue light bars on the top. The words "State Police" are labelled on the center of the light bar. Some of the older vehicles have a "State Trooper" placard on the rear. The CSP has also had a long history of using non-traditional unmarked patrol cars for enforcement such as Camaros, Mustangs, Grand Nationals, and most recently Chargers. These units are not equipped with light bars and instead utilize more low profile emergency lighting systems. Ford Crown Victorias
The few marked cars the CSP has in its fleet are white with the CSP shield and the words "Connecticut State Police" on the doors underscored by a blue and yellow line that runs down the side of the car. The motorcycles are white with the words "State Police" in blue and yellow on the windshield. The CSP helicopter is blue with the CSP shield and the words "Connecticut State Police" on the side.
Marked vehicles driven by Connecticut Enforcement Officers are often mistaken for State Police cruisers, since they are the same color and bear the same light bar assembly as State Police unmarked cruisers. The difference lies in that the DMV Enforcement Officers' patrol cars bear the state seal and "Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles" on the doors. Additionally, the letters "DMV" are labelled on the center of the light bar instead of "State Police." Department of Motor Vehicles
