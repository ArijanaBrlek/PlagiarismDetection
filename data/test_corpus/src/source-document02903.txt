  Tickets
 
Disneyland tickets our available for your pre-purchase adventure packages to Disneyland and other attractions throughout California. It's a great service that you can benefit from. Get your tickets before you go for this reason alone--when you arrive at Disneyland, there's always a line for tickets.  You can't escape it unless you pre-purchase. Believe it or not, a few days of the year they actually reach capacity, too, and if you don't have a ticket, you may not get to go. That happens rarely. The main reason to buy is to avoid the wait in line. That's why we offer this service and also purchase our tickets here. You will enter a secure server when you are ready to place your order.
 
Disneyland Tickets - Buying Tips
Children under 3 get in free, and anyone ten years old or older pays adult admission for Disneyland tickets.  The lowest-priced, one-day Disneyland tickets are good for only one park. In other words, you can't visit Disneyland in the morning and Disney's California Adventure in the afternoon of the same day.  Multi-day Disneyland tickets and one-day Hoppers allow you to visit both parks on the same day. The multi-day Disneyland tickets expire 13 days after the first use.  You can buy Disneyland tickets online.  Unlike other theme parks, Disneyland offers few discounts on tickets. The best way to save money on Disneyland tickets is to spend fewer days at the Disneyland theme parks.
