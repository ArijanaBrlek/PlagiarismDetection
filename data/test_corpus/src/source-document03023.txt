Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel Information
The number of view rooms is as plentiful as the laid-back, beach-resort atmosphere at Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. Guestrooms overlook the colorful Paradise Pier land of Disney's California Adventure park or relaxing views of the hotel's signature rooftop pool with its roller coaster inspired slide. Accommodations include mini-refrigerators and high-speed Internet connections. This boardwalk feel can be found in each of the deluxe Guestrooms as well. From the surfboard-shaped room number signs outside the door, to the Mickey Mouse lifeguard lamps and palm tree-lined bedspreads inside, the mood is a mix of nautical and nostalgic, but always decidedly Disney! Please note that there is a per-night resort fee of $11.50 (including tax) payable to the front desk. Rates are based on double occupancy. Charges for extra adults may apply and will be due directly to the hotel.
