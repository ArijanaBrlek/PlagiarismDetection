Welcome!
Do you love to read--to browse shelves of the latest fiction or non-fiction, enjoy classic literature or pick up a new magazine?
Do you enjoy the many resources--new bestsellers, children's books, research materials, Internet access, books-on-tape, CDs and DVDs--that the Hoboken Public Library provides?
Do you think it's important to make the Hoboken Public Library the best it can be? If so, you need to know more about the Friends!
The Friends are a group of volunteers dedicated to supporting and expanding what the Library offers to children and adults. We do this by publicizing the Library's programs and raising funds for the Library's special needs.
In past years the money we've raised has enabled the Library to purchase new books, magazine subscriptions, computers, computer furniture and Young Adult Room furniture that were beyond its regular budget. The Friends also donated the core startup collections of videos and DVD's!
The Friends sponsor a number of activities, including the Conversation Program, book sales, the oral history project, and the Library's programs for families. English as a Second Language "Vanishing Hoboken" First Saturday
