Illustrated to the right are some composite images of how we used ADT's default , and to not only allow for a range of presentation but a range of performance on your equipment.HighMediumLowDetailDisplayRepresentations
Low Detail
The Low Detail Display Representation will affect the Plan and Model Display Representations.  Railing Styles, by default, display a single line in Plan View under the Low Display Representation ( though you can add more detail ) and we stuck with this approach but changed the linetype to the "DashDot" or DashDotX2" types.  In Model (3D) View you will find that all Linework is simple and clean with all Properties managed "ByBlock" which means you can set Color, for example, by the Layer or other means.  The Hidden and Shaded modes of the Model View are illustrated to the right.
The Medium Detail Display Representation will affect the Plan and Model Display Representations.  For this Display Representation, we continue to use the same Linetype as for the Low Detail Display Representation but added the display of Columns.  In Model View you will find Material Linework such as Brick and Concrete Hatch Patterns set to Colors that match the default Materials we assigned to the various Styles ( you can, of course,  change these settings).  For the Shaded mode, you will find Colors but no Materials ( which have been set for High Detail ).Medium Detail
The High Detail Display Representation will also affect the Plan and Model Display Representations.  In Plan View you will find that we show a bit more detail than in the Medium Detail Display Representation and no Linetypes.  For Model View you will find the same Linework as under the Medium Detail Display Representation but under the Shaded mode of this View, you will find Materials display ( if set to display on the Options dialog ).  We designed this Display Representation for Rendering purposes to optimize linking to Viz Render; chain link fencing, for example, changes from lines to a chain link material.High Detail
The Content
The entire kit was designed to work with ADT's new , as illustrated to the right, and after installation you simply assemble one or more Palettes as you see fit by dragging content out of the Fences 7 eKit Catalog (from the ).Tool PalettesContent Browser
The list of fence types is broken into three primary categories: , and .  Within each of these categories are standard configurations that you can use directly or as templates for your own variations.  For Post and Rail fences, for example, there are five variations but you can easily copy and alter any of these to change dimensions, number of rails or post profiles.  For Masonry Column fences, for example, there are two variations on large estate-like configurations but you can easily create your own column designs and replace the ones we included.  Information on how to achieve such changes is included in the Fences 7 User Guide.

Some offices have highly customized template files with unique Display Representations, Sets and Configurations that may not work automatically with out kit.  We designed this kit for optimum performance using the default template files that come with ADT but all that means is that we utilized the High, Medium and Low Display Configurations.  Because some of these Display Representation are not Standard Display Representations they will be introduced automatically as will all of the Material Definition Style Display Representation Overrides that we had to use in order to produce Fence-like linework.CAD and IT Managers:
The Object Style files are devoid of undesirable Layers, Colors and Plot Styles.  With the exception of Material Definition Styles, that control Linetypes and Colors for these Object Styles, all have been set to "".PropertiesBy Block
InArchitectural Desktop 2007 improvements were made for the management of Tool Palette Catalogs and you may now Copy or Move Catalogs to any network or local drive location you wish.  However, in order to provide a default installation location, we have configured this kit to be installed locally under  "". If you choose to Move the kit, be aware that there are a few path issues that are not automatically resolved and some Tool icon's will require corrections.  The work is minimal, ten (10) minutes or so and is covered in our User Guide for this kit.Installation Issues
