About Cortaflex
Cortaflex is a nutritional supplement and, because it has beneficial effects on joints of the body, it is classed as a "nutraceutical". This means that it is not a drug and does not contain any substances which are classed as drugs. In fact although Cortaflex comes in three different formulations - for people, for dogs & cats and for horses - its ingredients are purely natural, it only contains substances which are already found in the body and the joints of the body.
Ingredients
The active ingredients in all formulations of Cortaflex are called mucopolysaccharides, which are also known as Glycosaminoglycans
Cortaflex ingredients:Glucuronic Acid, Proline, Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamine, Aspartic Acid and Glycene.
The three formulations - , and - have additional, all natural, ingredients specific to each breed which aids the digestion and absorbtion of the active ingredients. See the human, canine and equine pages for the full list of ingredients. Human Cortaflex Canine Cortaflex Equine Cortaflex

Equine Cortaflex
Cortaflex was originally developed for horses by an American nutritionist and horseman called Bruce Snipes! Humans had been taking supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin for years but Bruce knew that he had to find a way of making these substances more effective if they were to be used in the treatment of animals.

Glucosamine and Chondroitin
There are lots of supplements containing Glucosamine and Chondroitin, they all work in varying degrees, but there is a fundamental problem with them... the molecular structure of Glucosamine is large, Chondroitin even larger, and they are just too big to get out of the bloodstream into the cells in joints where they are needed. See our other website Natural Animal Health for more information about the problem with glucosamine

Joint Wear and Tear
The bones in your joints rub together - or rather, they don't! The articulating surfaces of the bones in the joints are covered in cartilage and the whole joint capsule contains synovial fluid which is an oily substance - literally "joint oil". Cartilage is slippery and synovial fluid is slippery so a normal healthy joint works well and causes no pain. However, with age and/or injury, cartilage can get worn and synovial fluid can lose its quality...the result: pain, stiffness and swelling.
How Cortaflex Works
To repair cartilage and improve synovial fluid the body needs glucosamine and chondroitin but, taken orally, these have too large a molecular size to be effective - they just don't get absorbed into the joints where they are needed. Cortaflex contains the much smaller molecules of the constituent parts of these two substances and is much better at getting into the joints...the result: the body has more of the necessary building blocks to heal its joints.
