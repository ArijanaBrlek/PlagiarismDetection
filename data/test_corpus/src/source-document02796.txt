Long title:
An Act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes.

Conceived to help , the bill was amended prior to passage to protect women, and explicitly included white people for the first time. It also created the .Civil Rights Act of 1964 Pub.L.

In order to circumvent limitations on congressional power to enforce the imposed by the Supreme Court in the , the law was passed under the , which had been interpreted by the courts as a broad grant of congressional power. Once the Act was implemented, its effects were far reaching and had tremendous long-term impacts on the whole country. It prohibited discrimination in public facilities, in government, and in employment, invalidating the in the southern U.S. It became illegal to compel segregation of the races in schools, housing, or hiring.

John F. Kennedy addresses the nation about Civil Rights on June 11, 1963
The bill was introduced by President in his civil rights speech of June 11, 1963, in which he asked for legislation "giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments," as well as "greater protection for the right to vote." John F. Kennedy [1]
He then sent a bill to Congress on June 19. Emulating the , Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. But it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.

The bill was sent to the , and referred to the , chaired by . After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee greatly strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly-owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial "Title III" that had been removed from the and Acts. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights. House of Representatives House Judiciary Committee Emmanuel Celler 1957 1960
The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963, and was then referred to the , whose chairman, , a Democrat from , indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely. It was at this point that President Kennedy was assassinated. The new president, , utilized his experience in legislative politics and the he wielded as president in support of the bill. Rules Committee Howard W. Smith Virginia Lyndon Johnson bully pulpit
Because of Smith's stalling of the bill in the Rules Committee, Celler filed a petition to discharge the bill from the Committee. Only if a majority of members signed the would the bill move directly to the House floor without consideration by Smith's committee. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, as even many congressmen who supported the civil rights bill itself were cautious about violating House procedure with the discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed. discharge petition
On the return from the winter recess, however, matters took a significant turn. The pressure of the civil rights movement, the , and the President's public advocacy of the Act had made a difference of opinion in Representatives' home districts, and soon it became apparent that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To prevent the humiliation of the success of the petition, Chairman Smith allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee. The bill was brought to a vote in the House on February 10, 1964, and passed by a vote of 290 to 130, and sent to the Senate. March on Washington

Johnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that the bill would be quickly considered by the . Normally, the bill would have been referred to the , chaired by Senator , from . Under Eastland's care, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate. Although this parliamentary move led to a brief , the senators eventually let it pass, preferring to concentrate their resistance on passage of the bill itself. Senate Senate Judiciary Committee James O. Eastland Democrat Mississippi Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield filibuster
The bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964 and the "Southern Bloc" of southern Senators led by (D-GA) launched a filibuster to prevent its passage. Said Russell "" Richard Russell We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our (Southern) states. [5]
After 54 days of filibuster, Senators (R-IL), Thomas Kuchel (R-CA), (D-MN), and Mike Mansfield (D-MT) introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would attract enough Republican votes to end the filibuster. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation. Everett Dirksen Hubert Humphrey [6]
On the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator (D-W.Va.) completed an address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 57 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.

[] edit Women's rights
The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by , a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who had strongly opposed the Civil Rights Act. The addition of "sex" to title VII is commonly described as a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by inserting objectionable amendments. Smith knew Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would vote for the amendment along with southern Democrats and get it in the final bill. Smith thought that northern Democrats would not vote for the bill due to the inclusion of gender, because the clause was opposed by which the northern Democrats aligned themselves with. Representative of Alabama later claimed, "Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights...he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights," and the records that Smith was greeted by laughter when he introduced the amendment. Howard W. Smith [10] [11] [12] [12] labor unions [12] Carl Elliott [13] Congressional Record [14]
Smith nevertheless claimed that he sincerely supported the amendment and made serious arguments in its favor. The claim was not entirely ungrounded, as Smith had long been close to , a women's rights activist who urged him to include sex as a protected category. The amendment had been forcefully promoted by the National Woman's Party and its allies in Congress, who had no desire to scuttle the Civil Rights Act. Thus, as explained in The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives...the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act s prohibition against discrimination based on sex. [14] Alice Paul [10] William Rehnquist , Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson [15]
However, the idea that banishing sex-based discrimination was ridiculous is undermined by the passage, just one year prior, of the (EPA) by the same Congress. The EPA had, as its main objective, abolished wage differentials based on sex. It seemed unlikely that, the following year, the very same Congress would view sex-based discrimination as ridiculous or that any member of that Congress would believe that the addition of sex as a protected class would scuttle the bill.

[] edit Desegregation
One of the most "damaging" arguments by the bill's opponents was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain in schools. Proponents of the bill, such as and , said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing. Humphrey said "if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race." While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes "would be making a fool of himself," two years later the said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing. racial quotas [16] Emanuel Celler Jacob Javits Hubert Humphrey [16] [16] Department of Health, Education and Welfare [16]

President Johnson speaks to a television camera at the signing of the Civil Rights Act.
The bill divided and engendered a long-term change in the demographics of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. As Vice President, Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration to introduce civil rights legislation, telling Kennedy aide that "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway." Senator warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election." The South indeed started to vote increasingly Republican after 1964. However, political scientists and have argued that this development was based more on economics than on race. Ted Sorensen [17] Richard Russell, Jr. [18] Richard Johnston Byron Schafer [19]
Although majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions. senator of Arizona voted against the bill, remarking, "You can't legislate morality." Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass Civil Rights legislation in 1957 and 1960. The reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which he viewed as a violation of individual liberty. Most Democrats from the Southern states opposed the bill, including Senators (D-TN), (D-AR), and (D-WV). Republican Barry Goldwater Albert Gore Sr. J. William Fulbright Robert Byrd

(The full text of the Act is available .) online
[] edit Title I
Barred unequal application of voter registration requirements.
"It shall be the duty of the judge designated pursuant to this section to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited."'
Title I did not eliminate literacy tests, which were one of the main methods used to exclude Black voters in the South, nor did it address economic retaliation, police repression, or physical violence against nonwhite voters. While the Act did require that voting rules and procedures be applied equally to all races, it failed to challenge the fundamental concept of voter "qualification." That is, it accepted the idea that citizens do not have an automatic right to vote but rather might have to meet some standard beyond citizenship. [20]
[] edit Title II
Outlawed discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; exempted private clubs without defining the term "private."
[] edit Title III
Prohibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, religion, gender, or ethnicity.
[] edit Title IV
Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.
[] edit Title VI
Prevented discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funding. If an agency is found in violation of Title VI, that agency can lose its federal funding.
General
This title declares it to be the policy of the United States that discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin shall not occur in connection with programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and authorizes and directs the appropriate Federal departments and agencies to take action to carry out this policy. This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs. Section 601  This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Section 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.
Section 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 USC 1009). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action "committed to agency discretion," which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.
[] edit Title VII
Title VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of   [2] et seq., prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see  ). 42 U.S.C.  2000e 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2 [21]
Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. An employer cannot discriminate against a person because of his interracial association with another, such as by an interracial marriage. [22]
In very narrow defined situations an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. In order to prove the Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between sex and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the "essence" or "central mission of the employer's business," and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on sex (Dothard v. Rawlinson, 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).(1991) 499 U.S. 187 (1977) 433 U.S. 321
Title VII allows for any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the "unlawful employment practice" for any person involved with the or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the of 1950.

Indian Tribes
Religious groups performing work connected to the group's activities, including associated education institutions;
Bona fide nonprofit private membership organizations.
The (EEOC) as well as certain (FEPAs) enforce Title VII (see  ). The EEOC and state FEPAs investigate, mediate, and may file lawsuits on behalf of employees. Every state, except Arkansas and Alabama maintains a state FEPA (see EEOC and state FEPA ). Title VII also provides that an individual can bring a private lawsuit. An individual must file a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of learning of the discrimination or the individual may lose the right to file a lawsuit. Title VII only applies to employers who employ 15 or more employees for more than 19 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.

[] edit Subsequent history
In a 1971 Supreme Court case regarding the gender provisions of the Act, the Court ruled that a company could not discriminate against a potential female employee because she had a preschool-age child unless they did the same with potential male employees. A federal court overruled an state law that barred women from obtaining jobs which required the ability to lift 25 pounds and required women to take lunch breaks when men were not required to. A Pennsylvania state court decided that printing separate job listings for men and women was illegal, which ended that practice among the country's newspapers. The ended the practice among federal jobs which designated them "women only" or "men only." [12] Ohio [12] [12] United States Civil Service Commission [12]
In 1975, a federal civil rights agency warned a school that its end-of-year father-son and mother-daughter baseball games were illegal according to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. President intervened, and the games were allowed to continue. In 1977, the Supreme Court struck down state minimum height requirements for police officers as violating the Act; women usually could not meet these requirements.

In 1974, the Supreme Court also ruled that the school district was violating non-English speaking students' rights under the 1964 act by placing them in regular classes rather than providing some sort of accommodation for them. San Francisco [24]
