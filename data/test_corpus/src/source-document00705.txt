And then it happened.
The Atari 2600 craze died and with it all the great and not so great games that were produced, which came out to literally thousands of titles. At the time there were many who thought that the game craze itself was over.
Not quite.
Over the past several years, many of the Atari and Activision titles for the 2600 have been reborn for the . Fans of Space Invaders from the early arcade days and Atari days could now play their favorite game again. The question was, with new PC technology and how far we have come since those early days, would these games stand up? Would they play the same? If they did, would people realize just how crude they were? Would they care? PC
To get an answer to these questions you would have to ask for game players themselves and most likely if you asked 100 people you would get 100 different answers.

Many of the sites are reviews of the games themselves, of which there are countless ones. Then there are thousands of sites that sell many editions of games, each edition featuring a different selection of Atari 2600 titles. The choices one has is simple mind boggling.
