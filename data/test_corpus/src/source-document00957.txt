Away Trip or Overnight Practical Jokes
1) - After a full night of partying, this will sure aggravate some poor soul when they try to get in bed and realize that you have previously remade the bed with the covers only coming up only 1/3 of the way and tucked in tight! 2) - When the Bachelor is a little buzzed, give him the best placebo of all...a water shot. The psychology of people is very interesting since when one thinks they are receiving alcohol, no matter how weak, they will start acting even more drunk. The best way to disguise the water is to give him a coke chaser, telling him the alcohol is really strong and to chase it down with another non-alcoholic drink before he can taste the 100 proof shot! Make sure he is doing his shots with his Shot Glass and drinking his coke from the Booby Mug! 3) - A favorite and very easy to do. Just place some Saran Wrap around the bowl. Make sure it is tight so you can't see the wrinkles from the plastic. Place the seat down and turn off the lights. Some unexpected guy will get back-splash! 4) - One of the easiest tricks to do. Place Lubricant, Toothpaste, Icy Hot or Vaseline under doorknobs and on toilet seats in a nice thin coat so the guy gets a surprise on contact. 5) One of the best jokes is to place a blow up doll in the Bachelor's bed and tell him that while he was out, his woman came to surprise him. I have seen this happen before and seeing the bachelor's reaction is one of the most memorable moments I will ever have about the trip, before and after he realizes its only a woman full of hot air! 6) - Nobody likes early morning wake up calls after a night of partying, which is why this is perfect for the guys staying in other hotel rooms. Just make sure they don't know it is you! 7) - The great thing about Cool-Aid is when you place it in its powder form on a drunk guy's bed before he is about to pass out, he will wake up either red (cherry flavor) or purple (grape flavor) since the powder soaks into the pours and temporarily colors the skin for the morning 8) - One of the funniest tricks is to place high quality temporary tattoos on passed out guys so in the morning they are surprised by the writing on their shoulder, ass or stomach! 9) - When a guy passes out, have a ball with some girl's make-up. The most fun way is to paint his fingernails a different color and lipstick his face in clown attire. Make sure to get a snapshot for the photo album. 10) - There is nothing like watching a guy turning on his hair dryer and get a cloud full of baby powder. Simply place a small amount of powder in the dryer (be very careful how much you place in there so it does not short out the dryer) and watch him freak when the button goes on. 11) - Place a generous amount of detergent in the back of the toilet (tub). After a few flushes, you are surely to witness something out of the Brady Bunch when Bobby placed too much suds in the washing machine. 12) - When the Bachelor is not around, place much smaller pairs of underwear in his bag and let him become confused on what happened to his own pairs. Watch him try to put the others on. It may even be funny to replace his drawers with silly costume ones that he will have to wear for the rest of the party! 13) - Wake the Bachelor up in the morning by having all his underwear spend the night in the room freezer. This is the true meaning of cold! 14) - Place a generous amount of cherry or grape powder Cool-Aid in the shower head (only if it is the kind that unscrews). When the next guy turns on the shower to get in, he won't believe his eyes! 15) - When the Bachelor or party member passes out in one room, place a significant amount of cups filled to the brim with water all around him and outward as far as possible. When he wakes up, he has no choice but to either drink or spill water to get out of the room! 16) - When the Bachelor goes in the shower with the door unlocked, send in the reinforcements to grab all the towels and clothes in the room and shut the door. When he comes out to get a towel, snap a picture of the nature boy and use it for ransom (i.e., you will get the film when you handcuff yourself to the blow up doll and give me the key). 17) - Certain toilettes have black rubber tubing that fills the bowl up after each flush. You can easily place that black tube out towards the bowl and lightly place the lid down on the tube so when the next person flushes it sprays them. Place a little toilet paper in the bowl before you leave the bathroom to force the next guy to flush before he sits down.Short Sheet The Bed
