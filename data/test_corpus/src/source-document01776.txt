We offer both cedar and pressure-treated wood fences. 
Cedar
Cedar remains one of the most popular species in wood fencing, its unbeatable quality, appearance and longevity. Cedar contains its own natural oils that act as preservatives make the wood resistant to decay and insect attack, increasing its durability and weatherability without the use of chemical treatments. Above all, the wood has a beauty all its own with colors, grains, and textures unmatched by any other fencing material. If you want colors other than cedar's own natural tones, the wood can easily be stained. Properly constructed and maintained, a cedar fence will look good for years, adding prestige and value to your home and garden.

Post On Pipe
Wood fences fall over as result of posts deteriorating from insects, rots, passage of time. Traditionally, most of fencing companies use chemically-treated lumbers that are buried directly into the ground, however, this post still don't last long enough. At our company we offer a wide variety of wooden fence styles with a solution that could last for a life time, by using Post On Pipe with top grade natural western red cedar. Each 4x4 is mounted on Schedule 40 Galvanized pipe, the same kind that is used with underground water. The post and the pipe are connected by using two heavy-duty carriage bolts; this provide excellent stability for its foundation. At Envision Landscaping, we build a variety of wooden fence styles to fit your need. For more information or a consultation, please contact us.
