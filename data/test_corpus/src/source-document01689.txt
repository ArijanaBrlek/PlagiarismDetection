"Hello! I want to thank you for maintaining your Rincon site.  It has been very helpful to me over the years! I go to the Horned Dorset every year in February, and your site has been helpful in exploring the area and finding new things to do." -Katharine McGregor
"LOVE THE SITE...and what a surprise this morning when looking at the pix in 'Rincon Today' to find one entitled a picture of my wife Caroline standing beside a green boat with me taking a picture...Millan's Boat is in the background.  We do remember someone taking pictures but details are history!...7 years ago we were going on a cruise out of San Juan and felt we (and another couple, also from Winnipeg) would like to spend a week or so on the island prior to the cruise...(at this time our travel agent just threw her hands up and said, "You are on your own - I know very little etc. etc.")...and then found Casa Serena, a five minute walk down the beach which we love. 2004 will be our fifth year there; another glorious 5 weeks of sun, fun, adventure, and the renewal of wonderful friendships we have established over the years."Art Imitates Life at Barrero Beach...-Jerry & Caroline Lenover, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
"Thanks for your informative emails.  I was born in NY and raised in Barrio Cruces, Rincon.  I've  lived in New Jersey for about 10 years, but I will always love my town and miss it very much. Thanks again, seeing those pictures, Oh, my God!, brought tears to my eyes.  I hope to visit Rincon in the near future. Meanwhile, keep me posted about the good news and the beauty of my town." -Yolanda Noriega
"The website is looking better all the time.  We bought a house in Rincon at Corcega beach a little over two years ago and come down every chance we get." -Garry Howard
"I was feeling a little homesick today, and it sure was great to see your site.  It made me feel like home.  I truly believe that Rincon is the most beautiful municipality that Puerto Rico has to offer.  It's truly a relaxation corner.  Thanks so much for giving me a little piece of home.  I live in the north New Jersey countryside and you better believe that in my living room sits a wonderful sunset picture with the words "Rincon, Puerto Rico" under it.  I'm proud to be from Rincon!" -Sandra Vquez
"Just returned from another two plus weeks in Rincon and we can't wait to return.  In fact, we have already made plans to return - which will be our sixth trip.  WE LOVE IT!  The beaches, the people, the restaurants, the great bakeries and of course, the Horned Dorset Primavera." -Abe & Andi Morris
