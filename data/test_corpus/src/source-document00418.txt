Diabetes: Causes, Treatments, Management, Diets and Menus
Diabetes can come in three different forms, and can arise because of the inability of pancreatic cells to produce insulin. The sickness can lead to several complications, including tissue damage and predisposition to cardiovascular disease. To manage it, a strict regimen of exercise, weight loss, and proper diet is required. An overview of diabetes can help people understand how this disease can cause damage to the body.
Diabetes, commonly known as diabetes mellitus, occurs when the levels of sugar are high in the bloodstream. Because the bloodstream supplies oxygen and nutrients to key organs in the body, high sugar levels can damage tissues and make sufferers more prone to illness. According to the World Health Organization, there are three principal types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and pregnancy related (or gestational) diabetes.
No matter what the kind of diabetes, the illness occurs because of the inability of insulin-producing cells of the pancreas to produce the right amounts of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that is tasked with breaking down sugars in the blood in order for the body to use them as an energy source.
Diabetes: The Illness
In Type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the bodys own immune system. In Type 2 diabetes, loss of function of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas leads to the bodys tissues being slowly resistant to the effects of insulin. In gestational or pregnancy-related diabetes, on the other hand, hormones associated with pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance.
Although diabetes Types 1 and 2 are incurable, they can be managed with insulin shots and other medications or diet regimens. For instance, there is a special diabetes type ii diet, which involves lowering ones intake of sugar or carbohydrates. Gestational diabetes will usually disappear or subside after the child is delivered.
Diabetes can lead to many medical complications, especially without the proper management regimen. For instance, buildup of whole sugars in the blood can lead to a coma. There are also long-term complications, such as a predisposition to cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, damage to the retina, damage to the bodys nerves, damage to capillaries and small blood vessels, impotence, and excessive bleeding or poor healing of cuts and wounds. Diabetic foot pain is also common, and it can often lead to gangrene that will, in turn, require amputation.
Diagnosis
In the old days of medicine, diabetes was loosely known as sweet-urine disease, since urine tended to be rich in unprocessed sugars, and could attract ants. With more research, technology, and observation of large groups of diabetics, there are more sure signs that you will need to watch out for.
Doctors frequently refer to a classic triad of symptoms associated with diabetes. These include polyuria, or frequent urination; increase in thirst with an increase in intake of fluids, or polydipsia; and polyphagia, or bigger appetites. People with diabetes will often experience weight loss. The symptoms appear fairly quickly in Type 1 diabetics, especially children, and appear with other symptoms such as weight loss even with increased food intake, as well as fatigue that is hard to manage or take away. The symptoms are slower to appear in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Diagnosis also consists of blood tests and other physical examinations. For instance, because high levels of blood sugar can change the shape of the eyes lenses, people with diabetes tend to have vision changes, and blurred vision will often contribute to a positive diagnosis of diabetes. Other signs to watch out for are an acetone-like smell on patients breath, rapid and deep breathing, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and extreme mood changes.
Managing the Disease
Although natural cures for diabetes are often advertised, there is no known cure for it, and doctors will emphasize avoiding complications of diabetes by managing the disease. This can be achieved through different combinations of insulin intake, diet, and exercise. Type 1 diabetics need constant doses of intravenous insulin, although type 2 diabetics, if diagnosed early, can be given oral medication. Type 2 diabetics also have to undergo strict diet, weight loss, and exercise regimens to stave off the possibility of increased blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Such a regimen can include staying off alcohol and tobacco, a controlled diet, and drugs aside from insulin.
Health insurance for diabetics can be expensive. This is because diabetics need to have regular consultations with a variety of medical specialists, and are at a higher risk for a variety of sicknesses. In order to make up for insurance or health care costs, some diabetics look for discount diabetic supplies that can help them stay healthy without going off budget. This might include cheaper diabetes socks, low-cost but high-quality oral insulin, and even a diabetes bracelet to alert anyone to the patients condition should a diabetes attack occur.
Research continues in the field of diabetes, and soon, there may be cures in the form of more efficient transplants, or even stem cell renewal of the pancreas and kidney. As work in the laboratory continues, doctors are finding more ways to manage the disease, and to make sure that diabetics live healthy, productive lives. With more education, as well as an overview of diabetes, people can better appreciate how difficult it is to treat and deal with this disease.
