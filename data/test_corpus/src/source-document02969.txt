For either recreation or transportation, electric scooters offer major advantages over gas-powered scooters: We believe these benefits far outweigh the speed and distance advantages of gas-powered scooters. (Long ranges on a scooter are tiring. Consider an electric bike instead.) To help the undecided, we offer
People ride electric scooters because they:
crave the feel of stand-up scooting -- like skiing on land;
enjoy making local errands fun, quick and easy;
like to save money, meet new people, and protect the environment;
still need convenient, point-to-point transportation after losing their driving privleges;
want their own traffic "lane", convenient parking spots and shortcuts;
would use public transportation if they could avoid the "long walk";
regularly travel farther than the 1-mile range of ; kick scooters
deserve more fun and freedom in their lives.
Electric scooters are allowed on public transit (bus/train/plane); gas-powered scooters are prohibited.
Electric scooters are allowed inside public buildings; gas-powered scooters are prohibited.
Noise and air pollution of gas-powered scooters is eliminated (along with public disapproval).
Due to the simplicity of electric motors, less maintenance is required.
Electric motors provide quick starts and hill-climbing without the delay of gas engine "ramp up".
Although often purchased as a "toy", electric scooters often live long lives as transportation.

"I bought the Zappy mainly for fun, and that it is. It is definitely one cool little scooter. Personally though, if I was going to spend money for a transportation vehicle, I would opt for one of the electric motor add-on kits for my bicycle.

Bikes, with a rack or trailer, can easily carry extra items."
Scooters we rate as offer superior value resulting from a combination of factors:"Best Buys"
manufacturer's number of years in the U. S. electric scooter market;
solid company (experience, resources, and commitment) behind the e-scooter;
quality and performance;
after-sale service and support;
innovation or niche-market appeal.
For most people, top speed is less important than range and reliability. Although scooter speed, range and weight vary, all three correlate well with with one another - and are inversely proportional to portability. So, we've ranked our Best Buys by weight/portability with the smaller/lighter/slower scooters at the top:
