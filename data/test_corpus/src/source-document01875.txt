·Monday Nights 7 - 9 p.m. are reserved for beginners
so you have the work shop all to yourselves to work and learn with instructors. Please make an appointment for your first instruction with the Clubs WorkShop Manager (see application). Appointments thereafter are made with the instructor. Once you have completed your first cabochon you will want to move into other nights to make room for other new members.
Below is an example of the stages you will go through to make your first cabochon. First you start out with a slice of rock, draw an oval on it and start grinding the stone away. You will take the stone through many differnt steps to achieve a nicely polished and domed stone.
