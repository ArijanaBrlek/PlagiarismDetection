The smaller towns in the area have long depended on Dexter for employment and accessibility to commerce.Dexter's Economy
Dexter's labor force has predominately been devoted to the manufacture of shoes and machinery, with craftsmen and machine operators being the more common occupations. During the last several years, with the impact of technology in the manufacturing sector, there has been a substantial increase in the local workforce skilled in leading edge technology.
Dexter Shoe Company and the Fayscott Company have been long-time residents in Dexter; however, recent downturns in the manufacturing sector have resulted in a substantial reduction of jobs in the area. This turn of events presents an opportunity for new industry to take advantage of the availability of a substantial labor force, as well as access to excellent manufacturing facilities being vacated by Dexter Shoe.
