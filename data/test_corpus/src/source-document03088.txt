Introduction to Brazil
 
City of God certainly didn't do any favors for the Brazilian tourism board. That violent expos into the brutal theatre of dilapidated nihilism, while an important piece of visceral film making, certainly couldn't have served as a very effective advertisement to world-weary tourist dollars. Fortunately, there is an extremely large chance that your own trip to Brazil will come and go without you ever being attacked by a feral tribe of deadly children, a la William Golding. In fact, Brazil is not on the State Department's watch list, and is currently raking in the tourist dollars. Deservedly so. This country, is enormous, only slightly smaller than the United States, and affords a giant swathe of possibilities. Explore tropical rain forests, head back to civilization for some maddening excess in the fleshy streets of Carnival, and splash out in the meandering rivers ribboning the land. A favorite destination of adventure travelers, Brazil offers some world-class trekking routes. Besides ambulating odysseys, swim into some snorkeling, island hopping, and scuba diving, only a handful of the myriad adventures awaiting in the jungles of South Americas biggest nation. The per capita GDP was last ranked around 8,600 dollars, making a trip to Brazil an affordable option for bearers of the Euro, Pound, Dollar, or Yen. The food's not half bad either. Famous for the churrasco (barbecue) the national dish is certainly not for vegetarians. Brazil is the world's leading meat producer, it's national herd is 165 million strong, second only to India's at 245 million. Unfortunately for fans of BBQ lost in the eternal Yoga retreats of India, that country's sacred cow philosophies drastically curb any potential for a decent grill up. Not to worry, Brazil has a pretty good idea how to do just that, it's churrascarias (BBQ restaurants) serve at least 10 kinds of meat: the traditional cuts of beef, as well as pork, chicken, sausages, chicken hearts and even some wild meat like alligator and boar. If eating wild game is your foodie passion, don't forget to make your way over to Nairobi, Kenya. Carnivore restaurant, a national favorite, might just be the pre-safari African response to the good'n gamey grilling that Brazil has gaucho going.
