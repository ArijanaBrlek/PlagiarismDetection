CustomCartography
The unparalleled cartographic excellence that National Geographic is known for is now available to organizations with a story to tell. Our tradition of meticulous, handcrafted mapmaking is enhanced with the latest technologies, including geographic information systems, satellite imagery, 3D modeling, and visualization techniques.
Thematic Maps
We have created a portfolio of custom thematic maps for non-governmental organizations ranging from the American Bird Conservancy to the World Bank, and commercial clients such as Dow and Ford. On each project we work closely with the client to develop an editorial concept that meets their objectives. We provide design services and thoroughly research all editorial and cartographic content, meeting clients’ expectations and producing maps reflective of our reputation for editorial accuracy and excellence.
Geotourism Maps
In partnership with National Geographic Missions, we have created a new line of Sustainable Geotourism maps. The program’s goal is to sustain and enhance the natural character of a specific place using maps as a catalyst for involvement with people in the region. These custom maps depict the rich cultural heritage, historical background, recreational amenities, travel related information, and sites and festivals.
