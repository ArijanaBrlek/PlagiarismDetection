Which is better for my heart  butter or margarine?
Margarine usually tops butter when it comes to heart health.
Margarine is made from vegetable oils, so it contains no cholesterol. Margarine is also higher in “good” fats  polyunsaturated and monounsaturated  than butter is. These types of fat help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad,” cholesterol, when substituted for saturated fat. Butter, on the other hand, is made from animal fat, so it contains cholesterol and high levels of saturated fat.
and some may even be worse than butter. Most margarines are processed using a method called hydrogenation, which adds unhealthy trans fats. In general, the more solid the margarine, the more trans fats it contains  so stick margarines usually have more trans fats than do tub margarines. Like saturated fats, trans fats increase blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In addition, trans fats can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good,” cholesterol levels.But not all margarines are created equal
When choosing a margarine, try to find one with the lowest trans fat content possible and less than 3 grams total of saturated plus trans fats. Manufacturers are now required to list saturated and trans fats separately on food labels.
There are also spreads  such as Benecol and Take Control  that contain phytosterols, natural plant compounds that have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 6 percent to 15 percent when eaten in recommended amounts.
Is Heat or Ice Better for Arthritis Pain?
Published April 25, 2005 in and . General Questions Closed
You probably know that applying heat or ice to a painful joint can help relieve pain, but have questions about these simple techniques. Which one? Why? How often? How long?
The only time you must choose ice is during the first 48 hours after a sudden injury or surgery. Cooling the area causes the nearby blood vessels to constrict; there is less swelling, so there is less pain. Heat opens up the areas blood vessels, improving the flow. Increased circulation brings oxygen and healing elements to the scene, while flushing away wastes: in with the good, out with the bad.
