 
Graduate Student Internships for University of Oregon Students at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
The Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) is Oregon's first Signature Research Center.  A cooperative venture among government and world-class nanoscience and microtechnology R&D institutions and industry in the Northwest, ONAMI was created to cultivate research and commercialization to advance Oregon's leading economic sector and expand the benefits of technology innovation to traditional and natural resource industries. ONAMI’s community of world-class industry, academic and federal research institutions in the Pacific Northwest forms a vibrant network of nanoscience and microtechnology expertise that is moving nanoscience and microtechnology innovations from basic research through to commercialization.  ONAMI partners Oregon State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Portland State University, and the University of Oregon (UO). As part of the partnership, the UO Materials Science Institute has established a graduate internship program at PNNL.  In this program, UO students spend three or more months at PNNL participating in current research in multiscale materials and devices.  Students may choose to conduct part of their thesis work at PNNL thereafter under the guidance of a PNNL researcher as part of collaborative research between the Lab and the university. The application process is electronic; to apply, visit reference job posting number 112730.  For further information on education programs, visit .  PNNL’s on-site dormitory, the Guest House (), is well-suited to visiting students and faculty and is located within walking distance to most PNNL facilities.  PNNL can also provide information on local apartments or other housing arrangements.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, is dedicated to delivering innovative science-based solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing problems.  As one of the U.S. Department of Energy’s multiprogram national laboratories, PNNL conducts a wide range of fundamental and applied research that addresses important national missions.  Through its scientific and technical contributions, PNNL seeks to strengthen U.S. scientific foundations for innovation, prevent and counter acts of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, increase U.S. energy capacity and reduce dependence on imported oil, and reduce the effects of energy generation and use on the environment.
Research opportunities at PNNL are truly extraordinary.  Our staff of 4,200 scientists, engineers, and support staff are harnessing nanotechnology to provide safe and reliable energy sources, building new instruments to observe chemical processes in living cells, and developing miniaturized sensors to detect pathogens in food and the environment.  These are just a few examples of the exciting science and technology projects that keep our staff on the leading edge of new discoveries.
To rapidly translate those discoveries into new products and processes, we partner with universities, industry, and other government laboratories.  These partnerships leverage research and development resources, promote collaboration on complex interdisciplinary issues, and provide hands-on opportunities for students in technical fields.
Key to PNNL’s success is the William R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, one of the newest scientific user facilities in the DOE complex.  Our researchers in EMSL are tackling challenges in fundamental science that will pave the way for the next generation of science and technology solutions in energy, the environment, health, and national security.  Other important facilities operated by PNNL include the Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sequim, Washington, and offices in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C.
Battelle Memorial Institute has operated the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 1965.  A world-wide technology development and commercialization company, Battelle is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
