The earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the definition of "map" is not sharp and because some artifacts speculated to be maps might actually be something else. A wall painting which may depict the ancient Anatolian city of (previously known as Catal Huyuk or atal H y k) has been dated to the late .

Due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the , published in 1715 by . This map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by . De Fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by , published in 1697, and , in 1664. By the 1700s, map-makers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase "After [the original cartographer]" on the work.

In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment and therefore varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the and much later devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to store and manipulate them digitally. compass magnetic storage
Advances in mechanical devices such as the , and allowed for the mass production of maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions from more accurate data. Optical technology, such as the , and other devices that use telescopes, allowed for accurate surveying of land and the ability of mapmakers and navigators to find their by measuring angles to the at night or the at noon. printing press quadrant vernier telescope sextant latitude North Star sun
Advances in photochemical technology, such as the and , have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps. lithographic photochemical processes
In the late 20th century and early 21st century advances in electronic technology led to a new revolution in cartography. Specifically, devices such as computer screens, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters along with visualization, image processing, spatial analysis and database software, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials.

[] edit General vs thematic cartography

In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:63,360 (1 inch to 1 mile) "Ordnance Survey" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. United States Geological Survey
involves maps of specific geographic themes oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties divided into numerical classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.

An map combines both general and thematic cartography, designed for a very specific user community. The most prominent thematic element is shading that indicates degrees of difficulty of travel due to vegetation. The vegetation itself is not identified, merely classified by the difficulty ("fight") that it presents. orienteering

A is a very general type of map, the kind you might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. Beck's map is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of "The Tube," it preserves little of reality. It varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions haphazardly. The only traits the map preserves are the order of the stations and crossings along the tracks, and whether a station or crossing is north or south of the . Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose. topological map London Underground River Thames [13]

, an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed "will be a cartographic failure." He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that "map design is perhaps the most complex." Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs. Arthur H. Robinson [14]
From the very beginning of mapmaking, maps "have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes". The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson. The principle of refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the users experience and keep his attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.

Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. explains that a well designed map "is convincing because it implies authenticity" (1994, pp. 9). An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the "needed link" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it (Monmonier, 1993, pp. 93).

[] edit Naming conventions
Most maps use text to places and for such things as a map title, legend, and other information. Maps are often made in specific languages, though names of places often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name for that country, while a German map would use , and French map . A word that describes a place using a non-native terminology or language is referred to as an . label GermanyDeutschlandAllemagne exonym
In some cases the proper name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to , but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use . Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of for , for , and for . Myanmar BurmaSaigon Ho Chi Minh City Bangkok Krung Thep Ivory Coast C te d'Ivoire
Difficulties arise when or between is required. National names tend to have well established names in other languages and writing systems, such as for >AA8O, but for many placenames a system of transliteration or transcription is required. In transliteration the symbols of one language are represented by symbols in another. For example, the letter is traditionally written as in the . Systems exist for transliteration of , but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh, Mocca, and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is transformed into the Latin alphabet through the phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as , resulting in the city being spelled on newer English maps and on older ones. transliteration transcription writing systems Russia Cyrillic R Latin alphabet Arabic Mocha Pinyin Wade-Giles BeijingPeking
Further difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both and . In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. is also officially named .

[] edit Map symbology
The quality of a maps design affects its readers ability to extract information, and to learn from the map. Cartographic has been developed in an effort to portray the world accurately and effectively convey information to the map reader. A legend explains the pictorial language of the map known as its symbology. The title indicates the region the map portrays; the map image portrays the region and so on. Although every map element serves some purpose, convention only dictates inclusion of some elements while others are considered optional. A menu of map elements includes the neatline (border), or north arrow, overview map, scale bar, , and information about the map sources, accuracy and publication. symbology compass rose projection
When examining a landscape, scale can be intuited from trees, houses and cars. Not so with a map. Even such a simple thing as a north arrow is crucial. It may seem obvious that the top of a map should point north but this might not be the case.
Color likewise is equally important. How the cartographer displays the data in different hues can greatly affect the understanding or feel of the map. Different intensities of hue portray different objectives the cartographer is attempting to get across to the audience. Today, personal computers can display up to 16 million distinct colors at a time even though the human eye can distinguish only a minimum number of these (Jeer, 1997). This fact allows for a multitude of color options for even for the most demanding maps. Moreover, computers can easily hatch patterns in colors to give even more options. This is very beneficial when symbolizing data in categories such as quintile and equal interval classifications.
Quantitative symbols give a visual measure of the relative size/importance/number that a symbol represents and to symbolize this data on a map there are two major classes of symbols used for portraying quantitative properties: Proportional symbols change their visual weight according to a quantitative property. These are appropriate for extensive statistics. portray data collection areas (such as counties, or census tracts) with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration (Harvard Graduate School of Design, 2005). Choropleth maps
[] edit Map generalization
A good map has to provide a compromise between portraying the items of interest (or ) in the for the map used, against the need to annotate that item with text or a symbol, which takes up space on the map medium and very likely will cause some other item of interest to be displaced. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a incorrect place - because of the demands of the annotation. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e the map shows a larger area), because relatively, the annotation on the map, takes up more space . A good example from the late 1980s was the 's first digital maps, where the positions of major roads shown at scales of 1:1250 and 1:2500 were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from , when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250000 and 1:625000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features. themes right place scale slightlyon the ground Ordnance Survey absolute ground truth
