"Discover Queens" has become the brand name for tourism in the borough, said Michelle Stoddart, director of marketing and tourism for the Queens Economic Development Corporation.
At the Queens Tourism Council's Web site, www.DiscoverQueens.info, Stoddart said, more than 91,000 people have logged on during the first five months of 2007. "We've been working hard on this for quite some time," said Borough President Helen Marshall.
"Queens is the official gateway to New York," said Terri Osborne, director of culture and tourism for the borough president.
On July 22, up to 200,000 people will flock to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park for the Colombian Independence Day festival. Celebrating Colombia's separation from Spain in 1819, there will be music, food and dancing from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call 718- 699-4833.
Following up, the colorful Dragon Boat Festival will take place on August 4 and 5 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. More than 10,000 people are expected to come to the Meadow Lake area to watch teams participate.
Each dragon boat has a crew of 18 or more. Sitting side by side to row, one person steers the boat at the rudder. There is also a drummer, setting a pace for the crew. Traditionally, dragon boats are about 38 feet long. Decorated in brilliant colors, the sleek and speedy boats are made of teakwood and fiberglass and have a dragon's head and tail painted at the prow and stern, respectively.
There will also be music, performances and food at the event which takes place from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. For more information, call 718-767-1776 or visit www.hkdf.ny.org.
The 186th anniversary of Peru's independence is also celebrated at Flushing Meadows- Corona Park at the Peruvian Festival held on August 19. More than 10,000 people are expected to attend from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call 646- 523-5577.
Stoddart said the New York Mets, in partnership with the Queens Tourism Council, will hold a "Discover Queens Night" celebration before their 7:10 p.m. game with the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 25.
The US Open, held between August 27 and September 9 this year, will also partner with the Discover Queens tourism initiative.
The Web site lists attractions, restaurants, shopping, tours, hotels and coupons for Queens members. For example, coupons for the New York Hall of Science, Museum of the Moving Image, Queens Museum of Art and Alley Pond Environmental Center are available.
Looking beyond summer, Restaurant Week will be held again from September 17 through 27. Restaurants are encouraged to offer prix fixe meals at $20.07 from Monday through Thursday during the 10-day period. Stoddart said at least 100 restaurants will participate this year.
In December, Queens will celebrate the 350th anniversary of the Flushing Remonstrance. Signed by 30 Flushing residents on December 27, 1657, the Remonstrance defied a ban by Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant and called for religious freedom. It is widely considered to be a significant predecessor to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
