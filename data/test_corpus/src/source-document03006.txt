Everybody do the split ... refund!
Here's an idea whose time has come: split refunds. This year, for the first time, the IRS is letting us split our refunds among up to three direct-deposit accounts. No longer do we have to wait for one big, fat amount and then split it up ourselves.
I like this idea for two reasons. First, it acknowledges that while most of us would like to save a portion of our refunds, we may also have leftover holiday and winter-break bills to pay. (For advice on what do do with a refund, check .) Second, it forces taxpayers to use direct deposit, which is more secure and faster than a paper check. Many happy tax returns
To do a split refund, you'll have to follow a few rules and fill out Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund to More Than One Account, available on the page of the IRS Web site. Forms and Publications
Interestingly, while split refunds can only be done through electronic funds transfers, you don't have to file your tax form electronically to use them. But I recommend you try filing electronically anyway. The IRS reports that electronically-filed forms contain fewer errors than paper forms, and generate refunds about two weeks faster.
