Diorama by Norman Bel Geddes, depicting combat air patrol intercepting the incoming Japanese dive bomber raid on USS (CV-5), at about noon on 4 June 1942. Most of the Japanese planes were shot down by F4F-4 fighters, but several survived to drop bombs on or near . Markings on the F4Fs are not accurate for this time period, as the fuselage stars are too small.Photo #: 80-G-701874 Battle of Midway, June 1942
