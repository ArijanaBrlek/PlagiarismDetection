KOOLAS TO TIPIS TO TULE HUTS
cus is on the architecture of American Indians in a variety of time periods.
Key Ideas: American Indians, American Indian Architecture/Structures, Early American History, Architectural Development
What will happen at the Explorit Discovery Lesson?
When the word tipi is mentioned, most Americans bring to mind a picture of the traditional housing structure of the American Plains Indians. Even though the tipi, pueblo and other American Indian architecture is a symbol of America itself, how much do we really know about the structures that early American Indians chose to create and live in? The variety of dwellings is , but many are unaware of their diversity and usefulness. During this exhibit we will explore the science behind some American Indian dwellings from . We will explore this topic from an architectural point of view, understanding that architecture is not strictly scientific but also is affected by economics, technology, social customs, religion, the environment, aesthetics, etc. Even though American Indian cultures are incredibly rich and varied, we will concentrate primarily on the science behind their unique dwelling designs.huge

What will we discover at Explorit?
You and your students will:
identify the basic needs for survival and find out how American Indians satisfied the need for shelter in particular.
draw parallels between your shelter needs now and shelter needs of American Indians in various time periods.
encounter the variety of American Indian dwellings.
explore the various uses of these dwellings.
discover the construction techniques used to provide protection in various climates.
investigate different building techniques and materials.
Questions to Tickle Your Mind:
What cultures have dwellings? Can you think of any that don't?
Think about your own dwelling. Why is it built the way it is built?
If you were to design a dwelling for living in Southern California, what features would be essential? What about for West Africa? Siberia? The moon?
Our resources are becoming more and more limited. What new (or recycled) resources could we consider for building our dwellings?
Do any American Indians still live in traditional dwellings? If so, why? If not, why not?
Background Information:
To help you apply the California Science Framework (1990), we have written the key words, or "big ideas," in .boldface
As varied and diverse as American Indian culture is, we could not possibly cover it all adequately within the scope of this one exhibition. Our foNote:
How does energy play a role in Indian architecture?
The basic purpose of any shelter is to provide protection from the climate, whether it is hot or cold. Architects design all dwellings, historic and modern, to conserve American Indians do this as well. For example, the Pueblo Indians of the southwest built homes of clay, rocks and plant materials (some still do). These adobe homes soaked up the sun's during the day, while keeping the inside cool and shaded, and then radiated the heat into the rooms at night. The Plains Indians tipis, in their varied forms, were adjustable to accommodate the weather. In cold weather, the tipis' walls had two layers of buffalo skins with grass or moss stuffed between the layers in order to provide more insulation, and the bottom of the outside skin was buried in the snow. In warm weather, the American Indians lifted the skins up from the ground to allow breezes to flow through the tipi. On the hottest days, the inhabitants pulled off the skins almost entirely so that the tipi provided only shade.energy.energy
Another important source of for the American Indians was fire. They used fire to cook their meals, warm their homes, aid in their artistic and religious endeavors, etc. Many times the main hearth was inside of their dwelling. Because of the smoke, American Indian architects had to consider ventilation patterns to provide adequate ventilation of their dwellings. (This still must be considered today.) All dwellings in which fires were built had smoke holes of some sort, and most American Indians put their firepits in the center of their dwelling to ensure the most efficient heating and dissipation of smoke. The Chippewa, a tribe from the Great Lakes region, built dwellings called wigwams, dome shaped structures made of maple or ironwood saplings and elm, cedar or basswood bark. The floor of the Chippewa wigwam consisted of large stones covered with moss and straw mats. The fire for the wigwam was built into a recess in the floor which heated the rocks that provided warmth for the wigwam after the fire died. Responding to the climate was not the only motivating force behind American Indian architecture. Technology, economics, social organization, religion and history all played important roles in how, where, when and why structures were built. For example, the materials in their environment certainly influenced their building techniques. But American Indian dwellings were incredibly varied. They were domical in form (wigwam, wikiup, tule hut, hogan), conical in form (tipi, earthlodge, pit house), and rectilinear in form (chickee, longhouse, pueblo, plank house). They had bent frames (wigwam, wikiup, grass house), post and beam frames (lean-to, plank house, long house, earthlodge) and compression frames (pueblo, tipi, hogan). The tribe's social organization would determine where, how, when and by whom the dwellings were built. For instance, in some tribes, building the houses was the duty of the women. In other tribes, this duty was shared, whereas in still others, men were primarily responsible for building dwellings. American Indian architecture was directed beyond merely meeting the most basic needs of survival, most tribes expended additional to build dwellings which they used exclusively for ceremonial purposes. Further, many tribes decorated their dwellings quite elaborately.energy
What other factors affected American Indian architectural design?

How did structures change over time?
The most important and obvious occuring with American Indian dwellings was a seasonal change. Most tribes were, at least, semi-nomadic. This means that they moved from place to place often following herds of prey animals. Because they locations, they also had to move their houses. Some tribes, like the Plains Indians, moved their homes with them. Others, such as many Northwest tribes, moved out of more permanent winter homes on the coast, to very temporary summer homes in the mountains.changechanged
However, just as Euro-American architecture has over time, so has American Indian architecture. One of the most notable examples is that of the Pueblo Indians and their ancestors, the Anasazi. Anthropologists believe that the Anasazi originally lived in pit houses, semi-subterranean dwellings with roofs made of natural materials. Eventually, the Anasazi moved from the pit houses to adobe houses built above ground and often in large niches in cliffs. Remnants of the zenith of Anasazi architecture are located in Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico. Chaco contains four large, apartment-like structures, the largest of which is called Pueblo Bonito. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms and 37 kivas (religious rooms). It is four stories tall at the rear and covers nearly two acres of land.evolved
Activities:
The starred (*) activities are recommended pre-visit activities.
1. *Design-a-Dwelling
Paper
Pens, crayons, pencils or paint
Inspire students to design a dwelling. Give some direction for their ideas. For example, suggest they design a dwelling for a certain place like their hometown, the Arctic or the moon. Encourage them to think fully about the environment. What is it like? Are there different seasons? What materials are available? Or allow them to come up with their own environment, but encourage them to describe the environment they choose so that they can design their dwelling with appropriate adaptations. Share their ideas verbally with their classmates. Discuss why they designed their dwelling the way they did. What are the dwelling's adaptations to the environment?Action
Mind
What are the advantages of this exercise? What do you know that American Indians not have known a hundred years ago? Or did the American Indians have advantages?might
What kind of information was required to carry out this activity?
2. Build-a-Dwelling
(Could require a variety of materials--see below)Material
This activity is an extension of "Design-a-Dwelling." After the student has designed his/her dwelling, build a model of it. Models can be very small (like a doll house) or nearly life-size. Perhaps the class could work together on a few models which are chosen by a silent vote. This can be a very challenging activity because of the difficulties in converting a two- dimensional concept into a three-dimensional entity. Again, encourage sharing and group work so that the children can learn from each other.Action
Mind
What were the difficulties with this activity?
In what ways can a designer communicate with a builder?
What factors must be considered to build a dwelling? What must be considered when designing a community with several dwellings? (Hint: weather patterns, wind direction, family status and association, protection, etc.)
3. *A Closer Look at Home
None.Material
Action
This is a brainstorming activity that can be done in small groups or as a class. Ask your students the question, "What makes your home comfortable to you?" Encourage the students to consider the advantages and disadvantages of modern homes. Why are they built the way they are built? Why is the main entrance in the front? Why do we build only one and two story homes for the most part? Why are they "squarish" and not "roundish?" Why are they painted?
Mind
What makes a dwelling a home?
How do our homes differ from American Indian homes of the past or present?
How are they similar?
Why do we live with (usually) only one family per house or apartment?
4. *Architectural Digest
Pictures of American Indian dwellings
Action
Collect as many pictures as possible of different American Indian dwellings.
Discuss how the types of dwellings were affected by where the
people lived. American Indians lived all over the United States and Canada.
What is the climate like in various locations around North America?
Are there forests, prairies, or deserts?
Did the tribe move around a lot?
For older grades, this could be an individual or small group project. The resource list includes several books that would be useful in this activity.
Mind
How do American Indian dwellings compare with yours? (Think past and present).
Do you think that you would be comfortable in a tipi on the plains?
