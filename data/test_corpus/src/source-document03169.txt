dNeero Social Surveys Sunday, February 24th, 2008 | with Online Survey Reviews No Comments »
Here’s a new survey site I found recently that’s great for all you out there with MySpace, Facebook or similar accounts. The site is called dNeero and they feature social surveys.
Now what is a social survey you might ask (I know I did). They are surveys that let you post your answers to your blog or social network profile so other can react and interact with them.
Now I haven’t been really active with social networks, but I do have a and I think this is a cool idea. And the coolest part is they pay you to take the surveys and pay you more when others respond to the surveys you post to your social profiles. Current surveys listed pay anywhere from $0.75 to $11.00 which isn’t bad considering the surveys take just a few minutes to take. Hi5 profile
The site went into public beta on June 25th 2007 so it’s still a fairly new site, but it looks to be growing pretty well with over 29,000 surveys taken as of today. And the dNeero surveys have been shown over 3.3 million times. That’s a lot of survey views.
My first survey is below, simply click the banner to see the questions and my answers and to take the survey yourself to get started with dNeero. Oh and have fun with it!

You can sign up for the Yale School of Management eLab here
I’ve found that it is very easy to be chosen for awards from The Yale School of Management eLab and The Yale Center for Customer Insights. The reason for this is that the surveys are limited to a certain number of people. In some cases your odds of being chosen are as good as 50-1. This is a huge improvement over the large internet survey companies where you may be one in tens of thousands taking a survey or screener.
The Yale Center for Customer Insights, through the Yale School of Management eLab is able to test marketing and customer satisfaction theories quickly and effectively. They provide insight and understanding into customer behavior that can be used to improve business and society. Because of the Yale school of Managements relationship with it’s corporate affiliates your opinions can easily influence decisions made at such companies as PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Samsung. I hope you enjoyed this Yale eLab review.
