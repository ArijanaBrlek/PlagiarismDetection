purchasing an ultra-low flush (ULF) toilet
TOILET LEAK DETECTION AND REPAIRToilets are the leading cause of household water leaks. Yet they are easy to detect, and relatively easy to repair. Even a small toilet leak can cost you $50 or more per year in higher water and sewer bills. Large leaks waste much more.
When your toilet is functioning properly, water moves from the tank to the bowl only when the toilet is flushed. But when a toilet is leaking, water moves from tank to bowl on its own. You may notice that your toilet seems to flush by itself; that is a definite sign of a toilet leak.
Testing for a toilet leak consists of dyeing the water in the toilet tank, either with a few drops of food coloring or a dye tablet provided as part of a leak detection kit, available from your hardware store or water provider. After dyeing the water, wait 20 minutes or so and check the water in the toilet bowl. If it is still clear, then no water has leaked from the tank. If it has even a tinge of color, then your toilet has a leak. Sometimes, if you have a very bad leak, the toilet will flush by itself, and there may be no color visible in either the bowl or the tank.
While there are several possible causes, by far the most common source of leak is the valve that controls the release of water from the tank to the bowl. In most toilets, this is a rubber flapper valve. Depending on water quality and whether you use a toilet bowl cleaner in the tank, these flaps may last from 2 to 7 years.
Replacing a flapper valve is not difficult. For detailed instruction, see www.toiletology.com
Replacement flapper valves are not expensive, running from $3 to $10, but they come in a bewildering array of slightly different shapes and designs. When you go to the hardware or home improvement store to get a replacement flapper, take the old one with you. Some flappers are early-close flappers required by ULF toilets. Replacing an early close flapper with a standard one will result in large amounts of water being wasted. Conversely, replacing a standard flapper with an early-close one may result in the toilet not clearing waste from the bowl.
If you do use an in-tank toilet cleaning product that contains chlorine or other harsh chemicals, consider spending a little extra for a flapper valve made of composite rubbers that are more resistant to these chemicals.
INSTALLING AN IN-TANK TOILET RETROFIT DEVICEIn the U.S., approximately 40 percent of all domestic water consumed is flushed down the toilet. One person using an older 5.5 gallon flush toilet will use 13,000 gallons of fresh water per year to dispose of 165 gallons of body waste. For this reason, a bewildering array of retrofit devices has been developed to allow older toilets to operate on less water.
Since all water from the toilet goes directly into the sewer or septic tank, saving water used by toilets reduces both consumption and wastewater flows. Hydraulic overload is the single most common cause of on-site wastewater treatment failure. Surface ponding and backup can often be eliminated by retrofitting with efficient toilets and showerheads.
The most common approach to retrofitting older toilets is installing a displacement device. Toilet displacement devices are used primarily on non-conserving toilets in order to reduce the volume of water used each time the toilet is flushed. Typical displacement devices may include bricks, plastic bottles, or plastic bags. Lighter items must be weight loaded in order to insure their stability.
If a brick is used, make sure to wrap it in a plastic wrap, or place it into a small garbage bag before placing it into the tank. Some bricks may deteriorate slightly if constantly in water and cause damage to the flushing mechanisms.
These types of displacement devices are simply placed into the tank in places in which they do not interfere with the function of the flushing mechanisms. The volume, which they occupy, will be saved each time the toilet is flushed.
Devices of this type can reduce the amount of fresh water used by about 4.2 gallons per toilet per day. The use of these devices can reduce water consumption by about 13% from that which would have been used if the volume displacement devices were not in place.
Toilet displacement dams are devices, which, unlike the volume displacement devices, reduce the amount of water available per flush by holding a small amount of water out of use. The dams usually consist of two pieces of flexible plastic that are wedged into the tank on either side of the flush valve and act like dams. Water held back by the dams is not able to be used and thus saved each time the toilet is flushed.
Tank dams save approximately 6 gallons per toilet per day, which amounts to a water savings of greater than 18%, when compared to the traditional non-conserving toilet. Another advantage of tank dams over displacement devices is that they are less likely to move around in the tank or otherwise interfere with the flush mechanism. Their price is somewhat higher, though.
Yet another retrofit approach is the early-close flapper. This device replaces the standard flapper valve and is designed to shut sooner, before all the water in the toilet tank can flow into the toilet bowl. Early-close flappers often are adjustable, so that the homeowner can find a good balance between saving water and having the toilet bowl reliably cleared.
PURCHASING A ULF TOILETIn the U.S., approximately 40 percent of all domestic water consumed is flushed down the toilet. One person using an older 5.5 gallon flush toilet will use 13,000 gallons of fresh water per year to dispose of 165 gallons of body waste. For this reason, 1.6-gallon ultra-low flush (ULF) toilets are now required on new construction nationwide. Because the useful life of a toilet is measured in decades, older 3.5 gallon and 5.5 gallon models still constitute a majority of the toilets in use. Replacing an older toilet with a 1.6 gallon model can significantly reduce water demand and stress on sewer systems. Thus, many water providers offer inducements to replace older toilets.
Since all water from the toilet goes directly into the sewer or septic tank, water saving toilets reduce both consumption and wastewater flows. Hydraulic overload is the single most common cause of on-site wastewater treatment failure. Surface ponding and backup can often be eliminated by retrofitting with efficient toilets and showerheads.
Toilet manufacturers now make a large variety of ULF toilets that use 0.7 to 1.6 gallons per flush. These toilets rely on various mechanisms to accomplish their job with less water.
One variety of an toilet. The line pressure of water entering the toilet co ULF toilet is the pressurized tankmpresses trapped air within the sealed tank, until air pressure equals water pressure. When the toilet is flushed, the pressure of the compressed air reinforces the normal gravity flow. Because of this increase in pressure, 1.5 gallons or less can clean the standard bowl, instead of 3.5 or 5.5 gallons.
Other models of ULF toilets use early-close flapper valves to shut off flow between the toilet tank and bowl before the tank is fully drained. These toilets closely resemble older models in appearance and design, and often cost less than other models. One serious drawback, however, is that when the flapper valve inevitably wears out and begins to leak, the homeowner may not be able to find the correct early-close replacement valve. Often, homeowners aren=t even aware that their toilets contain special flapper valves, and will inadvertently replace them with standard flapper valves. This results in a significant increase in water usage.
Still other ULF toilets rely on some sort of proprietary flush mechanism. Many of these toilets work just fine when new, but all have rubber or plastic parts that eventually wear out and need replacing. Often, the homeowner will be unable to find the necessary parts.
Many early ULF toilets were hastily designed and did not always work satisfactorily. Today, nearly all new ULF toilets are equal or superior to most conventional toilets in their ability to clean the bowl and move solids through sewers. The key is for consumers to determine what parts will require replacing over time, and to assure that they will be readily available.
