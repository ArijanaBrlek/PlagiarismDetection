All the electronic keyboards have the standard styles like Pop, Rock, Jazz, Latin, Foxtrots, Waltz, Swing, etc. and the more contemporary types like techno, house, jungle, Arabic, and Indian.
The accompaniment is actually a group of tracks playing various instruments. The tracks normally play the instruments like Drums, Bass, Piano or Guitar, Strings, woodwind, brass or any other melody instrument.
