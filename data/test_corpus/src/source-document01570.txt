(May 2008): Despite several thousand years of failure to correctly understand physical reality (hence the current ) it is actually very simple to work out how matter exists and moves about in Space. We just had to take and seriously and thus describe reality from only one substance existing, as wrote; i.e. While there are many minds and material things, they all exist in one common Space (just look around you and think about it). We can then show that the Wave Structure of Matter is the correct solution as it deduces the fundamentals of & perfectly (there are no opinions). I realise that there are a lot of 'crackpot' theories about truth and reality on the internet, but this solution is the most simple one and it is (though it takes time for our minds to adjust to new knowledge). - to try and describe an from the foundation of many discrete and separate things, matter 'particles', which then required forces / fields to connect them in space and time. This was always just a solution which never explained how matter was connected across the . For those who are , I think . He writes It is now obvious that discrete and separate 'particles' do not exist - that this harmony arises from a Wave Structure of Matter in Space (we are all interconnected in this space that we commonly experience). This underlying unity of reality (God, Brahman, Tao, Spirit, Energy, Light, Vibration) is central to all major world religions, thus their common as the other is part of the self. Clearly our world is in great trouble, heading rapidly towards self destruction due to human overpopulation and the resultant destruction of , and the pollution of air, land and water (over 80,000 man made chemicals contaminating everything we consume). The best solution to these problems is to rather than past myths and customs which invariably cause harm. I am not naive to the difficulties that humanity faces. But history shows that truth eventually triumphs, that there are enough sensible logical people in the world who appreciate the importance of truth. We are listed as one of the with around 500,000 page views each week, and rank in the top 20 in Google for many academic search terms - so we just need a bit of help to get in the top five (our aim). Given the (founded on the standard model / particle physics) the internet is clearly the best way to get new knowledge visible to the world. A world now in great need of wisdom from truth and reality. Sincerely, - - - - -
