What Causes the Brain's "Déjà vu" Experience?
Answer
The term déjà vu is originally France and its literal meaning is 'already seen'. In most handbooks on psychology, little or almost nothing is found on the phenomena but the book by Graham Reed is apparently the best reference: The Psychology of Anomalous Experience: A Cognitive Approach, Hutchinson University Library, London, 1972.
    Déjà vu is the sensation we have, when we feel that we have experienced or seen something before, but at the same time feel as if the experience was new. For this reason déjà vu disturbs the reality perception, as we have the feeling that the perception of some phenomena or circumstances is both present and past.
    Some epileptics seem to experience déjà vu more often than others do and some times the condition may last for several hours, or days. However, for most others this lasts only for a few seconds or minutes.
    Reeds explanations for déjà vu are as follows: When we experience some new circumstances as if we had gone through them before, we may conceivably be reliving same kind of emotional reactions to different circumstances. It is therefor the emotional response, which is of the same origin, but not necessarily the circumstance. It is thus because of the remembrance of the emotion that the perception of the environment appears to be the same.
    The other explanation for déjà vu is that when we experience something new as if it were familiar, then that is indeed the reality. We have already been in the same circumstances before but fail to recollect them precisely because the experience is fore some reason repressed, perhaps because it connects to unpleasant emotions. Therefore we perceive the experience as both new and familiar.
    It has been shown that the sensation of déjà vu can be produced through hypnosis. If a subject under hypnosis is shown a picture, which he is later asked to forget, he experiences the picture as strangely familiar when he is shown the picture again after having been awakened.
In the world literature there are known examples of some sort of déjà vu. The first volume of the masterpiece , or by the France author Marcel Proust (1871-1922) titled . In it is found a famous chapter where the taste of magdalene- cookies initially causes some sort of déjà vu and later succeeds in recreating a world that has disappeared, in the mind of the story's subject. The story's subject recalls the lost memories of youth when he tastes the cookies, which he had eaten in his youth and the aroma- and taste perception are thus the foundations of the memory. "But when the past has come to its end-- with man and mouse--it is the aroma and taste that remains. A memory of cookies, but more durable, aired, firmer, lasting - for a long time they continue as souls to recall, wait, hope, and on the wreckage of all the past, to carry on without collapsing, in all its pettiness, the gigantic structure of memory."À LA RECHERCHE DU TEMPS PERDUREMEMBRANCE OF  THINGS PAST)DE CÔTÉ DE CHEZ SWANN (SWANN’S WAY)
    If we put this into context with the theories of Reed, then Proust's interpretation of déjà vu are of the later variety, that is to say that the circumstances refer to real memories and events.
A known theory of the Greek philosopher Plato regarding memories is of similar nature as that of the recollections of Proust, except there it is maintained that what we remember is not only forgotten memories form this life but another previous life. To live and to learn thus becomes a remembrance of a previous life. Plato's teachings of on remembrance are in Greek named , and are one of Socrates' arguments for the immortality of the soul. This can be read in .ANAMNESISTHE LAST DAYS OF SOCRATES
    Finally it is fitting to remind of one poetic version of déjà vu. In the 1999 motion picture , the protagonist Neo experiences a déjà vu when he sees the same black cat twice consecutively within a extremely brief timespan. In the virtual reality where Neo and his companions are situated in, déjà vu is an indication that those who create the world are changing something. These are malfunctions of the system, which appear as something happening repeated precisely as before.THE MATRIX

"Does God play Dice with the Universe?"
After having been alerted to the page on the webs, the author of the became provoked enough to write this overview essay. This is integrated with the riddles of the syndrome, since the phenomena is possibly the most subtle of all the riddles of the human brain and , the most extreme one. It is further fitting for criticising the offerings of the learned academics of the , but the explanations offered on the university web made the author once more aware of the tragic poverty of the pseudo sciences of psychology and psychiatry. However, this is a part of the  humanity's overall general lack of insights and understanding of the fundaments of reality and consequently, the correct programs and the proper workings of the healthy human brain. This has resulted in our work with hypothetical models for this realm of the sciences and it is thus the argument of the author, that this has resulted in psychology and psychiatry hitherto caus- ing more harm than it does good.

    The web presentation is further a display of the general lack of adherence by these disciplines to the scientific methodology, since it is taking samples from, and is drawing parallels to, in literature. The author recalls that his foremost psycho-biology teacher, , did make himself guilty of this manoeuvre in his 1984 book, , where he made reference to, . However, in this he was not connecting it to, or arranging it into any unscientific fantasy explanations for the phenomena, but using it as a pseudo verification of association between the senses and memory. The rest of the two suggested explanations in the article are in line with this approach and it is the same problem as always; No causative answers, only the action descriptive . This has its causes in the fundamental fact that our brains are reality-machines and that the fundaments of reality are quantum mechanical ones, which is not generally appreciated or understood. This is the reason why the pseudo sciences of psychology and psychiatry are still just that: . For verification of this, we need go no further than the current news on the tragedy of ."Apallo University""fictions"Professor Richard M.

    The story begins when, on the occasion of the internment of in Wakefield prison in June 2003, the British television station reported on the case. In order to explain to the public why a human being, who had made it his calling to help his suffering fellows--by becoming a doctor of medicine--could become a mass murderer. For this end the managers of brought in a psychiatrist for the purpose of explaining why this happened, that a medical doctor had become a mass murderer. ( for those who are not familiar with the terms psychologist and psychiatrist: The main difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist is that the psychiatrist is a doctor of medicine, who has learned psychology and is allowed to drug people, but can cure no one, were as the psychologist has not learned medicine and has therefore to call up his psychiatrist friend when he wants to put his client on drugs.)ShipmannSKYSKYNote
    In his explanation, the orderd psychiatrist began by telling the public that: . The psychiatrist did not bother to explain to the public that the term was only a descriptive term for specific behavior and did not reflect any causes. This simply because it is not know in the neuro-sciences what it is that produces a , much the less what the malfunctioning mechanism in the brain is that causes this. The same is true for the addiction malfunctions of the human brain--their mechanism is not known--so had the psychiatrist that appeared on the been truthful, he would have told the public: We simply do not know! However, this he did not do and the brain-functions mechanical causes for the arrogant denial behind HIS behavior, are not known either. In other words, the explanation offered was no explanation--just a play with words. No wonder that the journalists, are now, on the occasion of suicide, are remarking: This is an absence of the realization that even if had lived, he would not have been able to tell why he did this. He himself would not have known the answer.SKY"It is not because Dr. Shipman is a drug addict that he had murdered his patients. It is because he is a psychopath""psychopath""psychopath"SKY-TVSKYShipman's"Now we will never know why he did this, since he is dead!"Shipman
    The real tragedy of this affair is not just in this lack of insights and knowledge of the malfunctions of the human brain that produce this. The real tragedy of this is that the imperfect and defective pseudo science of psychology and psychiatry will continue to be taught in our Universities and to produce academic experts who will continue to produce their useless labels on malfunctioning brains. Most of us are not even aware of the fact that the foundations for the pseudo science of psychology and psychiatry were laid by an active alcohol and drug addict and that this is still being denied by the professors that teach these disciplines. This is the most serious error and falsification of science in humanity, since our failure to understand the faulty mechanism in the addictions, represents our lack of understanding of the most widely spread and serious of all the brains malfunctions. In essence it means that we do not have the ultimate explanations for the construction and functions for the human brain; healthy og sick. This is what the suggests is the reason for the failure of science to solve the riddles of the human brain.QF-theory
    This is then the cause for the lack of conscious awareness and our self-delusions that produce such meaningless explanations as the labels of the pseudo science of psychology and psychiatry. Meaningless, since they are not founded in a fundamental understanding of the functions of a healthy human brain, which is not known. The tragedy is that these labels, at best, only serve to "park" the individuals with defective brains, in psychiatric asylums or in the stupor of drugs, but the problems will continue, grow and produce increasingly such extreme cases the Harold Shipmans and we shall continue to be without means of detecting them before they commit their senseless acts. All we can do in the case they are apprehended, after they have committed their acts, is to exclaim; and then turn them over to the psychiatrists for further drugging. However, the Hitlers, the Stalins, the Shipmans are only the individuals, which we pay attention to because of their grand efficiency, forgetting that we are only a hairs with from being just like them. We entirely miss noticing the millions of ordinary humans who are in denial and who are killing themselves and those around them, just with their pathological behavior, for whose causes no one has conclusive explanations."This is the best we got!
    The reason for the murders of is of course in his drug addiction. This has now been made possible to be understood, by the for the human brain, in the quantum mechanical , which was introduced in 1998 and published in 2002. It shows how the malfunction condition, that produce the is created by the failure of the neuro-transmitter re-uptake, while the neurons are contaminated by chemicals that replace the natural ones, primarily alcohol and drugs (how it is carried through the genes and transmitted to others) and then how the altered consciousness-neuron interaction produce the brain-programs that are responsible for the thinking that kills. It shows in details how failed re-uptake, produces what the theory calls the , but this is what neurology calls functional malfunctions or disorders of the brain.Harold Shipman MD"cracking of the code"QF-THEORY"psychopath""filter"

This means that if this is true, then the should have the fundamental insights into the human brain and its programs, and should therefore be able to provide us with the missing answers regarding its functions and malfunctions. This of course includes the experience, which so mystifies and fascinates everybody. However, the does not deal with the brains centers (Seen before.), separate from the centers.

    This discussion on the question of the experience, has initially to be in arbitrary terms and it begins by the fundamental for the human brain's DNA. There the suggests that the and centers should be situated in the spatial hemispheric temporal lobe, which in turn accounts for the epileptics being more prone to experience. This is also born out by the experiments carried out byduring the mid-twentieth century. The then suggests that the center is the brain's , but this is born out by the research experiments carried out by in the last decades of the twentieth century. The thus proposes to show that the mysterious brain faculty is natural to us, and not some sort of an evolutionary creation--through some forms of spiritual masturbation--as suggested by (ZUKUNFT EINER ILLUSION) and (THE BLIND WATCHMAKER).Déjà vuQF-programQF-theoryDéjà vuJamais vuDéjà vuWilder Penfield MDQF-theoryJamais vufaith facultyProfessor Michael PersingerQF-theoryJamais vuDr. Sigmund FreudProfessor Richard Dawkins
    The phenomena in realty, in Nature--external of the brain--that corresponds to the and the centers, are the two, and poles in the zero-energy field of the vacuum. These are the same poles that light dances in and make a simple gadget like Polaroid glasses work. They are at the same time the reality-dimension out of which all the matter in the Universe has issued or sprung from; as the Harvard physicist, , describes it. This is the reason for the brain's , which are at the same time the bain's, being situated in the spatial hemisphere, just as the two are in space. Further, the show that these two poles have an extended correspondence into the and wave functions in every atom, every cell, of our body and produce the brain's and the centers. It is the extended effects of these waves in the matter/energy particles that produce the gravitational effect in space. They form the gravitons. In a perfectly healthy brain, free of all quantum functional displacements, they not only extend into every DNA, but throughout the electromagnetic field of consciousness. In this are to be found the explanations for the extraordinary perception experiences of man. Fundamentally, in the material reality, these two and two gravitational functions have the effect of producing momentum that brings objects together.Jamais vuDéjà vuV-negativeV-positive"The only free lunch ever!"Professor Sidney Sheldonfaith and creativity facultiescompassion facultiesV-polesQF-paradigm for the brainW-negativeW-positiveJamais vuDéjà vuALLV-polesW-waves
    In the biological reality the extended function of the centers serves to bring species together for procreation and enhanced collective survivability, but that is the function of the brains center (spatial hemispheric temporal lobe), which was mention before as of the human brain. It is the of our brains. It is the faculty through which we recognize and care for each other, for if recognize , can have a more meaningful and compassionate interaction with , which in turn increases my survivability.Déjà vuDéjà vu"the compassion faculty"WE facultyIyouIyou
   When the faculty of the centers, or the of the brain fails compleatly, the unfortunate individual becomes , which is like most everything concerning the brain's fundamental programming, not known in science. The failure of theDéjà vu"compassion faculty"autisticDéjà vu centers programmingis progressive at different rates and in a small number of cases may progress into changing the programming in theJamais vucenters in an extremely unusual manner that produces theautistic savant, or an autistic individual with extremely unusual abilities, usually in just one field.
    The then offers us an even greater insight into the and the centers faculty functions by showing us why people have such varied disposition towards faith, or the ability to believe in God or a Higher Power. Why people have sudden when these faculties suddenly start working properly, or why not all of those tested, react to excitatory magnetic waves application to the spatial temporal lobe. It is further the collective stages of failure in these two brain centers, that produce the phenomena of the and also explains the fact that only about one third of those given placebos react in a positive manner them. Finally, the shows us why the centers faculties are associated with all and in humans and what their causes are. All these malfunction are caused by what the describes as the in the and they are created by the in the neuronal synaptic exchanges. What has made this so hard for science to detect is the fact that thisQF-theoryJamais vuDéjà vu"spiritual or quantum change experiences""Asymmetry of the Human Brain"QF-theoryJamais vuepilepticpsychiatric disordersQF-theory"functional disorder filter"DNA's-neuronal introns"failed re-uptake""filter"is also inherited in accord- ance with the Mendelian laws of genetic inheritance.
    The association of the experience to the brain's memory functions in the web side , is also situated in the none-scientific methodological boondocks of the pseudo sciences of psychology and psychiatry. Mythology makes more sense than these pseudo sciences. Here again, this is understandable since our sciences simply do not have the correct fundamental models for the construction and functions of the human brain. This applies to the reasons for the common misconceptions and speculative conjectures made in the article regarding the function of memory.Déjà vu"Apallo University""Déjà vu article"
    If in fact the is , then it follows that it should be able to answer the questions regarding the relationship of to the experience. This is where the whole of the foundations of the neuro-sciences ideas about memory start to shake as in a 7-Richter tremor and this is not talking about DTs. An attempt at considering the question regarding the functions of memory, without knowing conclusively in what the brain's thought process is founded, or without any fundamental model for thought, that is still in the none-scientific methodological boondocks. With the advantages of being in the possession of the , it becomes clear that the current suggestions of the neuro-sciences, that the thinking is in the neuronal discharge-firing, is the main prevailing error that keeps humanity in the dark about the brain.

    To enter this domain in the brain functions we are forced to go back to the old arguments of Bohr and Einstein. Here for the regarding the question whether the current quantum theory description of quantum reality, is all here, or whether something is still missing.

    Here following are three quotations regarding the question of the completeness of Quantum Mechanics, but the first two come from the late in 1982: " andProfessor Heinz R. PagelsThe remarkable feature of all the leptons is that they have never revealed any interior structure. They appear to be pure point particles even at the highest energies. This suggests they are truly elementary and not composite particles--a rock bottom to the levels of matter, a feature which compounds the puzzle of the leptons.""We can imagine that quantum reality is like a sealed box out of which we receive messages. We can ask questions about the contents of the box but never actually see what is inside. The principle of complementarity asserts that in describing reality we must invoke complementarity concepts that exclude each other--they cannot both be true. The road to quantum reality may go on far into the future of physics, and new insights may be found. Perhaps quantum theory is experimentally wrong or incomplete, something that is not logically impossible."
    The second one comes from the physicist in 1990, but she is married to a psychiatrist:Dr. Danah Zohar"At times, quantum theory seems to serve as a useful metaphor which helps to draw these reflections into a new and sharper focus, while at others it seems to promise at least a partial explanation for how consciousness, and hence daily experience, might actually work…Quantum physics shows us that we cannot separate ourselves from our environment… The full nature of quantum indeterminism goes straight to the heart of the central philosophical problem raised by quantum mechanics--the nature of reality itself… My own guess, where I to speculate at all about the death of Schrödinger's cat,, would be in sympathy with that of the physicists who suggest there is noting paradoxical about reality itself, but rather something wrong-or at least incomplete-about quantum theory. In its present form, since it can't account for whatever it is about observation that collapses the wave function, it simply cant' apply to the whole of physical reality…We need some further mathematics, they argue, perhaps even the discovery of whole new physical principles before we can understand the translation from the quantum world to our own."
 
This is precisely the case with the , which states unequivocally that the are not complete. There are two most important discoveries in the improvements of the that offer fundamentally new ways of looking at the human brain. This it where the provides us with the brain's fundamental reality program, or that of and by this solves numerous riddles regarding the brain. Of these the most important is the insight into the fundamental two-dimensional reality of the DNA, or that of the and the nucleic acid bases, where the represent the and the the . At the same time it solves another major riddle, possibly the most fundamental enigma of them all. This is the riddle of the brain's wave of consciousness, which is a electromagnetic field.QF-theoryQuantum MechanicsQF-modelQuantum TheoryQF-theory"The Quantum Wave of the Universe"exonintronexons"explicate reality"introns"implicate reality""semi standing"
    According to quantum mechanics, then all fields of energy have their specific quanta. Here the quanta for the electromagnetic field is the photon, which in quantum theory has been shown to have its and its , but the suggests that this represents a twofold reality of a twofold wave property. One wave function for the matter side that is constantly waving and at the same time another wave function for the antimatter side that is constantly waving . The physicist and mathematician, has presented mathematical proof showing such quantum wave action possible. The main consequence of this is the powerful suggestion that the phenomenon of thought is actually in the quantum wave of consciousness and not in the firing of the neurons, which is a secondary neurotransmitter exchange action for the collective adjustment of the reality perception. A continuation of this explanation is the illumination of how it is possible for the wave of consciousness to retrieve information out of the DNA - (-) intra somatic realties and discharge them through speech or other means. At the same time the wave of consciousness is loading into the DNA - (-) intra somatic realties, information in the form of long term memory quanta."matter side""antimatter side"QF-theory"out from a center" (explicate)"in to a center" (implicate)Profesor Eduard Witten"consequential"exonintronexplicateimplicateexonintronexplicateimplicate
    It is thus the quantum wave of consciousness--which makes one holistic reality out of the 24 to 30.000.000.000 neurons in the brain's seat of consciousness--that represents the thought, and this flow is regulated through the hypocapuses by the neuronal and programs of the DNA. It is in this control that the loading into the DNA - (-) intra somatic realties, of information in the form of long term memory quanta temporary, occasionally fails in the drunk-state and drug withdrawals and produces the temporary black-out experience in memory. This is born-out by the case of the permanent blackout of US marine soldier who was cut in the hypocapus, while partaking in recreational fencing aboard an aircraft carrier.exonintronexonintronexplicateimplicate
    What has made it so hard for science to crack the code for the human brain, is the fact that it is a holistic reality construction. This fact is creating the extra dimensions in the differential equations of the mathematics of our physicists. It becomes even more difficult to understand when it comes to the memory quanta, which according to the is a holistically modulated photon quanta, retained in the of the DNA's nucleotide bases.QF-theory"atomic orbits"
    Good! Here is the light at the end of the tunnel, even though it appears as just another lack of adherence to the scientific method, as the pseudo sciences of psychology and psychiatry speculations on the experience. However, this is not the case. This is a finding of a hypothetical experiment, which took place in reality and where the author of this essay was the , in a process where he came within a hairs-with of loosing his life, due to his arrogant denial of the existence of the faith faculties in our brains."Apallo University"Déjà vu"experimental subject"
    During the last two years of the authors addiction progression, he had ever more numerous episodes of experiences, in particular in the last two months. He has also had verifications by several other addicts through the years, that they experienced the same.
