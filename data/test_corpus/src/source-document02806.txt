Characteristics of Mountain Lion Home Ranges in Big Bend Ranch State Park
by Gilbert Guzman, Mike Pittman (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department) and Louis A. Harveson
Twenty-one mountain lions () were captured on Big Bend Ranch State Park, Jan. 22, 1993, through March 28, 1996, using leghold snares and trained hounds. Captured mountain lions were examined, aged and a series of morphological measurements were recorded.concolor
Sixteen mountain lions were fixed with radio transmitters operating on specific frequencies. Radio-collared mountain lions were monitored from the ground and fixed-wing aircraft.
A total of 711 locations was recorded for 10 male and five female mountain lions. Home ranges were delineated for six male and five female mountain lions. Average annual ranges (100 percent minimum convex polygon) for adult male mountain lions (348.6 km) were larger (P <0.05) than for adult female mountain lions (205.9 km).22
Average percent overlap (100 percent minimum convex polygon) of annual female-female, male-male, and female-male mountain lion ranges were 26.1, 22.9 and 28.9, respectively. Annual shifts were apparent (P < 0.05) for female mountain lions and for the cumulative male mountain lion ranges.
Mountain lion density (No./100 km) ranged from 0.26-0.59. Mountain lion mortalities were attributed to predator control practices on private land (n = 15), hunting (n = 1) and other causes (n = 3) on the study area.2
The mountain lion population level on BBRSP was limited by high mortality rates of female and male mountain lions.
