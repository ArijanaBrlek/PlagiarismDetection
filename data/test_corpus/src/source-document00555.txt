As a building material, PVC is low cost, durable, and easy to assemble. In recent years, PVC has been replacing traditional building materials such as wood, concrete and clay in many areas. When it comes to fencing, wood or metal have typically been king, but now there are some great and extremely affordable composite alternatives to wood and metal. One of the most durable and affordable alternatives to expensive, high-maintenance wood and metal, or to other composites, is PVC vinyl fencing. Due to its beautiful looks, durability, lack of maintenance and affordability, over the past 15 years vinyl fencing has become the fastest growing part of the fencing industry. PVC has come a long way since the days of simple round white tubes, and is now used for much more than just plumbing and patio furniture. Now, over 50% of the PVC made today is used as construction material to replace wood, and sometimes metal, and is used to build the beautiful fence around the patio too! PVC vinyl fencing comes fabricated to look just like real wood, white wood, or gloss white metal. Even up very close, it is very hard to tell vinyl fencing from its wood or metal counterparts. There are also the many traditional styles to choose from as far as the design of your fence. You can get traditional and classic looking (such as Cape Cod) picket fencing, privacy fencing, contemporary looking pool fencing and post and rail fencing, that all look stunning. They can come in either a gloss white wood or metal look, or a real wood look. Because it is virtually maintenance-free and will last for the life of the home, over the past 15 years vinyl fencing has quickly become the fencing of choice for many homeowners. Since there are no expensive wood treatments, no painting, no sanding, no replacement of cracked, broken and rotted boards, in fact, no maintenance at all, it has also become preferred with community associations and commercial developments that need to install and maintain large runs of fencing. Even large ranches are now converting to it. Because it is a vinyl material, the color goes all the way through each piece, so scratches will not show, and it will never weather, rot, crack, warp or chip. Also, it is UV protected so the color will never dull or fade. Because of its strength and durability, the upfront costs of buying and installing vinyl fencing can sometimes be slightly higher than the traditional materials like wood or metal. But vinyl fencing typically comes with a lifetime warranty, and the cost of maintaining it is zero for the life of the fence, so the slightly higher upfront cost is offset many times over by the long-term savings in maintenance.
