Do you live in northern New Jersey and do you want to play lots of tennis?
This is a social group designed to bring together recreational tennis players of various levels (including beginners) who want to find partners to play with and socialize with other tennis players. We will have regular meetings to practice on public tennis courts after work and on weekends. We will also have occasionally social events. Please, take advantage of the message board or email group members directly to find tennis partners.
We will have meetings to play tennis on public courts. In the summer, the plan is to meet twice per week (on week night and on a weekend) weather permitting. In the winter, we will have to use one of the very few inexpensive indoor courts, so we will meet less often.
Also, if you have ideas for some tennis related (or just general sports/fitness/social) activities and want to volunteer to organize it, please let me know and I can put it up on the meetup calendar.
