SIC's Expertise Prevents Potential Problems
Problematic Coordinates for Vector and Well Data Displayed on Satellite Image
Orthorectified IKONOS
The expertise and accuracy of our services associated with GIS projects. Some GIS projects are hampered by coordinate problems of different image and vector data layers, which are caused by one or a combination of the following:precludes nearly all potential problems
Improper of satellite or aerial image mosaics orthorectification
Poor quality GPS derived ground control points (GCPs)
Improper rectification of digital source raster maps
Importation of or shape files for source data with incorrect coordinates vector data
Improper use of units or unit convergence factors for source data
Utilization of source data from a corrupt coordinate database
Our imaging, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and geodesy experts are experienced in , and supplementing satellite images and imaging data. These projects provide invaluable information to a broad spectrum of industries. extraction manipulating
GIS â€” Geographic Information System
Today there are thousands of geospatial in use. Organizations, agencies and companies throughout the world are using the technology to transform manually produced maps and associated descriptive records into powerful digital databases. Once a tool that was affordable only to the largest organizations, geospatial systems have become a cost-effective option for even the smallest organizations. applications
Geographic information system technology is widely used for scientific investigations, natural resource management such as , , , and , , , , , and . forestry agriculture mining oil and gas exploration environmental impact assessment urban planning natural hazards land cover and change detection law enforcement cadastre habitat mapping
The key advantage to GIS is the ability to share maps. State and federal agencies, along with utility companies, which create their own respective maps, can, for example, share maps with each other. This not only saves money, but provides the ability to create hundreds of new maps, many of which never existed before, for minimal cost.
