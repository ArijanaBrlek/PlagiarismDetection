EW Scripps is Splitting
October 16th, 2007
This morning I woke up, checked my blackberry and saw an email from our President and CEO entitled I figured we bought a new company or something. Not so much…Important Company Announcement
This morning it was announced that the board of directors are pursuing a plan to separate the company into two publicly traded entities.
I am part of the newspaper division so we will now be grouped with Broadcast and classified as The E.W. Scripps Company while the networks and shopzilla, uswitch will be under a new company named Scripps Networks Interactive.
With any new change you always have initial concerns etc.. but I don’t really see this being a bad thing; and even if I did do you think I’d post it here?
The KnoxNews (one of our newspapers) has more on the Scripps company split
