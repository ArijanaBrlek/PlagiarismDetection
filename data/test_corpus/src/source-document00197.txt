Hang Out to Dry
This is another favorite wedding shower game. Upon arrival each guest is given a clothespin and told there are two words that are not to be mentioned. For instance, Wedding and the grooms name. If a guest is caught saying one of these words, the person who caught the gaffe gets her clothespin. At the end of the day, the guest with the most clothespins wins.

Whats in Your Purse?
Before the party, the hostess should make a list of items commonly found in a womans purse, and maybe some not so common items as well. As she goes down the list and calls out each item, guests will look in their purses to see if they have the same. Each matching item gets a point and the most points wins a prize.

Bridal Bingo
Instead of numbers, Bingo cards are made using common bridal shower gifts. As each gift is opened, guests mark an X on their cards for matching items. Bingo wins the prize.

When to Play Games
Since a bridal shower game is to help the guests get to know each other and set the tone for the event, its best to schedule it before the gifts are to be opened. Since guests arrive 30 to 60 minutes before the bride, you might want to schedule an ice breaking bridal shower game before the bride arrives. By the time the guest of honor is in attendance, everyone will be communicating like old friends.
