Spy Sweeper
It’s time for me to remind you that when it comes to computer technology I know next to nothing. There are two ways that I make decisions about what technology I can and should use. First, I listen to people around me that I trust. I read your blogs. I go to the websites you recommend. I hang out in forums with smart people who understand things that I need to know. I ask a lot of questions. Secondly, I turn to trusted sources to see what their opinions are. Today I was asked to review and I took advantage of their offer to download a free trial of their software. I haven’t had a chance yet to ask for your opinion, so I went to my second line of investigation. What did I discover? Spy Sweeper Spy Sweeper

I’ve been using a freebie spyware program for a couple of years. Every time I run it, it leaves me with a warning about “threats” it couldn’t remove. I just ran Spy Sweeper and, for the first time, I don’t have that anxiety of thinking that I’ve left my computer unprotected. Why? Because Spy Sweeper completely cleaned my computer of spyware and its Smart Shields will detect and block even brand new threats. Regular automatic updates will insure that I have the full advantage of their constantly expanding spyware definition database. You don’t have to take my word for it. Check out their site. Download the free trial version, and check out their awards page while you’re there. Find out why Spy Sweeper is the most award-winning spyware removal software you can install on your own computer.
