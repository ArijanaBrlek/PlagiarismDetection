Henna Dragon Tattoo - Vixn's Body Art
I can be found at a 4 or 5 different festivals in the Okanogan and Kootenays over the summer and like to meet with clients at my house, their house or at local parks for that one on one personal touch. I have always enjoyed the way henna allows you to mark a persons body (temporarily) to show off a more beautiful side of life.   E-Mail:

This book includes dragon lore from many countries as well as a structural analysis of dragon anatomy as it has evolved throughout history.

 This is one of the best dragon books I have ever purchased or seen. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every page. It gave detailed information on drawings as well as some wonderful background history that was very thought provoking. My whole family enjoyed this book and it has been passed around to my friends as well. It is well worth the investment and will be a valuable asset to my strained glass craft projects. Read more
For many centuries that the dragon has been the symbol of China, and has been considered as immortal and omnipresent ever since ancient times. It has belonged to the people, and it has also been the symbol of monarchy and supreme power. The dragon was a mythical beast. It was a concept. But most Chinese people, indeed most Asian people, were convinced that it existed. There are many occasions when there were claims that it had been seen, even as recently as 1920. No other creature in the world could have produced such a far-reaching influence on the mind of man.
Unlike the European dragon, it was considered a beneficent beast, until the Buddhists introduced the concept of evil dragons. Yet the basic belief was always that it had noble spiritual qualities that were unconquerable.
 This book has been written by an author who has lived for many years in China researching into its history. It is in an easy-to-read style and is dedicated to the dragon and its many offshoots and variations. The pictures are delightful. It gives details of what a dragon was, where it was used, and what it was called. The reader will become more acquainted with the dragon, and will gain a greater understanding of this magnificent beast. It will interest and please the serious student and the enthusiastic Chinaphile alike. Read more
This is the kind of book you leave on a coffee table for visitors to peruse. It has beautiful large color plates of dragons on every left-side page and amusing anecdotes on each facing page. The author is presuming to be an authority on "the discovery of dragons" and in a tongue-in-cheek narrative is trying to professionally prove the disclaimers of his "one time colleague Marty Fibblewitz" who has now "chosen to side with the doubters." THE DISCOVERY OF DRAGONS is divided into three sections of nine pages each: The Discovery of European Dragons, The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, and The Discovery of Tropical Dragons. The first page of each section is an introduction to the section that describes the distinctive qualities of the dragons of said region, introduces the adventurer who discovered those dragons, and throws pot-shots at 'Professor' Fibblewitz. The following eight pages of each subsection show the author's 'proof' of these discoveries. European dragons, says the author, were discovered by Bjorn of Bromme, Viking, from A.D. 856 through A.D. 863. He discovered Great Snow Dragons in Greenland, an Emerald Dragon in Ireland, a Welsh Red Dragon sleeping on a horde of treasure, and the St. George Dragon (yes, that very same dragon). The author's proof comes in the way of letters found, scrawled penmanship on linen to his cousin Olaf back in Norway (who seems to be having his own problems Rampaging the countryside). In The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, we meet heroine Soong Mei Ying, faithful daughter of a thirteenth-century Chinese Silk trader, who--while taking her ailing father's silks to a far away market--discovers a pair of Mongolian Screamers, a Japanese Butterfly Lizard with medicinal qualities, and Eastern Temple Worm, and a Great Golden Worm. Now, the Letters of Dr. E.F. Liebermann in The Discovery of Tropical Dragons might be just a tad funnier than those of Bjorn of Bromme (it's a close tie, actually). Dr. Liebermann went to Africa in 1847 searching for the African Frilled Frog. He never finds this frog, but along the way he discovers four kinds of dragon (Livingstone's Demon, the Crested Dipper, a monstrous Common Green Draak, and several deadly Spotted Marsh Draaks). He also invents the typewriter and figures out the theory of continental drift. This is an adorable book! Each section has its own style, and the characters--illuminated by their letters home--are unique individuals with great quirks. Each page is laden with tiny details that enthralled this reader. The letters home all have subtle changes as the adventurer passes from one discovery into the next--some of them quite hilarious. There's footnotes and maps and scale diagrams and miniature picture story reels across the bottom of each page . . . all done in glorious and changing detail work. But the best part are the dragon plates themselves: these large color paintings are gorgeous. THE DISCOVERY OF DRAGONS is a real winner, the perfect gift choice for a true dragon connoisseur.

If you ever encounter a dragon, it would be good to have this book on hand. Thanks to it, you will be able to recognize the particular species of the beast you have met, whether worm, basilisk, cockatrice, tarasque, peluda, or mere dragonet. Knowing such information could keep you from accidentally feeding a baby wyvern, as a girl named Maud did in Herefordshire, whereupon it grew into a winged monster that terrorized the countryside until it was finally dispatched by a fearless knight. Charmingly written and gorgeously illustrated with dragons ranging from Babylonian Ishtar's guard dragon as portrayed in mosaic bas-relief to Quetzalcoatl in Mayan codices to the creature Saint George famously fought, this is an excellent popular folklore tome. Patricia Monaghan Book Description For millennia, few animals have fascinated mankind more than dragons. But until now, no rigorous survey has captured them in all their glorious variety. Dragons: A Natural History is that survey...a one-of-a-kind book, bringing these captivating creatures to life with lavish illustrations and vivid commentary. This marvelous compendium will take you on a journey that begins with the earliest serpent dragons and continues to the present day. Along the way, Dr. Karl Shuker, one of the world's leading experts on dragonology , shares his wealth of knowledge on: Dragon dwellings: These magnificent beasts have been found in an astounding number of places. Dragons and their near relatives have found niches in every ecosystem on the planet -- from the mountains of Greece to the forests of northern Europe to the volcanic plain of Mesoamerica to the river valleys of China -- and have, as a consequence, become deeply embedded in human culture.   Dragon variety: Here are five main types of dragons, emerging from the floods or flames of history -- the frightening Serpents, Wyverns, and Classical Dragons of the West; the Sky Dragons, including beneficent Chinese Dragons, Amphipteres, and winged New World species; the Neo-Dragons such as the Basilisk, Salamander, and the like; as well as dozens of varieties and subspecies, including orms, guivres, lindorms, and more. Dragon traditions: From St. George's batwinged, scaly-legged adversary to Wagner's Fafnir to Quetzalcoatl, mythic dragons have been a powerful presence in the legends of humanity. Each of them is described and illustrated in Dragons: A Natural History.

Ever wonder why Smaug hoarded all that treasure? Apparently it was just to impress the lady dragons. That's only one detail of "Dr. Ernest Drake's Dragonology: The Complete Book of Dragons," a faux-scholarly book that gives intricate details to the legendary beasts. (The actual author is Dugald A. Steer). Without robbing dragons of their mystique, we get an overview of them: there are intricate studies of the different kinds of dragons, from the Eastern lung to the Australian marsupial (which is a bit too silly for the tongue-in-cheek tone of the book). "Dr. Drake" also examines their habits, such as courtship rituals and parenting, as well as the the biological means by which they spew flames, and the reason why they hoard gems. He also gives quite a bit of advice for the budding dragonolist, ranging from the obscure (hide shiny objects from baby dragons) to the ordinary (wear fireproof clothing). Finally, there is a historical overview of famous dragonologists from around the world, and spells that assist them. Dragons are a staple of legend and literature, although a neglected one. Though "Dragonology" is presented as a serious work, Steer never forgets to keep his tongue in cheek. It's a fun read, with lots of detail and thought -- after all, it can't be easy to document the physiology of a beast that doesn't, technically, exist. Taken on its own, the book might merely be cute. But Steer also includes little details like a faux library card belonging to Ernest Drake, a little letter enclosed in a special envelope, and an inscription on the inner front cover: "To Friendly Dragons" followed by a bunch of Tolkienesque runes. And the illustrations are as much a part as the faux-scholarly text. Classic-looking pictures of various kinds of dragons are only one part of it; there are also looks at embryonic dragons in the egg, the different egg shapes, a foldout map that shows where the various species live, and several pictures of the anatomy of dragons, including musculature, skeleton, and things like claws, wing "fingers" and optic nerves. Okay, maybe dragons don't exist. Big deal. The faux-scholarly tone, exquisite illustrations and intricate detail of "Dr. Ernest Drake's Dragonology: The Complete Book of Dragons" makes it an immensely fun read.

 Jane Yolen produces more great poetry and fiction in "Here There Be Dragons," part of her short story series focusing on ghosts, angels, witches, dragons, and so forth.
It starts off with "Why Dragons?", a poem about St. George, and proceeds to the highly original "Great-Grandfather Dragon's Tale," a story from the point of view of the dragons rather than the humans. There are two evocative little drabbles (stories under a hundred words), the saddening "Dragon Woke and Stretched" and the spellbinding "Sorry the Old Man Said." "Cockfight" is what later became the Pit Dragon trilogy, a story about a young boy on a poor planet which has dragons fighting for money. "Dragon Night" is a sweet little poem, a sort of dragon lullaby. "Dragon field" is a slightly less interesting story about an un heroic young man and a healer's daughter (and a dragon, of course).
"The King's Dragon" is the story of a member of the King's Dragoons, who has a slight problem when people keep hearing "dragoon" as "dragon." "Into the Wood" is pretty, if a little hard to understand. "Dragon's Boy," which later became a short children's novel, tells the story of the adolescent King Arthur and how he learned wisdom from a "dragon." "The Making of Dragons" is a thoroughly entertaining poem about how to construct a dragon. "One Ox, Two Ox, Three Ox, and the Dragon King" is the story of three boys called One Ox, Two Ox, Three Ox (I think their father had a screw loose), in a story partly influenced by Chinese legends. The collection ends with the wistful "Here There Be Dragons," a poem which harkens back to old maps with those words on them.
As in all of these books, Yolen includes comments and insights to the beginning of each story and poem, what caused her to write them and how they were influenced. David Wilgus's pencil drawings are realistic and soft-edged, very nice to look at and very appropriate to the contents.
A nice little collection for the dragon fanciers, much better than most story collections. Fans of Yolen's "Dragon's Boy" and "Pit Dragon" trilogy will undoubtedly enjoy this. Read more
