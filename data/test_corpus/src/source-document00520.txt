WorkPlace Scholarships: A High-Impact Opportunity
WorkPlace Scholarships are about one concept providing opportunities to allow people to help themselves and better provide for their families. WorkPlace Scholarships make this possible with privately-funded job training dollars for low-income people including low-wage workers, youth, individuals who have been laid off, and those who require job training but cannot afford to pay for it on their own. Many cannot access public funds, which are often depleted well before the need is satisfied. WorkPlace Scholarships are used for job training or retraining to get a job, earn more, or advance in the workplace.
The Need is Great
Why do we need WorkPlace Scholarships? Although The WorkPlace, Inc. receives public funding, there are not enough funds to support training for the all people in Southwestern Connecticut who need it. And, although the number of WorkPlace Scholarship contributors is increasing, the demand for job training in our region is increasing even faster. Simply put, we continue to have more skilled jobs than skilled people. This is due to two reasons: As the economy churns and more people are laid off, many of them need retraining or upgrading of skills to get back into the workforce. WorkPlace Scholarships can prepare them to re-enter the workforce with the skills they need to be successful. Additionally, we need to fill thousands of job openings due to retirements and growth, according to the Connecticut Department of Labor.Privately-funded WorkPlace Scholarships are critical and help supplement job training needs.
WorkPlace Scholarships are not a hand-out they provide individuals with opportunities to help themselves and move ahead. What better gift could a person receive than the chance to better support their family? Scholarships provide job training for adults and youth often living in our urban areas. Scholarship recipients include men, women, youth, and mature workers from all ethnic backgrounds. Specifically, WorkPlace Scholarship recipients include:
They may be unemployed or working part-time or full-time and need job training and education to obtain a job, increase wages, or advance in jobs. These families struggle as they live week to week or paycheck to paycheck;:People living on a low-income
These people may need retraining to re-enter the workforce. Whether it be technology training or training for a new profession, WorkPlace Scholarships are able to offer help. Families of dislocated workers must also survive on a limited income and deal with unusual financial stress, and they are eligible as well;People who have been laid off from their jobs:
 Youths who need job training and support services to learn about the world of work and secure jobs may also qualify, including high school drop-outs or parenting teens. With a Youth Scholarship, participants may enroll in an occupational skills training program which includes support services such as childcare and transportation.:Youth and Young Adults (ages 16-21)
