Our Voluntary Commitment
In 2000, the European PVC industry started a 10-year plan to enhance sustainability of its product and production over the full lifecycle. This means relentlessly improving production processes and products, investing in technology, minimising emissions and waste and boosting collection and recycling. 
The programme is based on the ‘Voluntary Commitment' signed by Vinyl 2010's . After publication, the Commitment received a wide range of comments during extensive public and political consultations, including from the European Commission's Directorate General Environment and Directorate General Enterprise. These led, in 2001, to a revised and expanded document. four member associations
The main commitments are:
Compliance with ECVM Charters on PVC production standards.
A plan for full replacement of lead stabilisers by 2015, in addition to the replacement of cadmium stabilisers that was achieved in March 2001.
The recycling by end 2010 of 200,000 tonnes/year of post-consumer PVC waste
The recycling of 50% of the collectable available PVC waste for windows profiles, pipes, fittings and roofing membranes in 2005, and flooring in 2008.
An R&D research and development programme on new recycling and recovery technologies, including feedstock recycling and solvent-based technology.
