The Fra Mauro map is unusual, but typical of Fra Mauro's , in that its orientation is with the south at the top, one of the usual conventions of Muslim maps, in contrast with the which has the north at the top. portolan charts Ptolemy map
Fra Mauro was aware of the Ptolemy map, and commented that it was insufficient for many parts of the world:
"I do not think it derogatory to Ptolemy if I do not follow his Cosmografia, because, to have observed his meridians or parallels or degrees, it would be necessary in respect to the setting out of the known parts of this circumference, to leave out many provinces not mentioned by Ptolemy. But principally in latitude, that is from south to north, he has much 'terra incognita', because in his time it was unknown." (Text from Fra Mauro map)
He recognized however the extent of the East given by , thereby suppressing the central position that had held on previous maps: Ptolemy Jerusalem
"Jerusalem is indeed the center of the inhabited world latitudinally, though longitudinally it is somewhat to the west, but since the western portion is more thickly populated by reason of Europe, therefore Jerusalem is also the center longitudinally if we regard not empty space but the density of population." (Text from Fra Mauro map)
Fra Mauro regarded the world as a sphere, although he used the convention of describing the continents surrounded by water within the shape of a disc, but had no certainty about the size of the Earth:
"Likewise I have found various opinions regarding this circumference, but it is not possible to verify them. It is said to be 22,500 or 24,000 or more, or less according to various considerations and opinions, but they are not of much authenticity, since they have not been tested." (Text from Fra Mauro map) miglia
The depiction of inhabited places and mountains, the map's is also an important feature. Castles and cities are identified by pictorial glyphs representing turreted castles or walled towns, distinguished in order of their importance. chorography

The description of is surprisingly accurate, especially in light of the fact that Portuguese explorers had not yet been beyond 12 degrees North at that date. Africa
Fra Mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the "Cape of Diab", describing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:
"Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India towards the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these people themselves, the ship went some 2,000 miles ahead until - once favourable conditions came to an end - it turned round and sailed back to Cape Diab in 70 days"
"The ships called junks (lit. "Zonchi") that navigate these seas carry four masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a , because they have an , who stands on the side and, with an in hand, gives orders to the navigator." (Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25.) compass astrologer astrolabe
Fra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from "a trustworthy source", who traveleled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer who happened to be in , at the time the expedition left: Niccol da Conti Calicut India
"What is more, I have spoken with a person worthy of trust, who says that he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the Cape of Soffala and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those, and that they had therefore sailed 4,000 miles"
Some of the islands named in the area of the southern tip of Africa bear Arabian and Indian names: ("celebration" in ), or ("fortunate" in .).Negila Arabic Mangula Sanskrit
Fra Mauro also comments that the account of this expedition, together with the relation by of the travels of from to through the southern Ocean in , led him to believe that the was not a closed sea and that could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11,G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.
