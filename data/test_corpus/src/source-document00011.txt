A word from our Founder
First of all, thank you so much for taking an interest in our gallery, and the artists that create such wonderful work for your enjoyment!
We represent our Artists for the "Love of Art"
For many years now, galleries have charged large percentages to show an artist's work.
Making art quite costly to both the artist and the consumer.
Also the cost of reproduction has evoled from being a costly process to a less expensive yet higher quality product.
Our partners such as have the same concept, it is the"artist" that should earn what is fair for their art.CaféPress™andImagekind™
The results are, affordable art for you the consumer and a fair price to the artist for their work.
For the first time in history a gallery is taking in less than the artist and we are proud to be such a support to our art community and world at large.
Art should be affordable yet well done and we are here to bring you the arts from the Caribbbean, starting with the infamous Rincon, PR.!
The worldwide mecca for surfing, the world's most beautiful sunsets, whale watching and now the "Arts" !
