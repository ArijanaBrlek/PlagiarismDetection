Lake Las Vegas Resort offers a new world of waterfront experiences.
By Candace Morrow
On the outskirts of the Las Vegas Strip resides the 3,592-acre Mediterranean-style Lake Las Vegas Resort, a privately-owned manmade lake in southeast Nevada. A resort and residential area in one, this retreat has a laid-back vibe when compared to Vegas fast-paced nightlife, but it still gives guests an eclectic atmosphere to explore. The resort includes everything from custom homes to exotic boating excursions to championship golf courses. For guests who have always wanted to travel overseas, Lake Las Vegas sets itself apart as a premier getaway reminiscent of Europes lakeside villages. European elements are sprinkled throughout the resorts lodging selection. Guests staying at the AAA Four Diamond-rated Ritz-Carlton will see traces of arched doorways and clay tile roofs. It consists of 349 guest rooms, which includes 35 suites, decorated in warm colors. Theres also a 30,000-square-foot spa and fitness center with 24 treatment rooms and a salon. Its signature piece is the three-story Florence-inspired Ponte Vecchio (meaning Old Bridge ) thats 375 feet long and hosts 65 club rooms and suites. Offering an unforgettable view of the resorts mountainous backdrop is the Loews Hotel, which is also AAA Four Diamond-rated. This hotel has a Moroccan feel in each of its 493 guest rooms and suites, which are accented with heavy hues and hand-painted artwork. However, there are contemporary features such as executive desks, floor lamps and high-speed Internet access. There are plenty of on-water and waterfront activities. Lake Mead, one of the largest national recreational sites in the United States, is only two miles away and offers scenic power-boating and watersports opportunities. Within the resort, the 320-acre lake only allows non-motorized recreational watercraft  with the exception of the resorts two cruise yachts and safety vehicles  but visitors can select from paddle boating, kayaking, canoeing, sailboating or fishing at Lake Las Vegas two marinas, MonteLago Village Marina and SouthShore Marina. For fly-fishermen, the lake overflows with trout, bluegill, bonefish, bass and sunfish, and master guides even offer programs and lessons for both new and veteran fishers. Romantics can float across the lake on the popular Italian gondolas while sipping champagne as a gondolier navigates the waters. Other activities include stargazing, guided hikes and walks, and mountain biking. Helicopter tours to the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam and Lake Mead are also available. Golfers will find Lake Las Vegas to be the ultimate golfing gold mine with three 18-hole courses collectively named the Best Resort Golf Courses by Golfweek magazine in 2007: the Reflection Bay and SouthShore Golf Clubs  both designed by Jack Nicklaus  and The Falls Golf Club  designed by Tom Weiskopf. Its not until visitors enter MonteLago Village, however, that the Mediterranean theme fully unfolds. Considered a resort-within-a-resort, the 55,000-square-foot commercial village captures the essence and beauty of old-world Europe as cobblestone streets converge into continental plazas. Its an intimate, pedestrian-only community lined with boutiques, residential quarters, and lakeshore bistros and restaurants. And 24-hour entertainment awaits guests at Casino MonteLago, which is 40,000 square feet. Dining options span from New Orleanean to Italian fare in MonteLago. Operated by celebrated Chef Joseph Keller, Comos Steakhouse is a one- of-a-kind eatery that serves traditional American dishes with a French twist. Some of Comos notable dishes include fresh seafood and Angus certified beef. For a formal dining experience, guests can try Sunset and Vines  a chic restaurant and wine bar at the waters edge. Sunset and Vines serves a combination of tapas, salads and soups, Artisan cheeses and hearty entrees coupled with a collection of well-known and rare spirits and wines. With strong Mediterranean roots, the classy Lake Las Vegas Resort takes guests worlds away from home without ever leaving Nevada.
