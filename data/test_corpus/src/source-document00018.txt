ESPN LifeTime forÂ Men

ESPN might be the best thing created after slice white bread. This network for most men is like the lifetime to most women.
Now every morning when I wake up I rollover and turn to ESPN. Since I became a sports fan I was watching Sports Center like it was Saturday morning cartoons. ESPN was the one thing that you can watch over and over and it will always change. When Sports Center decided to become live (the best move by ESPN) you could watch it all day and things would always change because sports are always going on.
I know this is just not an addiction by me. Whenever I walk into a male dominated house I could find ESPN on 85% of the time. ESPN is a network that you can find all type of shows on from Cold Pizza, Sports Center, PTI, Etc. When you see these shows there so consistent you can tell what time it is what out looking at the clock.
This addiction might be ridiculous to some but being a sports fan like me its something that is just natural. Now what if ESPN wasnt around how would thing be then? Would you get your sports news from the 8 minute segment they give you on the local news? Or would you read your local newspaper that only talks about the local team the Redskins and mentions nothing about your Dallas Cowboys?
