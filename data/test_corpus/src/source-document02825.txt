 
Dektronix now can offer its clients the ability to extend their Wireless networks both inside and outside of their office space , through the use of Hawking Technology's High Gain Antenna's , USB and network adapters.
Indoor Antenna's include the following:
 
The H-AI6SD Indoor Directional Antenna boosts your IEEE 802.11b or IEEE 802.11g wireless signal strength from 2dB (Standard) to 6dB! One of the major problems with many wireless networks is the poor coverage area of standard access points and wireless routers. When combined with two directional antennas directed toward each other, your wireless range may be extended up to 2750ft. Hawking Technology HAI15SC, 2.4GHz Hi-Gain Wireless Corner Antenna, boosts your wireless signal strength from 2dBi (standard) to 15dBi! The Hi-Gain Corner Antenna is the perfect solution for providing Wireless coverage in very large rooms, conference halls or buildings. The high power level of the antenna ensures that every corner of your application will be covered. The Hi-Gain Corner Antenna has been specifically designed for easy installation in the corner of a wall. This also allows for easier coverage of an entire building, room or hall.
Hawking Technologies' H-AI6SI (Single Band 802.11b and 802.11g) Wireless Antenna boosts your wireless signal strength from 2dB (standard) to 6dB! As an omni-directional antenna, this unit increase the strength in all directions.
 
OutDoor Antenna Kits:
H-AO8SI is one of Hawking's Hi-Gain 24 series, 2.4 GHz Wireless Antenna Line.The Outdoor Omni-Directional Antenna emits a powerful amplified signal over a 360 degree radius, delivering a strong multi- direction signal from an Access Point or a Bridge.The H-AO8SI also comes with a mounting kit, connectors, and a surge protector. Dektronix Inc. carries 10ft (H-AC10N) and 30ft (H-AC30N) Outdoor antenna cables. However, the shorter the total cable length is, the stronger signal the antenna will have.
The H-AO14SD Outdoor Directional Antenna Kit is currently the  strongest Hi-Gain antenna. When paired with another Hi-Gain antenna it is capable of extending your wireless range up to one and a half mile. The directional design of the antenna creates a 30 degree emission of your highly amplified wireless signal. The Kit includes the outdoor antenna, mounting kit, weather-proof taping and SMA connector cable.
In order to successfully install the antenna, one must purchase either the 10ft(H-AC10N) or 30 ft(H-AC30N) outdoor antenna cable.
