Google Brings Sky from Google Earth to Maps
Google today has released a more complete implementation of the Google Sky data to Google Maps. Back in mid-December Google an API to sky so you could make mashups with Google Sky data for use with the Google Maps web-based interface. However, it didn't allow you full access to all the layers available in Google Earth's version. According to the , a code jam winner who became an intern at Google was given the opportunity to develop a full Maps interface for Sky - and the results were released today at: released post at the Official Google Blog Sky.Google.Com
The new release sports some nice features which lets you view many of the new layers which were introduced to the Google Earth Sky interface back in . This includes the full-sky microwave layer, samples from the Spitz Infrared space telescope, and much more. Not only that, but there are handy opacity (transparency) sliders which let you compare one frequency with another. I was remarking on the way to do this in a post about a new add-on for the Earth-based Sky which shows a bunch of other wavelengths from NASA's Skyview database (read the bottom of the post under ""). I may have to do a video tutorial explaining how to use this feature. Right now its easier to use the transparency feature in this new Maps-based version. (I do wish there was a name change to differentiate between the Google Sky mode in Google Earth verses the new Google Sky mode for Google maps.) Anyway, I'm glad to see yet another way to view the data. I love astronomy! January Just today Advanced tips
Watch the short video Google put up in their post today which gives you a brief glimpse at the features:
