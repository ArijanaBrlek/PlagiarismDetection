Bellingham WA Comparative Market Analysis Service
 
Our home value service is available for all Whatcom County, and surrounding counties of Skagit, Island, San Juan. This service is designed to help you determine a preliminary estimate of value on your home, house or other real estate property for the purposes of assisting you in your decision to market your home. This valuation estimate is based on recent comparable sales, property values, and area prices of homes and houses. This estimate is not intended to be, nor should it be, relied on as a real estate appraisal or similar report rendered by a licensed, professional appraiser.
 
However, as a real estate agent we do prepare Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) based on very similar concepts derived from comparing recent sales in the Bellingham real estate market and the subject property. To receive a professional appraisal, you can call us and we will refer you to one of the licensed real estate appraisal professionals at the Muljat Group.
