Getting Lost is a Thing of the Past
If you don’t own a GPS (global positioning system), or have never even thought about one – I highly recommend you reconsider.
GPS devices/units show you turn by turn directions on how to get to just about any destination. GPS devices are also known for having millions of ‘points of interest’. For example, if you’re craving coffee, need to get to the closest bank, grocery store, post office, etc., your GPS device can either show or tell you with a touch of a button, how to get there. Higher end models are so advanced in technology, that some are even chiming every time you pass a church! There are also many options from the high to low end, which are priced for just about any type of budget.
But here’s the deal – have you ever thought about how a GPS device actually works? I mean really – how can a little device smaller than a postcard get you to the closest shopping mall, alert you when you’re in a school zone, keep you awake on the road with customized messages, and make you pancakes? Okay, well… maybe not the pancakes, but everyone should agree the capabilities of these devices are pretty amazing!
I recently had a chance to ride along with NAVTEQ. They are known as “creators of digital maps and map content that power navigation and location-based services solutions around the world”. They took us on back roads and as we drove, they literally translated any visible road information (home addresses, lane changes, road signs, etc.) directly to a computer. Let me tell you - you’d be surprised how much information is on the road and just what is updated from month to month.
So, anyhow, next time you’re jonesing to find that coffee shop in the middle of nowhere – know that someone may have taken one for the team to get you to that soy peppermint latte or even better spared you a ticket by alerting you that you were driving like a bat out of hell. I’ll be sharing more about NAVTEQ in upcoming posts. In the meantime if you have any questions or comments about anything GPS related shoot me a line…
Until next time, stay tuned…
I also wanted to answer some outstanding questions from recent posts:
I would like to know will I still need a cable provider if I get a HDTV?E from NY
If you want to continue to watch cable channels (ESPN, MTV, CNN) then you will need a cable/satellite provider still. The only difference an HDTV (without a cable provider ) will do for you is allow you to watch over-the-air broadcasts in High Definition which is limited to major networks (ABC,NBC,CBS etc). You can also purchase HD antennas. These work in a similar manner as a built in digital tuner would, but you can lose the quality of the HD picture.
If I buy a TV from HSN will it have a built in digital tuner? How will I know if the descriptions aren't that explicit or I don't actually hear you say it does?J from MN
Any HDTV purchased on HSN will have a built-in digital tuner. Manufacturers are no longer allowed to import TVs without them, however there may be old stocks still being sold by some retailers. Also, it’s interesting to note that any retailer in the US that is selling a television without HD capability is required by law to have that TV labeled as such or a label within “close proximity” of the non HD compliant television, or else the FCC hits them with a fine of about $8,000 per non labeled tv. On top of that most retailers have a 30 day return policy as well, just in case.
I would like to know, if I buy HDTV (WITH HD Tuner) will I also need a converter box in Feb. 09?B from WV
No you will not require a converter box if your television is equipped with a HD Tuner. Unless you still want to receive all of your cable channels, in which case your cable company would provide you with a digital cable box, which also usually requires a monthly service charge.
Time for an upgrade
These will get you up to speed …
