Research
A program dedicated to the latest spinal cord injury research.
Each year, hundreds of research projects are conducted all over the world on spinal cord injury.  Many of these studies are relevant to our work here at Project Walk. These research papers may deal with physiological, neurological, and biochemical changes that are not easily understandable.
