The toilet used on the is called the (WCS). In addition to air flow, it also uses rotating fans to distribute solid waste for in-flight storage. Solid waste is distributed in a cylindrical container which is then exposed to vacuum to dry the waste. Liquid waste is vented to space. During , one of the fans malfunctioned, and crew member was required to perform in-flight maintenance (IFM). An earlier, complete failure, on the eight-day test flight, forced its two-man crew ( and ) to use the much-hated "Apollo Bag" for waste elimination and disposal.

The toilet on the located in the module uses a fan-driven suction system similar to the WCS. Liquid waste is collected in 20 litre containers. Solid waste is collected in individual micro-perforated bags which are stored in an aluminum container. Full containers are transferred to for disposal. An additional is scheduled be part of the module to be launched in 2010. In 2007, NASA purchased a Russian-made toilet similar to the one already aboard ISS rather than develop one internally.

On May 21, 2008, the 7-year-old toilet's gas liquid separator pump failed, although the solid waste portion is still functioning. The crew attempted replacing various parts, but was unable to repair the malfunctioning part. In the interim, they used a manual mode for urine collection. The crew has other options: use the toilet on the transport module (which only has capacity for a few days of use) or to use urine collection bags as needed. A replacement pump was sent from Russia in a so that could bring it to the station as part of mission on . [6] Soyuz [7] diplomatic pouch Space Shuttle Discovery STS-124 June 2nd [8] [9] [10]

While the had an onboard toilet facility since its introduction in 1967 (due to the additional space in the Orbital Module), all and spacecraft required astronauts to urinate in a so-called "relief tube," in which the contents were dumped into space (an example would be the urine dump seen in the movie ), while fecal matter were collected in specially-designed bags known as "Apollo Bags," which were a bane to all crew members. The space station, used by NASA between May, 1973 and March, 1974, had an onboard WCS facility which served as a prototype for the Shuttle's WCS, but also featured an onboard shower facility. The Skylab toilet, which was designed and built by the Fairchild Republic Corp. on Long Island, was primarily a medical system to collect and return to earth samples of urine, feces and vomit so that calcium balance in astronauts could be studied.
