Radio mixshows are among               the most prestigious residencies in the world of deejaying. A               typical night on the air will likely have your mix reaching more               people than your biggest and best night at any club that you'll               ever spin for. It's a highly competitive sector of the industry               with a finite number of available slots and an infinite number               of candidates who are interested in filling them. Getting your               foot in the door isn't the easiest of things to do, but it's               not impossible. Here are a few suggestions for getting started.                                 If you have a local station in mind to submit a mixshow demo               to, give yourself a leg up by doing a bit of research first.               Make note of what the station plays, and more importantly, what               the station doesn't play. Listen for new music and how frequently               (or infrequently) such music is added to their rotation. Playlists               are a valuable tool as well, many of which can easily be found               online. These things will allow you to tailor a demo package               that's best suited to the station's sound, image, and overall               presentation.                                 Anything that you submit to a radio station for consideration               should have your contact information on it (phone numbers, website,               email address, etc). That includes your demo CD, bio, submission               letter "you name it." It doesn't hurt to spend a few               bucks at the office supply store either. A clearly printed label               for the CD itself and a professionally-made business card (neither               of which are terribly expensive these days) both go a long way               to making your submission look that much more professional.                                 Write a full-page bio about yourself as DJ. That's great -- now               cut it down to a few simple paragraphs. The station doesn't need               your life story, just the most relevant points about who you               are what you do. Likewise, your demo should showcase your mixing               and programming talents without being overly zealous. Bells &               whistles in the mix are nice but best kept to a minimum if you               haven't truly mastered them. Use any custom ID's or drops that               you may have sparingly as well (having them professionally produced               doesn't hurt either).                                 They're seldom glamorous and most are unpaid, but internships               can offer you entrance into the radio world while teaching you               a lot about the industry in the process. You'll see how the business               works first-hand and cultivate a better idea as to how to pursue               your own goals down the road. Many a successful mixshow deejay               first got their start working as an assistant or an intern or               in some other facet of the business.                                 The time & attention of a station's program director and/or               on-air staff is inevitably split among countless tasks at just               about any given moment. Twice-daily calls or emails aren't likely               to elicit a faster or more favorable response from them. Proper               follow-up on your submission is a must but be mindful to do so               in moderation; and take action accordingly on any suggestions               or guidance that they offer you.                                 Mixshows and the deejays that create them are a small (and important)               part of a much larger whole, and that whole has its best chance               for success when its individual parts are working together towards               the same goals. Always remember that the station's agenda is               your agenda -- not the other way around.                                 As a medium, radio is consistently at the mercy of the ever-shrinking               attention spans of its listeners. Deejays by nature are creative               people, many of which like to break new ground or set themselves               apart with what they do. Just remember that your typical listener               probably isn't as savvy as you are when it comes to music (after               all, you're the deejay -- not them). Familiarity is a good thing               to keep sight of when programming your sets, and sandwiching               those newer tracks and remixes in-between staple hits is an easy               and effective way to keep people tuned in to your show.                                 What works in the club doesn't necessarily translate as well               over the airwaves. That nine-minute anthem mix of your favorite               track that often whips dance-floors into a peak-hour tizzy is               very likely to have radio listeners reaching for another preset               sooner than later. Keep in mind that the length of most songs               played in regular rotation fall somewhere between 3:00 and 4:30               on average. Getting to the meat of the tracks you play in your               mixshow is advisable, as is not letting individual tracks drag               on for too long.                                 Breathing new life into records that you find yourself playing               over & over again is an easy way to help keep your listeners               interested. Remixes and edits of most popular tracks can be found               in droves these days, but creating your own can really put a               customized spin on what you do. Conjuring up your own remixes,               edits, and mash-ups may take time to properly master, but it's               an investment in your craft that could potentially pay off in               more ways than one.                                 Radio is a diverse and multi-faceted medium, a multi-million               dollar industry that is as competitive and unpredictable as they               come. Hands-on experience and proper networking will afford you               the opportunity to expand your own skill sets time-and-time again.               Countless mixshow deejays first got their start doing something               else within the radio business, and many of them have gone to               bigger and better things within the industry as well. The more               you learn, the more likely you are to become one of them.
