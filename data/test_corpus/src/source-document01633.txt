Horseback Riding:If you love horses, you'll have an unforgettable experience riding along the beaches of Puerto Rico. Horseback riding is a favorite activity in Puerto Rico - and there is a long tradition of raising 'paso fino' horses. There are two stables in the Rincon area that you can contact directly or arrange a day of horseback riding through your hotel once you arrive in Rincon. Even if you've never ridden a horse before - beginners are welcome!
