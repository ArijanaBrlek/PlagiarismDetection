Extended Information
The new Roland Fantom G8 features a powerful new audio processor that provides new sonic depth and versatility. The Fantom-G8 has twice the wave-ROM capacity of its predecessor, and contains a treasure trove of Roland's world-famous SRX-quality sounds. But what really sets Fantom G8 apart is its new ARX expansion, which allows additional SuperNATURAL sound-sets and fully dedicated synth and effects engines to be added to this already powerful live workstation. SuperNATURAL ARX Expansion Fantom-G8 provides ARX slots that accommodate two SuperNATURAL expansion boards. SuperNATURAL is Roland's unique behavior-modeling technology that enables a new level of organic, emotional expression previously unattainable in synthesizers. Applied to traditional-instrument sounds, SuperNATURAL enables the delicate, organic tonal changes and playing nuances of real musical instruments. It's also a powerful tool for electronic and non-traditional sounds, breathing amazing new life and expression into synthesis. Power Sequencer Onboard The Fantom-G is the first Roland instrument to feature Roland's newly designed power sequencer. In conjunction with the large-size LCD, this pro-level composition tool provides 128 tracks (including 24 audio tracks) in a fully integrated audio/MIDI graphical environment. A mouse can be also incorporated for computer-like speed and ease. Other convenient features include combo XLR and TRS connector, phantom power for condenser mics, Hi-Z input for guitar and bass, and line input. Luxurious Extra-Wide LCD One look and touch and you'll know that the Fantom-G is an instrument without equal. Only the highest-quality materials have been used to create this dream synth, with a stylish, futuristic design that will turn heads. Front and center is the extra-large 8.5" wide TFT color LCD for enhanced productivity. A first-class assortment of hand son controls is provided as well, including eight sliders, four knobs, and ten buttons below the LCD. Amazing FX Fantom-G8 is loaded with a state-of-the-art effects engine, with multi-effects available for each Fantom-G sound/part. In 16-part multi-timbre mode, up to 22 effect routings can be used simultaneously. Create complex setups with 16 insert effects per patch, plus global reverbs and choruses. Mastering effects are provided for polishing songs created with the onboard sequencer. Supreme Keyboard Feel & Action The Fantom-G8 is outfitted with Roland's top-of-the-line PHA II "Ivory Feel" keyboard. This amazing keyboard technology reproduces the real surface feel of ivory acoustic piano keys providing a familiar stability and comfort to the pianist. The white keys have a 2-piece structure which reduces the surface 'click' noise when playing. The newly developed keyboard surface material is designed to absorb moisture, ensuring a secure, slip-proof feel that your fingers will love.
