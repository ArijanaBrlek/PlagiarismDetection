Our Salute to the "Weekend Warrior"
Not everyone chooses to play trombone as a profession. That's probably a very good thing:-)
Many folks find that their talents lie in disciplines such as business, law, medicine, car repair, sales or other careers. The smart ones, though, realize how much music adds to their quality of life and how much it means to them and their families. In my experience, it is always a joy to sit next to these people and make music with them. They play for all the right reasons. They play because they love it! Not in it for the money (although it's a nice perk), they do it for more honorable and sustaining rewards: joy, comraderie, an "escape" from daily stresses, a way to connect with other human beings in a most intimate fashion, a fascination with sound, a cure for the mundane life and a way to be "special" and unique amongst their peers...
My experience has also shown that a certian level of frustration can arise within these players. They might have memories of playing at a much higher level; might be able to hear something in their head but not have the technique to reproduce it; maybe they're intimidated by the players around them who have more time to practice and stay in shape.....
In any case, what we aspire to do here with the Salute to Weekend Warriors is give these music-lovers the tools they'll need to play to the very best of their abilities. Your lives are insanely busy. We know that. But you want to suck as much marrow from the musical bone as you can, right? All we ask for is 15 minutes a day. ANYONE can find 15 minutes in the course of the day, right? Maybe this means waking up 15 minutes earlier or staying awake 15 minutes more at night. It won't even require a trombone on some days, but doing the exercises below will give you the technical facility, muscular strength, and confidence to "hold your own" come Friday night at the dance-band gig or Sunday morning at the Church service. Pledge 15 minutes a day and enjoy the many benefits as your level of artistry rises week after week, month after month, year after year.
What the Weekend Warrior MUST focus on is the BASICS.
Be ever-vigilant against allowing self-judgement, ego, frustration, fatigue, and warped perceptions to distort these simple, basic concepts:
1) Why do we play trombone?
We love the tone. We're awed by it's beauty of sound. We have fun working the slide. We like the feel of it in our hands, against our lips. It looks cool. It has a colorful past in many, many genres of music. Beethoven revered it; Berlioz heard the Heavens in it; Mozart caused it to weep; Dorsey made it sing; Teagarden made it dance. It's a versatile, thoroughly enjoyable noise-maker. It's the best thing that's happened to music since rhythm and we have the ability to make it go.
2)What makes a trombone work?
AIRFLOW passing through taut (NOT tight) lips puts the LIPS in VIBRATION. These vibrations then put the air column inside the trombone into sympathetic vibration, thus giving pitch and tone. That's it. Period. End.
3)What are we TRYING to sound like?
Do you have a concept in your imagination that enables you to make the music come alive? Every musical phrase is a chance to evoke CREATIVITY. Don't waste a single opportunity. Phrases even within a composition differ greatly in personality (thank God!). Here are some concepts I relate to:
Crystal-clear piccollo trumpet, rotund basso profundo, liquid soprano aria, heavy rosin on a cello bow, jazz ballad, raindrops on rice paper, a mouse running on glass, a rock crashing through glass, a curious cat with intrepid bravery, a victorious warrior after a siege, Niagra Falls, Notre Dame Cathedral, peace, anger, dark twilight blue, city traffic.....
There's truly no limit to the images that might trigger your imagination. The more adept you become at evoking concepts, images, and feelings, the better player you'll be. Take a chance with every note. Be an explorer of creativity. EVOKE something. EXPRESS something.
4)Do we have the proper equipment to make the sound we hear in our head? (Say this aloud 3 times :"There is no magic bullet")
WARNING: the pitfalls of becoming an "equipment freak" FAR outweigh the benefits. We all know these people. They've spent a small fortune to play the same set-up as "so-and-so in the Acme Phil". They have 14 mouthpieces for every occasion. They KNOW it's their leadpipe that's holding them back.
Weekend Warriors are far more likely to be "equipment freaks" than pros. That's because they often have much more disposable income than trombone pros and they have more freedom to try things that might not work. Pros don't have the luxury of trying a set-up for a few months. When it's the trombone that pays the bills, it's GOTTA work on any given night. What we do is find the most comfortable rig that gives us our desired sound and consistency and we set about MAKING it work. We've spent enough time evaluating, analyzing, test-driving stuff that we know there's no magic bullet. Let our miserable experiences spare you years of heartache, OK?
That being said, PROPER equipment will indeed enhance your musical enjoyment and keeping your trombone in good condition makes the music flow a little easier from your imagination. For instance, if you play primarily lead trombone in a jazz band, don't play a big-bore horn with a deep mouthpiece. Find a good small-bore tenor and try a shallow mouthpiece ( I play a Schilke 47 for lead stuff on a Silversonic 2B). Not only will your life be easier on this set-up, you'll be more within the proper style for the music.
Conversely, if you play a lot of brass quintets and/or chamber things, don't play a pea-shooter small bore horn. Buy a large bore tenor with a reasonable mouthpiece (try maybe a 5G, a 6.5AL, or 5GS). Your tone will be nice and broad and will fit more with the style.
If you can only afford one instrument but play a variety of styles, split the difference: find a medium bore tenor (.525" bore) and use a middle-of-the-road mouthpiece like the 6.5AL. Conn makes a dual-bore slide for the 8H and 88H tenor models that tapers from .525" to .547". This is a fantastic option for the Weekend Warrior that wants to play a variety of styles. I also have an Olds Recording that I found for $300. Dual-bore with a rich, warm sound. It's nearly 50 years old and might be the best Weekend Warrior trombone I've ever played. It could move from a brass quintet to a big band with little effort. Look around, contact your local music store, search the want-ads, peruse the Internet. Great trombones are out there waiting to be rescued. No need to spend a fortune, either. Viable options can be had for little money.
STOP SEARCHING FOR THE MAGIC BULLET and adopt a versatile, practical instrument that gives you the sound you desire.

Keeping the above concepts in mind, then, what can we do to be the best we can be? In the course of our very busy lives, how do we make the best use of our time to develop as trombonists, and more importantlymusicians.
1) Read and re-read #1 above.Never forget that it's about the JOY. If you can manage to transmit your joy out the bell, you are well on your way. Don't let trivial BS upset you on gigs or in the practice room. Resist pettiness like the plague. Smile all the time. Enjoy what you're doing. Admit your faults, accept others' faults and be supportive. Be the person that others love to play with.
2) A lot. It feeds the imagination, gives ideas about articulations, helps intonation, develops a sense of and makes you a better musician. Sing along to the radio in the car, sing at the office, while you do the honey-dos around the house. Try scat-singing to jazz music. It's a wonderful habit. Every piece of music you're preparing should be sung.Sing.Phrasing,
3) What do you know about the black dots on the page before you? The more you know, the more effective your interpretation will be. Try getting inside the composer's head and heart and play from that perspective. The Internet is a very valuable tool for this. Try going to and doing some searches. Knowledge is power!Research the Life and Times of the composers you're playing. google.com
4) In any place at any time, we can practice the most important aspect of our trombone playing: the BREATH. By far the most common deficiency I see in the Weekend Warrior is their inefficient use of the BREATH. (See #2 above: What makes a trombone work?) Believe it or not, we don't need nor want a STRONG embouchure. "Strong" embouchures equal thin tone and poor flexibility. Most weekend warriors ask me how to build strength when I see clearly that they don't use their AIR very effectively. Forget about embouchure strength. Move copious amounts of free-flowing air and most embouchure woes will go away. Try these wonderful exercises (some are mine, some I learned via Sam Pilafian, the wonderful tubist)BREATHE.
- at one beat per second, inhale through the mouth for 4 beats, hold it for 4 , exhale for 4 and relax for 4. (repeat 10 times). That's 2 minutes and 40 seconds worth of EXCELLENT practice. Often, I'll raise my arms above my head as I inhale, then let them fall as I hold my breath, being careful to keep my chest high and round. Try it.....but not while you're driving:-)without locking the throat
-Next, the "Paper Airplane" breath: inhale for 4 beats as you prepare to throw your imaginary paper airplane (actually HOLD the airplane......remember how important the imagination is!), then for 4 beats LAUNCH the airplane and give it a tailwind with a steady, smooth exhale. Watch it as it soars upward out of sight. (Repeat 5 times), then:
- "Bow and Arrow Breath": for 4 beats pull back on the string (FEEL the tension), spot your target, then release the arrow with a 2-beat propulsion exhale. Rest 2 beats and repeat. (5 times), then:
- "Dart Breath": this time, you're throwing a dart. 2 beats to inhale as you spot the bullseye, then 1 beat sends the dart on a very fast exhale towards it's target. Rest one beat, repeat. (5 times)
All told, that's 260 seconds, or just over 4 minutes. This is the most important 4 minutes of practice you'll do EVERY SINGLE DAY. Once in the morning, once in afternoon, once in the evening before bed. That's nearly 15 minutes total and we haven't even touched the trombone! Trust me......do it. You'll feel better and play better GUARANTEED!
When it comes time to make music, you'll play beautiful phrases by blowing Paper Airplanes, lovely pesante marcatos by blowing Bow and Arrows, and very effective sforzandos by blowing Darts.
Now, if it's a good day and you have time to pick up the trombone, do this quick warm-up before playing ANYTHING else:
-pick any major or minor scale in the middle of your comfortable range (try Bb, D, C, or something similar). All these scales, by the way, are in the of this site. Play the first 4 notes up and down slowly at an easy mezzoforte. Then BUZZ the same thing in the mouthpiece alone. Feel the FLAT chin, tucked corners ("gently firm"), lips touching all the way across, and EVERYTHING inside the rim buzzing at pitch. The center of your aperture is relaxed and supple. The lips swing closed like saloon doors. The buzz is like rich, creamy pudding. Think Paper Airplane...... General Area
Next, play the entire scale up and down slowly at mezzoforte. Then BUZZ it.
Lastly, play the triad (1st,3rd,5th,8th scale notes) up in half notes, and the scale down in quarter notes, repeating the top note. Then BUZZ it.
Do this exercise 4 times: one middle-range scale, one low, one high, another middle-range.
-Then try the following exercise, developed by the great Ed Kleinhammer in his excellent book:"The Art of Trombone Playing":
It's important that you "push the envelope" with your and dynamics. Breathe whenever you need to, but try doing the in ONE breath. Don't proceed to 6th position until all FOUR variations are played in 7th.ffpppp
- After doing this exercise, play some low descending scales at VERY soft dynamics to warm down. Come back later in the day, if time allows, to work on your prepared pieces for the week. Practicing in short bursts (10-15 minutes) a few times a day is the BEST way to practice. If you simply can't make that happen, though, stick to the above warm-up and you'll get in good shape very quickly.
