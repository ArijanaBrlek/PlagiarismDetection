It would be sad if not unthinkable to be in without visiting , a small town that is less than one hour away from the capital and famous for its crafts and woodwork. San Jose Sarchi
The little town itself is simple enough, considering it is now known to be the major craft center of the country. As one approaches it, souvenir and furniture shops begin to appear on the sides of the road. Jewelry boxes, kitchen utensils like bowls and trays, sculptured animals, mirrors made of precious wood, rocking chairs, stools, tables, you name it, they have it or they will make it.
Ox carts or careta, come in all sizes and are everywhere; these typically represent the country. Before the cars made their way to the souvenir shelves, the coffee was traditionally transported in these caretas. Some are quite large, and are made of various types of wood, giving them a unique design, and are used as little mini-bars. Others are brightly painted and may be used as small decorations to be put on shelves, or as big as the real ones, to be admired in a garden or on a terrace.
Foreigners are not the only tourists buying in Sarchi. Many Costa Ricans buy their furniture there, as it has the reputation of being well made and of good quality, as well as looking really good. The rocking chairs especially seem to be really popular. Teak, rosewood or cocobolo, Ron Ron and ironwood are just a few examples of the wood you will see there.
Dinning rooms, desks, shelves of all different styles, sizes and shapes are on display or can be custom made; there are some factories that can be visited, where you can see how these oxcarts are made, especially at the . This is where the first oxcart was carved, it opened in 1902, and it is located on the towns main road. There is another interesting factory just out of the town's center. It is simply mesmerizing how the energy of the water of the nearby river is used to power all the tools needed for the craft; a series of belts are interconnected and can easily be changed at will according to the size of the object desired. It is simply wonderful to watch. The factory is a little hard to find, but most shop owners will be able to direct you, or if you prefer, you can go with an organized tour, there are plenty to choose from.
