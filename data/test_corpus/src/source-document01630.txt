The Upsidedown Map Page
It needn't be a Eurocentric world
It came as a surprise to me after over 20 years of seeing "normal" world maps to come across an upside down one. The most surprising thing was that I found it surprising. It is completely artificial that we have North at the top of a map.
The convention came a few centuries ago when Northern hemisphere, European navigators started using the North star and the magnetic compass. Before that, the top of the map was to the East which is where the word ation comes from.orient

Then a friend bought me an Australian map that was on sale in Japan. Not only does it have South at the top, but it is also "rotated" so that China, Indonesia and Australia are in the centre rather than Europe and West Africa.
Hard to believe that I'd not only been educated into one stereotype about maps, but even after learning that stereotype had failed to spot the other one.
I'm interested in Upsidedown Maps because they make me rethink the world. It's important to remember that there are people all over it. Since hanging one on my wall I've learnt geography again. You can reevaluate the world from scratch, as if it was a brand new alien landscape.
Indonesia looks like by far the most interesting place from orbit.

Arabia (Ancient): They put south at the top. This is because when you wake up and face the sun, south is on the right. Because of positive associations with the right as opposed to left, they put that on top. Yemen is so named because it is on the "yamin" right of Arabia. And of course, with the sea to the south of them there was nothing "on top" of the country, so they prefered it that way. Europeans learnt mapmaking from the Arabians and flipped the map to make themselves on top. [ Source: email from Jessica who heard a talk by an American Muslim scholar called Hamza Yusuf. ]

Biblical Times: There is evidence from the Torah that east was at the top of maps. In Genesis, Abraham's nephew, Lot, is captured in war and carried away. Abraham races to the rescue.

Joaqu n Torres, a Uruguayan painter, lived in Barcelona in the early 1900s.

Most of the world's land mass is in the northern hemisphere, and discusses how this has influenced map orientation. It goes on to explain why the direction of clockwise is bias - because in the north sundial shadows move that way. Anyone know of any anti-clockwise clocks which have been marketed as "down under"? Deley also gives a link to Straight Dope's take on .
