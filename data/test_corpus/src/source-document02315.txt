The lapidary instruction is offered by the shop monitors who open the shop up on Tuesday evenings and 1st and 3rd Saturday mornings; .Â Beginners can be instructed by the monitors concerning the safe operation of the equipment and how to cut slabs and make cabochons. see shop schedule
There are often other instructors available as well, offering instruction for wire-wrapping and faceting. At various times, we have also offered instruction on suiseki, faceting, cabochons, wire-wrapping, diaza making, and rock art carving.
The shop equipment includes large and small table saws, trim saws, grinding wheels, polishing wheels, lapping machines and tumbling machines
Some of our members compete by displaying their lapidary art pieces and faceted gemsat our annual club show, club meetings, other club shows, the annual California Federation Show and the Faceters Guild Shows.
To put this all in perspective, a member who joined the club a just year ago, collected some material on a club field trip. He then learned in our club lapidary shop how to make cabochons and belt buckle ovals. He then competed at our club meeting cabochon competition, and he won!
