Hearing senses sound
In s, hearing is performed by the s, which also perform the function of , a sense in itself but not one of the traditional list (due to ). This is in common with most s. Many other s also have some form of , either by some sort of ear, or by other structures, or by a combination. human being ear balance Aristotle mammal organism hearing
A common rule of thumb used to describe human hearing is that human hearing is sensitive in the range of of 20 to 20 , though this varies significantly with age, occupational hearing damage, and gender; some individuals are able to hear up to 22 kHz and perhaps beyond, while others are limited to about 16 kHz. Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called or referred to as . Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as , while frequencies below audio are referred to as . frequency Hz kHz audio sonic ultrasonic infrasonic
Some organisms are able to ultrasound and/or infrasound. Some s use ultrasound for while in flight. s are able to hear ultrasound, which is the principle of 'silent' s. s sense infrasound through their bellies, and there is evidence that s and s may use it for communication. See for hearing ranges of various organisms.hear bat The microbats constitute the suborder Microchiroptera within the order Chiroptera ( bats). Other English names are "insectivorous bats", "echolocating bats", "small bats" or "true bats". All these names are somewhat inaccurate, because not all microbats f echo location Animal echolocation is the ability of some animals to locate objects by emitting sound waves and listening for the echo. This is used to detect obstacles, predators and prey. It is used by bats, dolphins and some whales. Two bird groups also employ this s Dog This article discusses the domestic dog. For other members of the dog family, see Canidae. The dog is a canine omnivorous mammal that has been domesticated for somewhere between 14,000 and 150,000 years. In those millennia, the dog has developed into hund dog whistle A dog whistle is a type of whistle used in the training of dogs. The frequency range of a dog whistle is largely out of the range of human hearing. Typically, a dog whistle is within the range of 5800 Hz to 12400 Hz. Some dog whistles have adjustable slid Snake Acrochordidae Aniliidae Anomalepididae Anomochilidae Atractaspididae Boidae Bolyeriidae Colubridae Cylindrophiidae Elapidae Hydrophiidae Leptotyphlopidae Loxocemidae Pythonidae Tropidophiidae Typhlopidae Uropeltidae Viperidae Xenopeltidae Snakes are cold whale Whales are the largest species of exclusively aquatic placental mammals, dfsgRSFNjg A complete up-to-date taxonomical listing of all cetacean species, including all whales is maintained at the Cetacea article.

There is some evidence of human ability to unconsiously detect ultrasound and infrasound. Infrasound has been found to affect the s (see ). Some pipes reach as low as 16 Hz, which is 'felt' more than 'heard'. emotion In psychology, and in ordinary language, emotion is used to describe a state of a person. Examples of emotions are fear, anger, joy, hate; see list of emotions. Emotional state is related to mood, sometimes even identified with it, although emotions are g infrasound organ
