at our beaches has become a weekly thing for the local Surfrider Foundation Chapter. These tests prove what our wise grandparents taught us all those years ago: When it rains in the mountains and the clarity of our pristine off-shore waters changes, you shouldn't spend too many hours in the ocean. Common sense tells us that the rain-laden rivers and streams carry silt and other organics that swirl off-shore until the currents take them out to sea. So here's our response to the surfers who have written asking about the water tests: Surfers who want to spend an entire rainy day in the water should consider earplugs to avoid possible ear problems, just like surfers at the California coast don body suits to keep warm and surf more.Testing the waters
