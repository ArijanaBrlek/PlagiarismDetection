Besides the , Euclid wrote numerous other books. We have the texts of four others, , , , and is a collection of 94 geometric propositions, deals with problems of dividing a given figure by one or more straight lines into others with desired properties of shape and area. It was used by Leonardo of Pisa in his of 1220. is the first Greek treatise on perspective, with geometrical propositions on the rectilinear propagation of light. is an introduction to mathematical astronomy. Since it closely resembles the style of the earlier treatise "On the Moving Sphere" by (c. 330 BCE), historians have concluded that Euclid did not necessarily invent the form of his works.ElementsDataOn Divisions of Figuresthe Phaenomenathe Optics.DataOn Division of FiguresPractica geometriaeThe OpticsThe Phaenomena Autolycus
From Greek commentators one learns of several books that have been lost. They include (on fallacies); (on conditions determining curves); (which was superseded by a similar work of Apollonius); (perhaps dealing with cones, spheres, and cylinders, or with curves on these surfaces); (possibly including the Pythagorean theory of harmony); and (on the properties of mirrors). A surviving bearing Euclid's name is in reality a later compilationpossibly by (c. 350 CE)but it probably is based upon an authentic Euclidean work of the same name and in the same form. Arabic writers also attribute to Euclid various treatises on mechanics including books on the balance and on specific gravity.PseudariaPorismsConicsSurface LociElements of MusicCatoptricsCatoptrics Theon of Alexandria
