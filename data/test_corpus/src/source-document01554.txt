TORNADO
dark, funnel-shaped cloud containing violently rotating air that develops below a heavy cumulonimbus cloud mass and extends toward the earth. The funnel twists about, rises and falls, and where it reaches the earth causes great destruction. The diameter of a tornado varies from a few feet to a mile; the rotating winds attain velocities of 200 to 300 mi (320480 km) per hr, and the updraft at the center may reach 200 mi per hr. The is the standard scale for rating the severity of a tornado as measured by the damage it causes. A tornado is usually accompanied by thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and a loud "freight train" noise. Fujita scale
In comparison with a or , a tornado covers a much smaller area but can be violent and destructive. The atmospheric conditions required for the formation of a tornado include great thermal instability, high humidity, and the convergence of warm, moist air at low levels with cooler, drier air aloft. Although tornadoes have occurred on every continent except Antarctica, they are most common in the continental United States, where tornadoes typically form over the central and southern plains and the Gulf states, usually several hundred miles southeast of a cyclone. A tornado travels in a generally northeasterly direction with a speed of 20 to 40 mi (3264 km) per hr. The length of a tornado's path along the ground varies from less than one mile to several hundred. Tornadoes occurring over water are called . cyclone hurricane waterspouts
