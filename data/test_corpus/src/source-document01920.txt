The question is, how much more black could it be? The answer, in the words of the inimitable Nigel Tufuel, is, “none.” With no extraneous adornment—such as labels for the keys—the Das Keyboard is really, seriously black. This is a keyboard that leaves hunt-and-peckers crying for mercy.
When you put a plank like this on your desk, you’re sending a message. You’re saying, “I’m a badass typist, and I know it.” The truly beautiful thing is that the Das Keyboard also says, “I’m a discriminating typist.” Even without the no-label gimmick, this is a keyboard worth cherishing—we wouldn’t attach just any keyboard to our Dream Machine, after all.
The Das Keyboard’s secret is in its individually weighted keys. While all the keys on standard keyboards require the same amount of force to depress, the Das Keyboard has five different groups of keys, each of which responds to a different degree of force to accommodate the way most people use a keyboard.
For example, the space bar, where you might naturally rest your thumbs, requires substantially more pressure than normal, so as to avoid inadvertent depression; while keys you press with your pinkies and ring fingers (also known as the wussy fingers) require much less than the normal amount of pressure, so as not to strain those delicate digits. Though seemingly minor, the differences in pressure make typing on the Das Keyboard a sublime experience.
The key action is extremely satisfying, with just enough of a click to let you know you pushed down the key, but not so much noise it’ll keep your spouse awake in the next room. We’d love it if the Das Keyboard included an integrated USB hub and came in an ergonomic split option, but we’ve got to hand it to the folks at Metadot, nonetheless. The company took a standard Keytronics keyboard shell and built a board whose praises we’ll be singing for years. —
