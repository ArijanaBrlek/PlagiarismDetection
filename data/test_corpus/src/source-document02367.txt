Amazing Milwaukee
Milwaukee is a revelation for visitors. The city is known for its ethnic communities, industrial heritage and sports teams. But you'll soon discover that Milwaukee is "big league" in many ways.
World-famous architecture and glorious Lake Michigan vistas beckon just a few blocks east of the UWM campus. Milwaukee supports a dynamic and diverse arts scene, with an exhibition and performance calendar that's the envy of much larger cities.
Even the city's best-loved institutions offer surprises: the IMAX domed theater at the Milwaukee Public Museum adds a planetarium; the Milwaukee County Zoo opens a multi-level "Giraffe Experience"; and the Milwaukee Art Museum creates an exhibit that will travel to the mus√©e du Louvre.
Depending on the time of year, visitors enjoy ice skating in the heart of downtown or dance to the beat of a favorite band at the lakefront Summerfest grounds.
Whatever intrigues you, be sure to set aside time to sample what the city has to offer.
