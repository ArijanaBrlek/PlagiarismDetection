The College Board Launches an Official New SAT® Practice Test Online
Students Can Familiarize Themselves with the Revised Test at No Cost
09/22/04
NEW YORK -- Students can now test themselves online in preparation for the new SAT® that will debut next March. The College Board, which owns the SAT, has placed an official practice exam on its online new SAT Preparation Center™ Web site, . www.collegeboard.com/srp
The official practice test is one piece of the College Board's SAT Readiness Program™. It is designed to reinforce a student's test-taking skills and to allow students to become more comfortable with the new version of the nation's most popular college entrance exam. By taking the official practice test, students can gain a good idea of what to expect on the actual exam. The new SAT will include three sections: math, critical reading, and a new writing section with an essay.
Everything a student needs to take and score the practice test is online, including an answer sheet and instructions on how to score the test. Students should set aside sufficient time so that they can take the test in a single sitting, and they should allow themselves the specified time for each section.
They should also sit at a table or desk that has been cleared of all papers and books, and should have a calculator on hand to use for the math section. Taking the official practice test will be most helpful if students take it under conditions as close as possible to those of the actual test.
This official practice test is just one of the numerous resources the College Board is providing to students through the SAT Readiness Program to help get them ready for upcoming changes to the SAT.
Beginning on October 18, they will be able to go to collegeboard.com, enter their answers to the official practice test, and receive a free online score report and skills report. These reports will help students better identify areas for development and where to focus their study. In addition, students will also be able to access answer explanations for all questions on the free official practice test.
These are just some of the many exam readiness materials from the College Board. A paper version of the official practice test will be distributed to all high schools in the ™. Students can get this free booklet from their school counselor's office beginning in winter 2004-05.SAT Preparation Booklet
