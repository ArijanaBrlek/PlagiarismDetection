Appraisals & Appraisers
The Museum and museum staff are prohibited from offering valuations, appraisals or authentications for works of art. Appraisals and authentication should be carried out by a certified appraiser or reputable auction house.
You may wish to find an appraiser to determine the value of your artwork. Appraisers are trained specialists who work for a fee. They evaluate your piece and give you a written statement of its value. Although the following organizations do not provide appraisals themselves, they each publish a directory of their members. Always seek an appraiser with an expertise in the type of artwork you own. Appraisers listed in these directories can be found by state and city. You may also find appraisers listed in the Yellow Pages of your local phone directories.
