 Eva's Story
Eva of Indian River County, Florida is 81 years old, widowed and lives alone. She attended a free dinner hosted by an insurance agent with a program on how to better yourself financially. Following the meeting the agent came to Eva's home many times always uninvited. He took her dining and shopping many times. Once he gained her trust and confidence, he convinced her that he was looking out for her best interests. He convinced her to divulge personal information to him. that her investments were inadequate. and she could have more disposable income that she presently had. The agent misrepresented and lied about important information on the annuity. The agent had Eva sign a number of forms he didn't explain to her. He never told her that she would lose substantial cash values or have to pay heavy taxes, or that the agent would earn new commissions from the sale. Even though she exercised her "10-day free look" to return the annuity, the agent came to her house and intimidated her into keeping the policy after-all.

She hired an attorney who fought back and won. You can, too!
Answer “Yes or No” to the following questions to see if an annuity is the right choice for you:Is An Annuity Right For You?
Do you want to defer taxes from your annuity until you can PASS THE TAXABLE INCOME TO YOUR LOVED ONES after you’re gone? Be careful, “tax deferred” can be a double-edged sword.
Do you want to LIMIT your ability to get your own money back even in an emergency situation or else INCUR A SURRENDER CHARGE? (A surrender charge is the penalty the insurance company charges you if you take money out before a certain number of years have passed.) Don’t buy an annuity with more than a 7- year surrender charge.
Do you have PLENTY OF OTHER ASSETS so if you need to access your money in an emergency, you would haven’t to touch your annuity? Never put all your eggs in one basket.
Do you want to put your money in an annuity when you are NEVER TOLD how much the agent earns by suggesting one annuity over another? (How do you know WHY you’ve been recommended one over the other? Can you determine which product is better for you?) Ask for verification of the commissions on each annuity recommended to you.
Do you want to put your money in an annuity where you’ll NEVER SEE THE “CONTRACT” until weeks after you’ve given over your money? (How many other products do you buy a “contract” you’ve never seen until it is too late? Ask to see the exact policy BEFORE you sign an application.)
Do you want to put your money in an annuity where the agent has NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO GIVE YOU TRUTHFUL ANSWERS to your questions? (Note: insurance companies say you have no right to rely on what an agent tells you even if the agent doesn’t tell the truth. They’ll tell you that you must READ THE POLICY, but you don’t get the policy until weeks after you already GAVE YOUR MONEY to them. It’s a catch 22 and you’re the victim. And of course, they won’t say you can’t rely on what an agent says until AFTER you’ve complained that the agent lied to you. Again, ask to see the exact policy BEFORE you sign an application.)
Do you want to put your money in an annuity because you’ve been told it avoids probate? (Unfortunately, annuities are one of the WORST ASSETS to give your love ones because they’ll have to pay income taxes on all the gain in the annuity. Other assets that your loved ones inherit without having to pay your income tax bill are much better for heirs.)
Do you want to buy an annuity that may NOT BE IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS, but will in fact pay the highest commission your agent can earn? (The four insurance companies that pay the highest commissions just happen to be the top four companies with the highest equity indexed sales in the country? Coincidence? I don’t think so.)
Do you want to LOCK UP YOUR MONEY where you can’t access your money without a penalty because the surrender charge lasts longer than you do. (For example, if you’re life expectancy is 10 years, do you want to lock up your money for longer than you’re supposed to live by buying an annuity with a 15-year surrender charge?) Again, don’t purchase an annuity with a surrender charge period that lasts longer than 7 years. Don’t buy an annuity at all if your life expectancy is less than 7 years.
Would you rather put your money in an investment that pays you HIGHER TAXABLE INCOME in retirement than other investments like securities? Withdrawals from annuity earnings are taxed at higher ordinary income rates. However growth in stocks you’ve owned for more than one year are taxed at lower capital gains rates – normally 15%. Pick low risk stocks over annuities if security and stability are important to you.
If you answer “Yes” to any of the above questions, then an annuity may be right for you. However, if you answer “No” to even one of these questions, please think carefully before purchasing an annuity. Seek the guidance of an attorney or CPA (but make sure the CPA doesn’t have a license to sell life insurance or annuities), or visit a “fee only” financial planner. Don’t rely on a “fee-based” financial planner who has a license to sell annuities. Fee-based planners can make recommendations to you and then sell you the very product (i.e., earn a commission) to fit their recommendation. How do you know their advice is impartial and in YOUR best interests?
