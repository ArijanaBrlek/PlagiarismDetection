is a term in spatial analysis.Place syntax
There is great potential in combining geographically oriented accessibility research and geometrically oriented research in architecture, such as , as stated by for example, Jiang et al. The weak representations of the cognitive environment for movement space in current accessibility measures, pointed out by for example Kwan et al, can be reinforced by the concept of the axial line, developed by Hillier et al. The axial line represents how you move and what you can see, which is by nature directional. space syntax [] citation needed [] citation needed [] citation needed [] citation needed
An thereby captures not only the but also, roughly, how it is to navigate in it. The axial map therefore can put local data on plots or places, as used in geographical approaches, in defined geometrical relations or configurations. Seen the other way around, space syntax can be integrated and strengthened with data, in ways not done before. This is what we call Place Syntax, which basically means accessibility with axial lines, i.e. accessibility with visibility. axial map movement grid place [] citation needed
The research group (SAD) at the in , has, together with the Department of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science, developed a new GIS-tool called "" (PST). The tool uses spatial data on plot regions or address points. The axial map with unlinks constitute the grid. Address points also work as links between plot and axial line. Distance (dij) can be constrained as 'turns' (axial steps), walk distance or bird's distance (meter). There are also possibilities to define a function on the distance constraints.

SAD believe that the 'Place syntax' approach and the new GIS-tool has great potential for urban analysis and architectural space design for example in better predicting pedestrian flow and estimating accessibilities based on the experiencing subject, both where the pedestrian can go and what it can see.[] citation needed
