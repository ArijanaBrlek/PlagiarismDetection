Vinyl Accessories
As in many home improvements, the quality of the installation is just as important as the quality of the siding itself. Even the best siding in the world, if installed improperly, won't perform well and won't give you the beautiful and durable home you deserve. The steps we take for professional installation will guaranty that your home looks beautiful and remains beautiful for years to come.
Vinyl provides lasting beauty and design flexibility. Using a variety of siding and soffit styles, colors, accessories and trim, you can update a ranch, add character to a colonial or even recreate a Victorian. Additionally, you can select vinyl siding that will be consistent with your home's design and fit into the environment and neighboring homes.
5 Steps to Beautiful and Home-Transforming Vinyl Siding
1. Choosing Your Siding Contractor
Your home is your biggest investment, and when choosing your contractor, you need to know that they'll take as good of care of your home as you would.
Choose a contractor you feel comfortable with.
Verify that the contractor is insured; ask for a "Certificate of Insurance" showing both liability (for your property) AND worker's compensation (for their workers).
Ask for a list of references and confirm with at least two of them.
Check for home improvement or appropriate contractor's license, such as a Mass HIC License.

And many contractors will tell you they've got 20 or 30 years experience. But why has their company been in business for less than 3 years?Someone who doesn't use contracts
