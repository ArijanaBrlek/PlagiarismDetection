Learning Outcomes Assessment Test for APUS Students
The American Public University System uses a variety of assessment activities designed to document student learning. Degree-seeking students are required to participate in the learning outcomes assessment activities at APUS and will be given adequate notice of course and non-course related assessment activities they are responsible for completing. Assessments are used for the purpose of continuously improving on our academic programs and courses.  The students' survey results are confidential and are used only to inform the University System of performance in a given area.  APUS is committed to protecting the privacy of its students. This includes ensuring the confidentiality of student work submitted for assessment as well as the feedback resulting from assessment activities.
National testing and other assessment are not calculated into the student's grade point average or considered part of the student's academic performance. Completion of the assessment is required prior to the students conferral date; however, those who have not completed the required LOA exam will still maintain their conferral date.  In the event that the student does not complete the assessment, APUS will not issue final transcripts or the diploma until the assessment has been completed.
Currently, national testing required for degree-seeking undergraduate students and MBA candidates include:
