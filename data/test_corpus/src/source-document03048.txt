Habitual Offenders
Failure to make payments can result in any of the following:
Work Release. The non-custodial parent is sent to the county jail and permitted to leave only to go to work.
Income tax return intercept. If the amount owed (called an arrearage) is $150-$500, money may be taken from the non-custodial parent's state or federal income tax return. If the non-custodial parent owes money in back-taxes, child support needs come second to the government's claim.
Credit bureau report. If the amount owed is more than $1,000, it will be reported to the Credit Bureau.
Lien against passport and licenses. If the amount owed is more than $5,000 or payments have not been made for three (3) months, Child Support may issue a lien against the non-custodial parent's passport; $3,000 for professional, sporting or driver's license suspension. A lien may also be issued against an automobile or real estate.
Pursuit of Felony Charges. An arrearage of $5,000 up to $15,000 is considered a Class D felony and may result in a prison sentence of up to 3 years. An arrearage of $15,000 or more is considered a Class C felony and may result in a prison sentence of up to 8 years.
