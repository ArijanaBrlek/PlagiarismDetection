(EPS) Electrophysiology study
If an arrhythmia is detected, various tests may be done to confirm or rule out suspected causes. EPS testing may be done to find the arrhythmia and determine the best treatment, especially if a pacemaker or catheter ablation procedure is being considered.
When an arrhythmia is serious, urgent treatment may be required to restore a normal rhythm. This may include:
Electrical "shock" therapy (defibrillation or cardioversion)
Implanting a temporary pacemaker to interrupt the arrhythmia
Medications given through a vein (intravenous)
Supraventricular arrhythmias may be treated with:
Medications that slow the pulse (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers)
Medications that cause the heart rhythm to return to normal (anti-arrhythmic drugs)
Many supraventricular arrhythmias can be treated and cured with radiofrequency ablation. This avoids the need for lifelong drug therapy.
Increasingly, most ventricular tachycardias are treated with an (ICD). As soon as arrhythmia begins, the ICD sends a shock to stop it, or a burst of pacing activity to override it. implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
Bradycardias that cause symptoms can be treated by implanting a permanent pacemaker.
Outlook (Prognosis) Back to Top
The outcome depends on several factors:
The kind of arrhythmia -- whether it is supraventricular tachycardia, or a more dangerous arrhythmia such as or ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation
The overall pumping ability of the heart (ejection fraction)
Whether you have heart disease (, , valvular heart disease) and how well it can be treated coronary artery disease heart failure
Some types of arrhythmias may be life-threatening if not promptly and properly treated.
With bradycardias treated with a permanent pacemaker, the outlook is usually good.
