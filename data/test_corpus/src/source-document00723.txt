Two of the founders, Mary Stem and Ginny Power, are shown in the picture on this page. Both of these women were actively teaching exercise classes at Senior Neighbors well into their 80s.
Since its inception, Senior Neighbors has been connecting people with resources to ensure their continued health, wellness, vitality, involvement in the community and engagement in life. Our mission to enable older people to maintain an independent lifestyle is as critical today as it was in 1960.
With four senior programming centers and community-based social, arts, education, recreation, health, employment, training and volunteer opportunities, Senior Neighbors is built on partnerships. Our services are supported by the United Way , Allied Arts of Greater Chattanooga , City of Chattanooga , Community Foundation of Greater Chattanooga , City of Soddy-Daisy , Hamilton County , Southeast Area Agency on Aging and Disability , Senior Service America , and Corporation for National and Community Service .
In 2004 AlexianBrothers added Senior Neighbors to their extensive offerings in the Chattanooga area.Our mission to enable older persons to maintain an independent lifestyle for as long as possible made us a natural extension of the existing Alexian Brothers ministries. To achieve our mission we provide a variety of services to enhance the mental, physical and creative well being of older adults, including:
Programming at four community centers, including foreign language classes, dance instruction, art classes, music, card playing, quilting, bingo, health screenings and exercise
