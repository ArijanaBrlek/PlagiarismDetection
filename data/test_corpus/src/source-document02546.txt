Here are the Greatest Mathematicians in chronological (birth-year) order (with larger fonts used for the names of the Top Fifteen and Top Thirty) and some interjected historical notes):  
Earliest mathematicians
Little is known of the earliest mathematics, but the famous from Early Stone-Age Africa has tally marks suggesting arithmetic. The markings include six prime numbers (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) in order, though this is probably coincidence.Ishango Bone
The advanced artifacts of Egypt's Old Kingdom and the Indus-Harrapa civilization imply strong mathematical skill, but the first written evidence of advanced arithmetic dates from Sumeria, where 4500-year old clay tablets show multiplication and division problems; the first abacus may be about this old. By 3600 years ago, Mesopotamian tablets show tables of squares, cubes, reciprocals, and even logarithms, using a primitive place-value system (in base 60, not 10). Babylonians were familiar with the Pythagorean theorem, quadratic equations and even cubic equations (though they didn't have a general solution for these).
Also at least 3600 years ago, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes produced a famous manuscript (now called the ), claiming it to be a copy of an even older text. It showed simple algebra methods and included a table giving optimal expressions using Egyptian fractions. (Today, Egyptian fractions lead to challenging number theory problems with no practical applications, but they may have had practical value for the Egyptians. To divide 17 grain bushels among 21 workers, the equation 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/7 has practical value, especially when compared with the "greedy" decomposition 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/17 + 1/1428.)Rhind Papyrus
Early Vedic mathematicians
The greatest mathematics before the Golden Age of Greece was in India's early Vedic (Hindu) civilization. The Vedics understood relationships between geometry and arithmetic, developed astronomy, astrology, calendars, and used mathematical forms in some religious rituals. (Ancient China also developed mathematics, but little written evidence survives prior to Chang Tshang's famous book.)
The earliest mathematician to whom definite teachings can be ascribed was Lagadha, who apparently lived about 1300 BC. He used geometry and elementary trigonometry for his astronomy. Another famous early Vedic mathematician was Apastamba, who lived slightly before Pythagoras, did work in geometry, advanced arithmetic, and may have proved the Pythagorean Theorem. Other Vedic mathematicians solved quadratic and simultaneous equations.

(ca 625 - 546 BC) Greece of MiletusThales
Thales was the "Chief" of the "Seven Sages" of ancient Greece, and he is often called the "Father of Science" or the "First Philosopher." Thales is believed to have studied mathematics under Egyptians, who in turn were aware of much older mathematics from Mesopotamia. Several fundamental theorems about triangles are attributed to Thales, including the law of similar triangles (which Thales used famously to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid) and the fact that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
Thales was also an astronomer; he invented the 365-day calendar and is the first person known to have correctly predicted a solar eclipse. His theories of physics would seem quaint today, but he seems to have been the first to describe magnetism and static electricity. Thales was also a famous politician, ethicist, and military strategist. Aristotle said, "To Thales the primary question was not what do we know, but how do we know it."
Thales' writings have not survived and are known only second-hand. His famous theorems of geometry were already known in ancient Babylon, so his importance derives from his founding of Greek science. His student and successor was Anaximander, famous for astronomy, cartography and sundials, and who is sometimes called the "First Scientist" since his theories were based on experimentation and logic rather than Thales' animistic interpretations. Anaximander's most famous student, in turn, was Pythagoras.
Top
(ca 575-505 BC) Greece of SamosPythagoras
Pythagoras studied under Anaximander, Egyptians, Babylonians, and the mystic Pherekydes (from whom Pythagoras acquired a belief in reincarnation); he became the most influential of early Greek mathematicians. He is credited with being first to use axioms and deductive proofs, so his influence on Plato and Euclid may be enormous. (Perhaps his historical importance should rank him higher on our list, but no writings of the Pythagoreans survive and what is known is reported second-hand, and possibly exaggerated, by Plato and others.) He and his students (the "Pythagoreans") were ascetic mystics for whom mathematics was partly a spiritual tool; Pythagoras is sometimes called the "First Philosopher." It is reported that Pythagoras proposed that the Earth is round (and perhaps that it rotates around the Sun), and believed thinking was located in the brain rather than heart. His famous students included Philolaus of Croton, the natural philosopher Empedocles, and Pythagoras' female successor Theano (she may also have been his wife) -- the Pythagoreans were one of the few ancient schools to admit women.
Pythagoras discovered that harmonious intervals in music are based on simple rational numbers. This led to a fascination with integers and mystic numerology; he is sometimes called the "Father of Numbers" and once said "Number rules the universe." (About the mathematical basis of music, Leibniz later wrote, "Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting." Other mathematicians who investigated the arithmetic of music included Huygens, Euler and Simon Stevin.)
The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras, but he is often credited with the first . (But Apastamba proved it in India at about the same time, and some historians believe Pythagoras journeyed to India and learned of the proof there.) He also discovered the simple parametric form of Pythagorean triplets (xx-yy, 2xy, xx+yy). Other discoveries of the Pythagorean school include the golden ratio (attributed to Theano), and irrational numbers (attributed to Hippasus). It is said that the discovery of irrational numbers upset the Pythagoreans so much they tossed Hippasus into the ocean!proof
The famous successors of Thales and Pythagoras included Zeno of Elea (ca 495-435 BC), Plato of Athens (ca 428-348 BC), Theaetetus (ca 414-369 BC), and Archytas (friend of Plato, inventor of pulley). These early Greeks ushered in a Golden Age of Mathematics and Philosophy unequaled in Europe until the Renaissance. The emphasis was on pure, rather than practical, mathematics. Plato (who ranks #40 on Michael Hart's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History) decreed that his scholars should do geometric construction solely with compass and straight-edge rather than with "carpenter's tools" like rulers and protractors.

(408-355 BC) Asia Minor, Greece of CnidusEudoxus
Eudoxus journeyed widely for his education, despite that he was not wealthy, studying mathematics with Archytas in Tarentum, medicine with Philiston in Sicily, philosophy with Plato in Athens, continuing his mathematics study in Egypt, touring the Eastern Mediterranean with his own students and finally returned to Cnidus where he established himself as astronomer and physician. What is known of him is second-hand, through the writings of Euclid and others, but he seems to have been one of the great mathematicians of the ancient world.
Many of the theorems in Euclid's were first proved by Eudoxus. While Pythagoras had been horrified by the discovery of irrational numbers, Eudoxus is famous for incorporating them into arithmetic. He also developed the earliest techniques of the infinitesimal calculus. Eudoxus (or Pythagoras?) was the first person known to have recognized that the Earth rotates around the Sun.Elements
Four of Eudoxus' most famous discoveries were the volume of a cone, extension of arithmetic to the irrationals, summing formula for geometric series, and viewing as the limit of polygonal perimeters. None of these seems difficult today, but it does seem remarkable that they were all first achieved by the same man. Eudoxus has been quoted as saying "Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape, its size and its substance."π

(ca 322-275 BC) Greece/Egypt of Megara & AlexandriaEuclid
Euclid may have been a student of Aristotle. He founded the school of mathematics at the great university of Alexandria. He was the first to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, proved the unique factorization theorem ("Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic"), and established the relationship between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. Among several books attributed to him are (a mathematical discussion of music), , (a treatise on the theory of mirrors), and his comprehensive math textbook . Several of his masterpieces have been lost, including works on conic sections and other advanced geometric topics. Apparently Desargues' Homology Theorem (a pair of triangles is coaxial if and only if it is copolar) was proved in one of these lost works; this is the fundamental theorem which initiated the study of projective geometry. Euclid is also believed to have proved that there are only five "Platonic" solids. Euclid ranks #14 on Michael Hart's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History. introduced the notions of axiom and theorem. It was used as a textbook for 2000 years and in fact is still the basis for high school geometry, making Euclid the leading mathematics teacher of all time. Some think his best inspiration was recognizing that the Parallel Postulate must be an axiom rather than a theorem.The Division of the ScaleThe OpticsThe CartoptricsThe ElementsThe Elements

(287-212 BC) Greece of SyracuseArchimedes
Archimedes studied at Euclid's school (probably after Euclid's death), but his work far surpassed the works of Euclid. Archimedes made advances in number theory and algebra, but his greatest contributions were in geometry. His most remarkable construction was the "squaring of the parabola", much more difficult than the angle trisection for which he is also famous. (His angle trisection requires a straightedge.) His achievements are particularly impressive given the lack of good mathematical notation in his day.markable
Archimedes' methods anticipated both the integral and differential calculus. His original achievements in physics include the principles of leverage, the first law of hydrostatics, and inventions like the compound pulley, the hydraulic screw, and war machines. His books include , , , , and . Archimedes proved that the volume of a sphere is two-thirds the volume of a circumscribing cylinder. He requested that a representation of such a sphere and cylinder be inscribed on his tomb.Floating BodiesSpiralsThe Sand ReckonerMeasurement of the CircleSphere and Cylinder
Recently, modern technology has led to the discovery of new writings by Archimedes, hitherto hidden on a palimpsest, including a note that implies an understanding of the distinction between countable and uncountable infinities (a distinction which wasn't resolved until Georg Cantor, who lived 2300 years after the time of Archimedes). Archimedes is widely agreed to be the greatest mathematician ever, though his historical importance is diminished somewhat in that he was far ahead of his time.too
Top
(262-190 BC) Greece of PergaApollonius
Apollonius, called "The Great Geometer," is widely considered to be the second-greatest of ancient mathematicians, behind only Archimedes. His writings on conic sections have been studied until modern times; he invented the names for parabola, hyperbola and ellipse; he developed methods for normals and curvature. Although astronomers eventually concluded it was not physically correct, Apollonius developed the ancient model of planetary orbits, and proved important theorems in this area. He deliberately emphasized the beauty of pure, rather than applied, mathematics, saying his theorems were "worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves."
Since many of his works have survived only in a fragmentary form, several great modern mathematicians, including Fermat, have enjoyed reconstructing and reproving his "lost" theorems. (Among these, the most famous is to construct a circle tangent to three other circles.)
In evaluating the genius of the ancient Greeks, it is well to remember that their achievements were made without the convenience of modern notation. It is clear from his writing that Apollonius almost developed the analytic geometry of Descartes, but failed due to the lack of such elementary concepts as negative numbers. Leibniz wrote "He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less the achievements of the foremost men of later times."

Mathematicians after Classical Greece
Greece was eventually absorbed into the Roman Empire (with Archimedes himself famously killed by a Roman soldier); Rome did not pursue pure science as Greece had, and eventually Europe fell into a Dark Age. The Greek emphasis on pure mathematics and proofs was key to the future of mathematics, but they were missing an even more important catalyst: a decimal place-value system based on zero and nine other symbols. (It's still hard to believe that this "obvious" and so-convenient system didn't catch on in Europe until almost the Renaissance.)
No one person can be credited with the invention of the decimal system, but Chang Tshang, Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta and Leonardo Fibonacci are key figures.

(ca 200-142 BC) China Chang Tshang
Chinese mathematicians excelled for thousands of years, and were first to discover various algebraic and geometric principles, but they are denied credit because of Western ascendancy. Although there were great Chinese mathematicians a thousand years before the Han Dynasty, and innovations continued for centuries after Han, the textbook has special importance. (known in Chinese as or ) was apparently written during the early Han Dynasty (about 165 BC) by Chang Tshang (also spelled Zhang Cang).Nine Chapters on the Mathematical ArtNine ChaptersJiu Zhang Suan ShuChiu Chang Suan Shu
Many of the mathematical concepts of the early Greeks were discovered independently in early China. Chang's book gives methods of arithmetic (including cube roots) and algebra (including matrix-based solution of simultaneous equations), mentions infinitesimals and limits, uses the decimal system with zero and negative numbers, uses Cavalieri's Principle of solid geometry, proves the Pythagorean Theorem, and includes a clever geometric proof that the perimeter of a right triangle times the radius of its inscribing circle equals the area of its circumscribing rectangle. (Some of this may have been added after the time of Chang.)
was probably based on earlier books, lost during the great book burning of 212 BC, so Chang himself may not have been the major creative genius. Moreover, important revisions and commentaries were added after Chang, notably by Liu Hui (ca 220-280). But even if we suppose Chang was a mere copyist, his book had immense historical importance. It was the dominant Chinese mathematical text for centuries, and had great influence throughout the Far East. After Chang, Chinese mathematics continued to flourish, discovering trigonometry, matrix methods, the binomial theorem, etc. Some of the teachings made their way to India, and from there to the Islamic world and Europe. There is some evidence that the Hindus borrowed the decimal system itself from books like .Nine ChaptersNine Chapters

(ca 300) Egypt, Greece of AlexandriaPappus
Pappus may have been the greatest Western mathematician during the 14 centuries that separated Apollonius and Fibonacci. He wrote about arithmetic methods, plane and solid geometry, the axiomatic method, celestial motions and mechanics. In addition to his own original research, his texts are noteworthy for preserving works of earlier mathematicians that would otherwise have been lost.
Pappus presents several ingenious geometric theorems including Desargues' Homology Theorem (which Pappus attributes to Euclid), a special case of Pascal's Hexagram Theorem, and Pappus' Theorem itself (two projective pencils can always be brought into a perspective position). For these theorems, Pappus is sometimes called the "Father of Projective Geometry." Other ingenious theorems include an angle trisection method using a fixed hyperbola. He stated (but didn't prove) the , also writing "Bees know this fact which is useful to them, that the hexagon ... will hold more honey for the same material than [a square or triangle]."Isoperimetric Theorem
For preserving the teachings of Euclid and Apollonius, as well as his own theorems of geometry, Pappus certainly belongs on a list of great ancient mathematicians. But these teachings lay dormant during Europe's Dark Ages, diminishing Pappus' historical significance.

(476-550) Ashmaka & Kusumapura (India) Aryabhatta
Indian mathematicians excelled for thousands of years, and eventually even developed advanced techniques like Taylor series before Europeans did, but they are denied credit because of Western ascendancy. Among the Hindu mathematicians, Aryabhatta is probably most famous.
While Europe was in its early "Dark Age," Aryabhatta advanced arithmetic and algebra, using the decimal system; he developed continued fractions; he anticipated elementary calculus. Aryabhatta is sometimes considered the "Father of Algebra" instead of al-Khowarizmi (who himself cites the work of Aryabhatta). He is credited with the for solving Diophantine equations, and may have been first to introduce the constant .Aryabhatta Algorithme
Aryabhatta's name is closely associated with trigonometry: he may have been the first to introduce inverse trig functions and spherical trigonometry. He calculated improved approximations for and trig functions.π
Aryabhatta independently concluded that the planets rotate around the Sun but, unlike Eudoxus, realized the orbits were ellipses rather than circles.

(589-668) Rajasthan (India) `Bhillamalacarya'Brahmagupta
No one person gets unique credit for the invention of the decimal system but Brahmagupta's textbook was most influential, and is sometimes considered the first textbook "to treat zero as a number in its own right." It also treated negative numbers. (Others claim these were first seen 800 years earlier in Chang Tshang's Chinese text and were implicit in what survives of Aryabhatta's work, but Brahmagupta's text discussed them lucidly.)Brahmasphutasiddhanta
Brahmagupta Bhillamalacarya (`The Teacher from Bhillamala') made great advances in arithmetic, algebra, numeric analysis, and geometry. Several theorems bear his name, including the formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, which can be written:         Another famous Brahmagupta theorem dealing with such quadrilaterals can be phrased "In a circle, if the chords AB and CD are perpendicular and intersect at E, then the line from E which bisects AC will be perpendicular to BD." Proving Brahmagupta's theorems are good challenges even today.
16 A = (a+b+c-d)(a+b-c+d)(a-b+c+d)(-a+b+c+d)2
In addition to his famous writings on practical mathematics and his ingenious theorems of geometry, Brahmagupta solved the general quadratic equation, and worked on Diophantine and Pell's equations. He proved Brahmagupta's identity (the set of sums of two squares is closed under multiplication). He applied mathematics to astronomy, predicting eclipses, etc.

(ca 780-850) Persia, Iraq Muhammed `Abu Jafar' ibn Musâal-Khowârizmi
Al-Khowarizmi was a Persian who worked as a mathematician, astronomer and geographer early in the Golden Age of Islamic science. He introduced the Hindu decimal system to the Islamic world and Europe. He wrote the book , which demonstrated simple algebra and geometry, and several other influential books including ones on calculating with the decimal system, trigonometry, geography, astronomy, the Hebrew calendar, etc. The word is borrowed from Al-Khowarizmi's name. Among several Muslim mathematicians who contributed to the development of Islamic science, and indirectly to Europe's later Renaissance, Al-Khowarizmi was the most famous and most influential.Al-Jabralgorithm

(ca 1048-1130) Persia Omaral-Khayyám
Khayyam did clever work with geometry, developing an alternate to Euclid's Parallel Postulate and then deriving the parallel result using theorems based on the . He derived solutions to cubic equations using the intersection of conic sections with circles. Remarkably, he stated that the cubic solution could not be achieved with straightedge and compass, a fact that wouldn't be proved until the 19th century. Khayyam did even more important work in algebra, writing an influential textbook, and developing new solutions for various higher-degree equations. He discovered the binomial coefficients. His symbol ('shay') for an unknown in an algebraic equation was transliterated to become our 'x'.Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral
Khayyam was also an important astronomer, measuring the year far more accurately than ever before, improving the Persian calendar, and building a famous star map. He emphasized science over religion and proved that the Earth rotates around the Sun. Despite his great achievements in algebra, geometry, and astronomy, today Omar al-Khayyam is most famous for his rich poetry ().The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam

(1114-1185) India ÁcháryaBháscara
Bhascara (often called Bhaskara II) may have been the greatest of the Hindu mathematicians. He made achievements in several fields of mathematics including some Europe wouldn't learn until the time of Euler. His textbooks dealt with many matters, including solid geometry, combinations, and advanced arithmetic methods. He was also an astronomer, and wrote a comprehensive textbook on planetary motions that would not be equalled in Europe for many centuries. In algebra, he solved various equations including 2nd-order Diophantine, quartic, Brouncker's and Pell's equations; some of his solutions were superior to those discovered in 17th century Europe. In analysis he took derivatives of polynomial and trigonometric functions, used Rolle's Theorem, and anticipated integral calculus. In trigonometry, which he valued for its own beauty as well as practical applications, he developed spherical trig and was first to present the identity    
(a + b) = (a)(b) + (b)(a)sinsincossincos
Bhascara's achievements exceeded all but the very greatest European mathematicians, and came centuries earlier. It is an open riddle of history whether any of Bhascara's teachings trickled into Europe in time to influence its Scientific Renaissance.

(ca 1170-1245) Italy PisanoLeonardo `Fibonacci'
Leonardo (known today as Fibonacci) introduced new methods of arithmetic to Europe, and relayed the mathematics of the Hindus, Persians, and Arabs. Others had translated Islamic mathematics, e.g. the works of al-Khowarizmi, into Latin, but Leonardo was the influential teacher. He re-introduced older Greek ideas like Mersenne numbers and Diophantine equations, and made original contributions in geometry and number theory. His writings cover a broad range including methods to construct and convert Egyptian fractions (which were still in wide use), irrational numbers, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, theorems about Pythagorean triples, and the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .... which is now linked with the name Fibonacci.
Leonardo provided Europe with the decimal system, algebra and the 'lattice' method of multiplication, all far superior to the methods then in use. His clever notation for quantities like is more efficient than today's notation. It seems hard to believe but before the decimal system, mathematicians had no notation for zero. Referring to this system, Gauss was later to exclaim "To what heights would science now be raised if Archimedes had made that discovery!" In addition to having perhaps the greatest historical importance of any European mathematician throughout the 19 centuries separating Archimedes and Descartes, Leonardo `Fibonacci' has been called "the most mathematician of the Middle Ages."5 yards, 2 feet, and 3 inchestalented
Many histories describe him as bringing Islamic mathematics to Europe, but in Fibonacci's own preface to , he specifically credits the Hindus:Liber Abaci
... as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; ... But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus. Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art, I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, ...
Had the Scientific Renaissance begun in the Islamic Empire, someone like al-Khowarizmi would have much greater historic significance than Fibonacci, but the Renaissance did happen in Europe. 's summary of the decimal system has been called "the most important sentence ever written." Even granting this to be an exaggeration, there is no doubt that the Scientific Revolution owes a huge debt to Leonardo `Fibonacci' Pisano.Liber Abaci

Madhava, also known as Irinjaatappilly Madhavan Namboodiri, is considered the founder of the important Kerala school of mathematics and astronomy. If everything credited to him was his own work, he was a truly great mathematician. His analytic geometry preceded and surpassed Descartes', and included differentiation and integration. He also did work with continued fractions, trigonometry, and geometry.

(1501-1576) Italy GirolamoCardano
Cardano was a highly respected physician and was first to describe typhoid fever. He was also an accomplished gambler and chess player and wrote an early book on probability. He was also a remarkable inventor: the combination lock, the gimbal, a ciphering tool, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints are all his inventions and are in use to this day. He made contributions to physics; he noted that projectile trajectories are parabolas, and may have been first to note the impossibility of perpetual motion machines. He did work in philosophy, geology, hydrodynamics, music; he wrote books on medicine and an encyclopedia of natural science.
But Cardano is most remembered for his achievements in mathematics. He was first to publish general solutions to cubic and quartic equations (though these were largely based on others' work). He introduced complex numbers, although he did not develop their theory further. He introduced binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem, and introduced and solved the geometric hypocyloid problem.
Cardano's life had tragic elements. Throughout his life he was tormented that his father (a friend of Leonardo da Vinci) married Cardano's mother only after Cardano was born. His reputation for gambling and aggression interfered with his career. His son apparently murdered his own wife. Cardano practiced astrology and was imprisoned for heresy when he cast a horoscope for Jesus. Leibnniz wrote of Cardano: "Cardano was a great man with all his faults; without them, he would have been incomparable."

(1596-1650) France RenéDéscartes
Descartes' early career was that of soldier-adventurer and he finished as tutor to royalty, but in between he achieved fame as the preeminent intellectual of his day. He invented analytic geometry and is therefore called the "Father of Modern Mathematics." Because of his famous philosophical writings ("Cogito ergo sum") he is considered, along with Aristotle, to be one of the most influential thinkers in history. (He ranks #49 on Michael Hart's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History.) Descartes made important contributions to physics (e.g. the law of conservation of momentum), and mathematical notation (e.g. the use of superscripts to denote exponents). His famous mathematical theorems include the Rule of Signs (for determining the signs of polynomial roots), the elegant formula relating the radii of , and an improvement on the ancient construction method for cube-doubling.Soddy kissing circles
Descartes has an extremely high reputation and would be ranked much higher by most list makers. I've demoted him partly because he had only insulting things to say about Pascal and Fermat, each of whom was more brilliant at mathematics than Descartes. (Some even suspect that Descartes arranged the destruction of Pascal's lost .) Anyway, the historical importance of these Frenchmen may be somewhat exaggerated since others, e.g. the Italian, Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647), were also on the verge of developing modern mathematics.Essay on Conics

(1601-1665) France Pierre de Fermat
Fermat was a lawyer and government official; mathematics was his hobby, yet he made very major advances in both continuous and discrete mathematics, and practically founded modern number theory. Fermat is most remembered for , ubiquitous in number theory, and for his conjectured , but he did much other work as well. Much of his work was never published and there are several important theorems attributed to him for which proofs had to be rediscovered; among these is that any prime (4n+1) can be represented as the sum of two squares in exactly one way. (Fermat records that he proved this with difficulty using his method of "infinite descent." Because of the "Last Theorem", which was actually just a private scribble, many wrongly suppose that Fermat's work abounds with false or unproven conjectures.)Fermat's Little TheoremFermat's Last Theorem
Fermat developed a system of analytic geometry which both preceded and surpassed that of Descartes; he developed methods of differential and integral calculus which Newton acknowledged as an inspiration. Solving     to find extrema of is perhaps the most useful idea in applied mathematics; this technique originated with Fermat. In collaboration with Blaise Pascal, Fermat founded the theory of probability. Fermat anticipated the principle of least action, which Lagrange and Hamilton would later develop, and used it to establish basic principles of optics.f'(x) = 0f(x)
Some will think I've ranked Fermat too high, but he had great historic importance for both calculus and number theory. Fellow geniuses are the best judges of genius, and Blaise Pascal had this to say of Fermat: "For my part, I confess that [Fermat's researches about numbers] are far beyond me, and I am competent only to admire them."
Fermat's contemporaneous rival Rene Descartes is more famous than Fermat, and Descartes' writings were more influential. Whatever one thinks of Descartes as a , however, it seems clear that Fermat was the better . Fermat and Descartes independently discovered analytic geometry, but it was Fermat who extended it to more than 2 dimensions, and followed up by developing elementary calculus. Fermat and Descartes did work in physics and independently discovered the (trigonometric) law of refraction, but only Fermat had the insight to realize that the refraction law implied that light has a finite speed !philosophermathematician

(1623-1662) France BlaisePascal
Pascal was an outstanding genius who studied geometry as a child. At the age of sixteen he stated and proved Pascal's Theorem, a fact relating any six points on any conic section. The Theorem is sometimes called the "Cat's Cradle" or the "Mystic Hexagram." Pascal followed up this result by showing that each of Apollonius' famous theorems about conic sections was a corollary of the Mystic Hexagram; along with Gerard Desargues (1591-1661), he was a key pioneer of projective geometry. Returning to geometry late in life, Pascal advanced the theory of the cycloid. In addition to his work in classic and projective geometry, he founded probability theory, made contributions to axiomatic theory, and the invention of calculus. His name is associated with the Pascal's Triangle of combinatorics and Pascal's Wager in theology.
Like most of the greatest mathematicians, Pascal was interested in physics and mechanics, studying fluids, explaining vacuum, and inventing the syringe and hydraulic press. At the age of eighteen he designed and built the world's first automatic adding machine. (Although he continued to refine this invention, it was never a commercial success.)
Pascal abandoned mathematics for religion, suffered poor health, and died at an early age.

(1629-1695) Holland, France ChristiaanHuygens
Christiaan Huygens (or Hugens or Huyghens) was one of the greatest scientists during Europe's Renaissance. He was an excellent mathematician, but is more famous for his physical theories and inventions. He developed laws of motion before Newton, including the inverse-square law of gravitation, centripetal force, treatment of solid bodies rather than point approximations; he corrected a deficiency in Descartes' law of momentum conservation. He advanced the wave ("undulatory") theory of light, a key concept being , that each point on a wave front acts as a new source of radiation. (Because of Newton's high reputation and corpuscular theory of light, Huygens' superior wave theory was largely ignored for almost two centuries.) His optical discoveries include explanations for polarization and phenomena like haloes.Huygen's Principle
Huygens is famous for his inventions of clocks and lenses. He designed the first reliable pendulum clock, and the first balance spring watch, which he presented to his patron, King Louis XIV of France. He invented superior lens grinding techniques, the achromatic eye-piece, and the best telescope of his day. He was himself a famous astronomer: he discovered Titan and was first to properly describe Saturn's rings and the Orion Nebula. He also designed, but never built, an internal combustion engine. He promoted the use of 31-tone music: a 31-tone organ was in use in Holland as late as the 20th century. Huygens was an excellent card player, billiard player, horse rider, and wrote a book speculating about extra-terrestrial life.
As a mathematician, Huygens did brilliant work in geometry and analysis, proving theorems about conic sections, the cycloid and the catenary. He was first to show that the cycloid solves the tautochrone problem; he used this fact to design an (impractical) compound pendulum clock that would be more accurate than an ordinary pendulum clock. He was first to find the flaw in Saint-Vincent's then-famous circle-squaring method; Huygens himself solved some related quadrature problems. He introduced the concepts of evolute and involute. His friendships with Descartes, Pascal, Mersenne and others helped inspire his mathematics; Huygens in turn was mentor and inspiration to Gottfried Leibniz. At Pascal's urging, he published the first real textbook on probability theory; Huygens also became the first practicing actuary.
Huygens had tremendous creativity, historical importance, and depth and breadth of genius, making him a prime candidate for this List, despite that his emphasis was physics rather than pure mathematics.

Seki Takakazu was a self-taught prodigy who developed a new notation for algebra, and made several discoveries before Western mathematicians did; these include determinants, the Newton-Raphson method, Newton's interpolation formula, Bernoulli numbers, discriminants, methods of calculus, and probably much that has been forgotten (Japanese schools practiced secrecy). He calculated to ten decimal places using Aitkin's method (rediscovered in the 20th century). He also worked with magic squares. He is remembered as a brilliant genius and very influential teacher.π
Seki's work was not propagated to Europe, so has minimal historic importance; otherwise Seki might rank high on our list.

(1642-1727) England Isaac  (Sir) Newton
Newton was an industrious lad who built marvelous toys. His genius seems to have blossomed at about age 22 when, on leave from University, he began revolutionary advances in mathematics, optics, dynamics, thermodynamics, acoustics and celestial mechanics. (Newton's other intellectual interests included chemistry, theology, astrology and alchemy.) Although this list is concerned only with mathematics, Newton's greatness is indicated by the wide range of physical principles he was first to enunciate, including gravitation, and the idea that white light is a mixture of all the rainbow's colors. Newton also designed the first reflecting telescope, first reflecting microscope, and the sextant.
Although others also developed the techniques independently, Newton is regarded as the Father of Calculus (what he called the "method of fluxions"); his most crucial insight being what is now called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (that integration and differentiation are each other's inverse operation). He applied calculus to solve a variety of problems: finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves and the maxima and minima of functions. In addition to several other important advances in analytic geometry, his mathematical works include the Binomial Theorem, his eponymous numeric method, the idea of polar coordinates, and power series for exponential and trigonometric functions. (His equation     has been called the "most important series in mathematics.") He contributed to algebra and the theory of equations, proving facts about cubic equations, attempting generalization of Descartes' rule of signs, etc. He proved that same-mass spheres of any radius have equal gravitational attraction, a key to celestial motions.= x / k!exsumk
Newton is so famous for his calculus, optics and laws of motion, it is easy to overlook that he was also one of the greatest geometers. Among many marvelous theorems, he proved several about quadrilaterals and their in- or circumscribing ellipses, and constructed the parabola defined by four given points. An anecdote often cited to demonstrate his brilliance is the problem of the , which had baffled the best mathematicians in Europe, and came to Newton's attention late in life. He solved it in a few hours and published the answer anonymously. But on seeing the solution Johann Bernoulli immediately exclaimed "I recognize the lion by his footprint."brachistochrone
In 1687 Newton published  , surely the greatest scientific book ever written. The motion of the planets was not understood before Newton, although the system allowed Kepler to describe the orbits. In Newton analyzed the consequences of his Laws of Motion and introduced the Law of Universal Gravitation. The notion that the Earth rotated about the Sun was introduced in ancient Greece, but Newton explained it did, and the Great Scientific Revolution began.Philosophiae Naturalis Principia MathematicaheliocentricPrincipiawhy
Newton ranks #2 on Michael Hart's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History. (Muhammed the Prophet of Allah is #1.) Whatever the criteria, Newton would certainly rank at the top on any list of physicists, or scientists in general, but I've placed him behind Archimedes on this list: his emphasis was physics not mathematics, and Leibniz's contribution lessens the historical importance of Newton's calculus. A comment by Leibniz, however, persuades me to rank Newton near the top: Despite being a rival for the title of , Leibniz once wrote "Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time when Newton lived, what he has done is much the better part."Inventor of Calculus

(1646-1716) Germany Gottfried Wilhelm  Leibniz
As with Fermat, mathematics was a sideline for Leibniz, who was an historian, philosopher, and lawyer. He and Newton were the two undisputed great intellects of their era, and Leibniz might be remembered with a great awe if he had devoted himself to pure science.
Despite that his mathematics was a self-taught hobby, Leibniz was the leading pioneer of all three major branches of modern mathematics: the continuous, the discrete, and the symbolic. Leibniz's contribution to calculus was probably more influential than Newton's: Newton kept his results secret until after Leibniz published, and Leibniz's superior notation is used to this day.
While Leibniz didn't produce as much math as others on the list, and made several blunders in his own development of the laws of motion, he did do some brilliant work. He invented the concepts of matrix determinant and geometric envelope; he designed the first calculator that could do multiplication; and he discovered and proved the striking identity:         (This identity was independently discovered by others including, perhaps, Madhava three centuries earlier.)

(1707-1783) Switzerland Leonhard Euler
Euler made decisive contributions in all areas of mathematics; he gave the world modern trigonometry. Just as Archimedes extended Euclid's geometry to marvelous heights, so Euler took marvelous advantage of the analysis of Newton and Leibniz. Although he emphasized pure mathematics, Euler made important advances in mathematical physics. He was the most prolific mathematician in history and the best algorist. His colleagues called him "Analysis Incarnate." (Laplace, famous for denying credit to fellow mathematicians, once said "Read Euler: he is our master in everything.")
Euler was supreme at discrete mathematics, as well as continuous: He invented graph theory and generating functions. Two of the most important advances in 18th century were Lagrange's calculus of variations and Fourier's spectral series: in each case the key initial discovery was actually Euler's. Euler was also first to prove several interesting theorems of geometry, including facts about the ; relationships among a triangle's altitudes, medians, and circumscribing and inscribing circles; and an expression for a tetrahedron's area in terms of its sides. He was a major figure in number theory, proving the divergence of the sum of prime reciprocals, finding the largest then-known prime, proving that all even perfect numbers must have the Mersenne number form that Euclid had discovered 2000 years earlier, and much more. On a lighter note he constructed a particularly "magical" magic square! Euler ranks #77 on Michael Hart's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History.9-point Feuerbach circle
Four of the most important constant symbols in mathematics (, , = (-1), and = 0.57721566...) were all introduced or popularized by Euler. He is particularly famous for unifying the trigonometric and exponential functions with the equation:   .πeisqrtγ= x + xexicosisin
Euler combined his brilliance with phenomenal concentration. He developed the first method to estimate the Moon's orbit (the three-body problem which had stumped Newton), and he settled an arithmetic dispute involving 50 decimal places of a long convergent series. Both these feats were accomplished when he was totally blind. (About this he said "Now I will have less distraction.")
As a young man, Euler discovered and proved the following:         This striking identity catapulted Euler to instant fame, since the right-side infinite sum was a famous unsolved problem of the day.

(1736-1813) Italy/France Joseph-Louis (Comte de) Lagrange
Lagrange was a brilliant man who advanced to become a teen-age Professor shortly after first studying mathematics. He excelled in all fields of analysis and number theory; he made key contributions to the theories of determinants, continued fractions, and many other fields. He invented partial differential equations, and the calculus of variations. He proved a fundamental Theorem of Group Theory, as well as two number theory theorems of great historic interest: Wilson's prime-number theorem, and the fact that every positive integer is the sum of four squares. He laid the foundations for the theory of polynomial equations which Cauchy, Abel, Galois and Poincaré would later complete.
Lagrange's many contributions to physics include understanding of vibrations (he found an error in Newton's work and published the definitive treatise on sound), celestial mechanics (including an explanation of why the Moon keeps the same face pointed towards the Earth), the (which Hamilton compared to poetry), and the discovery of the Lagrangian points (e.g., in Jupiter's orbit). Lagrange's textbooks were noted for clarity and inspired most of the 19th century mathematicians on this list. Unlike Newton, who used calculus to derive his results but then worked backwards to create geometric proofs for publication, Lagrange relied only on analysis. "No diagrams will be found in this work" he wrote in the preface to his masterpiece .principle of least actionMécanique analytique
Both W.W.R. Ball and E.T. Bell, renowned mathematical historians, bypass Euler to name Lagrange as "the Greatest Mathematician of the 18th Century."

(1746-1818) France GaspardMonge
Gaspard Monge, son of a humble peddler, was an industrious and creative inventor who astounded early with his genius, becoming a professor of physics at age 16. As a military engineer he developed the new field of descriptive geometry, so useful to engineering that it was kept a military secret for 15 years. Monge eventually became a close friend and companion of Napoleon Bonaparte, and demonstrated great courage on several occasions. Monge is most famous for laying the foundation for differential geometry. He also did work in discrete math, and differential equations, and anticipated Poncelet's Principle of Continuity. Monge's most famous theorems of geometry are the "Three Circles Theorem" and "Four Spheres Theorem." While his work in descriptive geometry has little interest to pure mathematics, his application of calculus to the curvature of surfaces inspired Gauss and eventually Riemann.
Monge was an inspirational teacher whose students included Fourier, Sophie Germain, Chasles, Brianchon, Ampere, Carnot, Poncelet and several other famous mathematicians. Chasles reports that Monge never drew figures in his lectures, but could make "the most complicated forms appear in space ... with no other aid than his hands, whose movements admirably supplemented his words." The contributions of Poncelet may be more important than those of Monge, but Monge demonstrated great genius as an untutored child, while Poncelet's skills probably developed due to his great teacher. The great Lagrange said "With [Monge's] application of analysis to geometry this devil of a man will make himself immortal."

(1749-1827) France Pierre-Simon (Marquis de) Laplace
Laplace was the preeminent mathematical astronomer, and is often called the "French Newton." His masterpiece was which redeveloped and improved Newton's work on planetary motions using calculus. While Newton had shown that the two-body gravitation problem led to orbits which were ellipses (or other conic sections), Laplace was more interested in the much more difficult problems involving three or more bodies. (Would Jupiter's pull on Saturn eventually propel Saturn into a closer orbit, or was Saturn's orbit stable for eternity?) Laplace's equations had the optimistic outcome that the solar system was stable.Mecanique Celeste
Laplace advanced the nebular hypothesis of solar system origin, and was first to conceive of black holes and multiple galaxies. He explained the so-called secular acceleration of the Moon. (Today we know Laplace's theories do not fully explain the Moon's path, nor guarantee orbit stability.) His other accomplishments in physics include theories about the speed of sound and surface tension. He was noted for his strong belief in determinism, famously replying to Napoleon's question about God with: "I have no need of that hypothesis."
Laplace viewed mathematics as just a tool for developing his physical theories. Nevertheless, he made many important mathematical discoveries and inventions, most notably the Laplace Transform. He was the premier expert at differential and difference equations, and definite integrals. He developed spherical harmonics, potential theory, the theory of determinants, and advanced Euler's technique of generating functions. In the fields of probability and statistics he made important advances: he proved the Law of Least Squares, and introduced the controversial ("Bayesian") rule of succession. In the theory of equations, he was first to prove that any polynomial of even degree must have a real quadratic factor.
Others might place Laplace higher on the List, but he proved no fundamental theorems of mathematics (though his partial differential equation for fluid dynamics is one of the most famous in physics), founded no major branch of pure mathematics, and wasn't particularly concerned with rigorous proof. (He is famous for skipping difficult proof steps with the phrase "It is easy to see".) Nevertheless he was surely one of the greatest mathematicians ever.pureapplied

(1777-1855) Germany Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss
Carl Friedrich Gauss, the "Prince of Mathematics," exhibited his calculative powers when he corrected his father's arithmetic before the age of three. His revolutionary nature was demonstrated at age twelve, when he began questioning the axioms of Euclid. His genius was confirmed at the age of nineteen when he proved that the regular n-gon was constructible, for odd n, if and only if n is the product of distinct prime Fermat numbers. At age 24 he published , probably the greatest book of pure mathematics ever.Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
Gauss built the theory of complex numbers into its modern form, including the notion of "monogenic" functions which are now ubiquitous in mathematical physics. The other contributions of Gauss are quite numerous and include the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (that an n-th degree polynomial has n complex roots), hypergeometric series, foundations of statistics, and differential geometry. Gauss was the premier number theoretician of all time, proving Euler's Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. He also did important work in geometry, providing an improved solution to Apollonius' famous problem of tangent circles; stating and proving the , and solving astronomical problems related to comet orbits and navigation by the stars. Gauss also did important work in several areas of physics.Fundamental Theorem of Normal Axonometry
Much of Gauss's work wasn't published: unbeknownst to his colleagues it was Gauss who first discovered doubly periodic elliptic functions, non-Euclidean geometry, a prime distribution formula, quaternions, foundations of topology, the Law of Least Squares, Dirichlet's class number formula, the butterfly procedure for rapid calculation of Fourier series, and even the rudiments of knot theory. Also in this category is the Fundamental Theorem of Functions of a Complex Variable (that the line-integral over a closed curve of a monogenic function is zero): he proved this first but let Cauchy take the credit.
Gauss wrote "It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, ... which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again ..."

(1788-1867) France Jean-Victor Poncelet
After studying under Monge, Poncelet became an officer in Napolean's army, then a prisoner of the Russians. To keep up his spirits as a prisoner he devised and solved mathematical problems using charcoal and the walls of his prison cell instead of pencil and paper. During this time he reinvented projective geometry. Poncelet became one of the most influential geometers ever; he is especially noted for his Principle of Continuity, an intuition with broad application. Although projective geometry had been studied earlier by mathematicians like Desargues, Poncelet's work excelled and served as an inspiration for other branches of mathematics including algebra, topology, Cayley's invariant theory and group-theoretic developments by Lie and Klein. His theorems of geometry include his Closure Theorem about Poncelet Traverses and the Poncelet-Brianchon Hyperbola Theorem. Perhaps his most famous theorem, although it was left to Steiner to complete a proof, is the beautiful Poncelet-Steiner Theorem about straight-edge constructions.

(1789-1857) France Augustin-Louis Cauchy
Cauchy was extraordinarily prodigious, prolific and inventive. Home-schooled, he awed famous mathematicians at an early age. In contrast to Gauss and Newton, he was almost over-eager to publish; in his day his fame surpassed that of Gauss and has continued to grow. Cauchy did important work in analysis, algebra and number theory. One of his important contributions was the "theory of substitutions" (permutation group theory).
Cauchy's research also included convergence of infinite series, differential equations, determinants, and probability. He invented the calculus of residues. Although he was one of the first great mathematicians to focus on abstract mathematics (another was Euler), he also made important contributions to mathematical physics, e.g. the theory of elasticity. He was the first to prove Fermat's conjecture that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of k k-gon numbers for any k, and also refined Euler's results in discrete topology. Another of Cauchy's contributions was his insistence on rigorous proofs.
One of the duties of a great mathematician is to nurture his successors, but Cauchy selfishly dropped the ball on both of the two greatest young mathematicians of his day, mislaying the key manuscripts of Abel and Galois. For this historical I've demoted Cauchy slightly.bothmiscontribution

(1796-1863) Switzerland JakobSteiner
Jakob Steiner made many major advances in synthetic geometry, hoping that classical methods could avoid any need for analysis; and indeed he was able to equal or surpass methods of the calculus of variations using just pure geometry. Although the underlying projective geometry was already known, he gave it a radically new and more productive basis, and created a new theory of conics. His work combined generality, creativity and rigor.Principle of Duality
Steiner developed several famous construction methods, e.g. for a triangle's smallest circumscribing and largest inscribing ellipses. Among many famous and important theorems of classic and projective geometry, he proved that the Wallace lines of a triangle lie in a 3-pointed hypocycloid, developed a formula for the partitioning of space by planes, and a fact about the surface areas of tetrahedra. Perhaps his three most famous theorems are the Isoperimetric Theorem (among solids of equal volume the sphere will have minimum area, etc.); the Poncelet-Steiner Theorem (lengths constructible with straightedge and compass can be constructed with straightedge alone as long as the picture plane contains the center and circumference of some circle); and his theorem about self-homologous elements in projective geometry. Along with Apollonius of Perga (who lived 2000 years earlier) Steiner is considered one of the two greatest geometers ever.
Steiner once wrote: "For all their wealth of content, ... music, mathematics, and chess are resplendently useless (applied mathematics is a higher plumbing, a kind of music for the police band). They are metaphysically trivial, irresponsible. They refuse to relate outward, to take reality for arbiter. This is the source of their witchery."

(1802-1829) Norway Niels HenrikAbel
At an early age, Niels Abel studied the works of the greatest mathematicians, found flaws in their proofs, and resolved to reprove some of these theorems rigorously. He was the first to fully prove the general case of Newton's Binomial Theorem, one of the most widely applied theorems in mathematics. Perhaps his most famous achievement was the (deceptively simple) Abel's Theorem of Convergence (published posthumously), one of the most important theorems in analysis; but there are several other Theorems which bear his name. Abel also made contributions in algebraic geometry and the theory of equations.
(replacing with ) is a key idea in mathematics (consider Newton's Fundamental Theorem of Calculus); Abel developed this insight. One of the most respected mathematicians of Abel's day had spent a lifetime studying elliptic integrals, but Abel inverted these to get elliptic functions, which quickly became a productive field of mathematics, and led to more general complex-variable functions, which were important to the development of both abstract and applied mathematics.Inversiony = f(x)x = f(y)-1
Finding the roots of polynomials is a key mathematical problem: the general solution of the quadratic equation was known by ancients; the discovery of general methods for solving polynomials of degree three and four is usually treated as the major math achievement of the 16th century; so for over two centuries an algebraic solution for the general 5th-degree polynomial (quintic) was a Holy Grail sought by most of the greatest mathematicians. Abel proved that most quintics did have such solutions. This discovery, at the age of only nineteen, would have quickly awed the world, but Abel was impoverished, had few contacts, and spoke no German. When Gauss received Abel's manuscript he discarded it unread, assuming the unfamiliar author was just another crackpot trying to square the circle or some such. His genius was too great for him to be ignored long, but, still impoverished, Abel died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-six. His fame lives on and even the lower-case word 'abelian' is applied to several concepts. Hermite said "Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for 500 years."not

Jacobi was a prolific mathematician who did decisive work in the algebra and analysis of complex variables, and did work in number theory (e.g. cubic reciprocity) which excited Carl Gauss. He is sometimes described as the successor to Gauss. As an algorist (manipulator of involved algebraic expressions), he may have been surpassed only by Euler and Ramanujan. Jacobi was also an especially inspirational math teacher.
Jacobi's most important early achievement was the theory of elliptic functions. He also made important advances in man
