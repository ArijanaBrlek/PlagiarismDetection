TORNADO INFORMATION
/span>Tornadoes can occur any place in the United States at any time of the year.  They happen most frequently in the midwestern, southern and central states from March through September.         
/span>        Tornado eathercan be hot, sticky days with southerly winds and a threatening ominous sky.  Familiar thunderstorm clouds are present.  An hour or two before a tornado, topsy-turvy clouds appear sometimes bulging down instead of up.  The clouds often have a greenish-black color.  Rain or hail frequently precedes the tornado.
/span>        Tornadoes occur mostly between 3 and 7 p.m., but they have occurred at all hours.
/span>        Tornadoes in most cases move from a westerly direction, usually from the southwest.  The tornado path is usually 10-40 miles (the average length is 16 miles), but they may move forward for 300 miles.  The average width of the path is about 400 yards, but they have cut swaths over a mile in width.  Speeds within the tornado have been estimated at 500 mph.
/span>        Tornadoes cause destruction with violent winds which uproot trees, destroy buildings, and which create a serious hazard from objects blown through the air.

SAFETY RULES: WHEN A TORNADO IS SIGHTED
If Outdoors:
/span>        Seek indoor shelter if time permits; if not, get into a ditch, ravine, or low-lying area.
/span>        If in a vehicle, park the vehicle and get into a ditch or ravine.  A vehicle offers no protection from a tornado.
In a House:
/span>        In houses, the basement offers the best protection.
/span>        In houses without basements, go to the center hallway, bathroom, or closet on the lower floor.
/span>        Stay away from windows get under heavy furniture.
In Apartments:
/span>        Move to the center hallway, bathroom, or closet.
/span>        Stay away from windows get under heavy furniture if possible.
In Mobile Homes:
/span>        Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to overturning during strong winds and offer no shelter.  Leave mobile home.  Seek mobile home trailer park shelter if available.  Otherwise, look for a ditch, culvert, or low-lying area.
In Schools:
/span>        Move to central hallways.  Avoid gymnasiums and auditoriums with large, poorly supported roofs.  Stay away from windows.  Follow the instructions of the principal.
In High-Rise Buildings:
/span>        Move to the center of the building, the hallway or stairways.  Avoid areas with large amounts of glass.
In Industrial Plants or Warehouses:
/span>        Move to an area that has interior walls.  Avoid windows.  Avoid areas with clear-span, lightly supported roofs.  Follow company policy.
In Shopping Centers:
/span>        Stay indoors.  Stay away from glass.  Move to an interior area close to interior walls.  Sit on floors to avoid flying debris.
General
/span>        Keep calm.  It will not help to get excited.  People have been killed by running out into streets. Even though a warning is issued, chances of a tornado striking one home or location are very slight.  Tornadoes cover such a small zone, as a rule, that relatively few places in a warned area are directly affected.
/span>         Keep tuned to your radio or television station for latest tornado advisory information.
