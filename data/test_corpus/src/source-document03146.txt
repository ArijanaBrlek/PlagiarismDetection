Welcome to Borderland
In 1906, Oakes Ames, a Harvard botanist, and his wife Blanche, an artist, purchased land on the border of Sharon and Easton. The country estate they named “Borderland” remained in the family for sixty-five years. In 1971, two years after the death of Blanche Ames, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the estate and opened it as a state park.
Borderland continues to offer the public many of the same pleasures that the Ameses enjoyed: walking and horseback riding on woodland trails, fishing and canoeing in the ponds, or, in winter, ice-skating and sledding. The family’s home, a three-story stone mansion built in 1910, still stands. Its twenty rooms are furnished much as they were when the Ameses lived here; many of Blanche Ames’ paintings grace the walls. During the spring, summer, and fall, the house is open to visitors for regularly scheduled guided tours.
The 1,570-acre park is operated by the Department of Environmental Management’s Division of Forests and Parks. An appointed Advisory Council participates in policy decision-making. The Friends of Borderland, a non-profit membership organization, assists the state in the preservation and interpretation of the park.
