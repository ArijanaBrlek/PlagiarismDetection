Articles of Faith
We believe that life is a sacred gift from God. Each person is created in the Divine image with a right of conscience and from conception until death is called to eternal union with God.
We believe that we share a responsibility according to our resources to promote health, to enhance the quality of life, and to secure justice in our pluralistic society.
We believe that the promotion of health implies a holistic response to the needs of all those whose lives we touch.
We believe that each person who shares in the management and delivery of health care has the responsibility to foster a supportive climate of cooperation and service in which the dignity of the person is respected and communicated.
We believe that the needs of the whole person, physical, spiritual and psycho-social are to be evaluated and responded to according to professional and institutional standards of excellence.
We believe that to develop the human potential is fundamental to insuring health and is consistent with Christian values. It is an obligation in justice to have and to develop competent and caring medical staff and personnel.
We believe that as members of the Church, we are committed to the values and principles expressed and/or implied in the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Facilities as approved by National Conference of Catholic Bishops (11-19-71.)
We believe that cooperation among the Alexian Brothers, civic and Church authorities, and those in partnership with our mission is essential.
We believe that it is necessary for all who collaborate with us in Catholic Health Care to be professionally competent and to have an understanding of our philosophy and mission. Therefore, education to this end is essential.
