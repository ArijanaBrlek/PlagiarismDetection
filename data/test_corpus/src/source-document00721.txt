Getting to / from
The best airport is an airport at which passengers don't notice where the ordinary world ends and the airport experience begins; i.e., an airport at which air road and rail have been integrated so well that it provides a seamless travel experience for the passengers. Frankfurt Airport comes closer to this ideal than any other major European airport. For example, nowhere are connecting routes as short as between the long-distance or regional train station to Terminal 1 and, via the Sky Line people mover, to Terminal 2 at Frankfurt. For you this means minimum waiting times, maximum convenience and fastorientation - in short, better, more convenient and more reliable traveling.
