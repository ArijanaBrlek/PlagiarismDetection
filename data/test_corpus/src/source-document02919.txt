What are Plateaus?
Have you ever heard or experienced this scenario before?
"I have successfully lost 15 of the 25 pounds that I want to lose, but now I am stuck at the same weight even though I am faithfully sticking to my diet. What has happened to me? Is the diet not working anymore?"
Yes, many women over 40 start off their weight loss programs full of excitement and determination, and indeed you do see the pounds dropping off over the first few weeks.
That's great, of course.
However, the next thing you know is that your progress has come to a dead stop...
... and you have just hit the dreaded weight loss "plateau".
But don't despair -- you are the only one experiencing this.not
Hitting a plateau is a common experience for most women over 40 on a weight loss program.
And it can be one of the most de-motivating things to happen.
Thankfully, overcoming it is easy... IF you know the simple steps you can take.
But first you need to know why plateaus happen.
You see, when you decide to go on a weight loss program you'll usually end up doing one or both of the following:
- consume fewer calories; and,
- increase the amount of exercise so that you burn more calories.
And if you do it correctly, you'll use up more energy (calories) than you are taking in, and you will lose some weight from the resulting calorie deficit.
But your body is an amazing machine -- over time it gets used to your new eating habits and exercise routine, and will adapt itself to this new calorie intake and expenditure.
In simple terms, your body adjusts itself to burn less calories, so that it will prevent itself from going into "famine" because it senses you are using more calories than you are taking in.
As a result, your body lowers your metabolism in an attempt to slow the use of your fatty energy reserves.
And then it happens.
That's when you find that the weighing scale needle stops moving, and your weight loss slows down or comes to a complete stop.
At this point, you will notice that your eating and exercise efforts are not producing your desired results i.e. little or no weight loss.
Well, the good news is that it's real easy to get over the plateaus which you'll inevitably hit.
In a nutshell, you have to do two things:
Alter your eating habits; and,
Change your exercise program in a way that challenges your body.
