’Democracy Now’ is cheap, true, non-corporate news
Spreading the word
s radio outlets fall into two general categories, both not-for-profit: community radio stations, and affiliates of the partially government-subsidised National Public Radio (NPR) network. Community radio stations feature local programming, are often staffed by volunteers and rely almost entirely upon their audience, including local businesses, for financial support.Democracy Now
Many community stations founded in the 1960s and 1970s were able to receive licences for full-power signals, while today there is a growing movement of low-power radio stations, helped by the Prometheus Radio Project.
NPR affiliates, on the other hand, largely broadcast the networks syndicated programmes, use full-power signals and have much more substantial budgets. NPR is financed by both corporations and the government, while their affiliate stations also rely on contributions from local audiences.
In addition to airing on a number of NPR outlets, can be seen on several stations in the similar Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television network. Although the programme receives broadcast fees from NPR and PBS stations, it receives no financing directly from corporations or the government.Democracy Now
Satellite television broadcasters in the US are currently required to turn over a few channels to not-for-profit groups doing public interest broadcasting, a provision that gives the Free Speech and Link satellite television networks, which carry Democracy Now, access to the airwaves.
