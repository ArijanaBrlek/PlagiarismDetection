Other McGregor Fence Components
About Our Electric Fence:
VEGETABLE GARDENERS: Don’t you get tired or seeing your garden attacked yearly by squirrels, woodchucks, raccoons, rabbits, or other varmints? You can end this problem permanently with an electric fence product, Mr. McGregor’s Fence®, that is child-safe, pet-safe, affordable, 100% effective, convenient, and trouble-free.
The system’s biggest advantage is its permanence. Other control measures (guns, traps, repellants, smoke bombs, etc.) are only deployed after the garden has taken damage, and more devastation may be done before the varmints are dispatched. In contrast, Mr. McGregor’s Fence® is always there. It happily withstands the winter, and after a few leaves are raked away it is ready for the Spring–long before the garden is planted, at a time when most of your friendly neighborhood veggie-munchers are still asleep.
Other advantages are convenience and safety. The easily installed system consists of a barrier fence behind two very low charged wires (the barrier fence is not electrified). An animal that encounters the barrier fence and tries to climb or burrow under it will come into good contact with the charged wires, get zapped, and go home. The wires are really low (4 inches and 8 inches off the ground), and so you the gardener are unlikely to get zapped unless you decide to weed around the fence without first unplugging the fence charger. If you happen to get zapped you won’t want to touch the wire again, but you definitely won’t be hurt–because the system’s special K-9 fence charger was designed to control small pets, and so it puts out a zap that is convincing but too weak to even harm a sparrow.
 
 
If You Already Have a Fence...
The system is generally sold as a kit, which comes with clear installation instructions (see Electric Fence Kits below). However, it is also possible to purchase all the necessary components separately. This is especially recommended if you already have a fence and so have no need of the barrier fence and 27-inch posts included in the kits.
People who already have a chain-link or wooden fence and want to mount electric fence wires near the top of it to keep out raccoons, squirrels, domestic pets, or other creatures should go to our website to purchase insulators suitable for attaching to the fence. www.electric-deer-fence.com
Whatever the specific components used, however, it is important to make sure the invading animal is grounded at the moment it touches the electrified wire or wires. This can be done on tall fences by running a strip of metal or 1.5-inch polytape (available on ) along the fence at a place where the animal's feet will be when it touches an active (electrified) wire with a nose or paw and by running a grounding wire from this metal or polytape over to the ground terminal on the electric fence charger, or if the K-9 charger is being used, over to a small ground rod (product 06-01) driven into the ground, because the K-9 has no ground terminal. electric-deer-fence.com
If the fence is tall enough to be out of reach of crawling infants and small pets, it may be desirable to use a more powerful electric fence charger than the Zareba K-9, something like the Fi-Shock SS-5 (0.5 joules) or the Fi-Shock SS-10 (1.5 joules) offered below. The sum total of supplies needed for such a project are 1) an AC-powered or battery-powered charger (products 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, or 01-07); 2) an insulated line long enough to get from your nearest AC outlet (where the charger will be) and the fence (product 02-28B, not needed if a battery-powered charger is used, because then the charger can be mounted right next to or on the fence); 3) aluminum electric fence wire (product 02-02); 4) insulators for holding the wire (available on www.electric-deer-fence.com); and 5) the grounding material (metal or tape) and the wire described above. No grounding material is needed if the fence is made of bare metal (chicken wire or chain link fencing), because then the fence itself is a conductor and is also grounded; but it is essential to keep the electrified wire out of contact with the fence at all times (in order for the climbing animal to get a shock), and it is also necessary (if the fence charger has a ground terminal) to run a wire (which need not be insulated) from the metal fence over to the ground terminal on the charger.
