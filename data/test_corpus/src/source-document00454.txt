The Mississippi Highway Patrol was created in 1938, with troopers first patrolling the highways on motorcycles. The original uniform worn by the first Mississippi troopers was a gray shirt with navy blue epaulettes trimmed with gold. The shirt had an MHP patch on each arm, which was very similar to the patch worn today, except it was blue and gold instead of blue and red. The pants were blue with a darker navy blue stripe down the leg bordered by gold piping. The uniform was changed in the 1960s. Red piping replaced gold for the shirt lapels as well as the pants leg for all Troopers holding the rank of Captain and below. This led to the nickname Red Leg given to Mississippi Troopers, signifying that they are not upper echelon administrative employees, but rather Road Men," troopers who worked enforcement on the highways. The automobile eventually replaced their motorcycles.
During the 1966 Meredith Mississippi March for Freedom which registered over 3000 African Americans to vote in Mississippi, the Mississippi Highway Patrol escorted thousands of civil rights activists from Memphis TN to Jackson MS. Leaders of major civil rights organizations, of the (Southern Christian Leadership Conference), of (Congress of Racial Equality) and of (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee) attended the protest. Guarded by the Mississippi Highway Patrol, the marchers were not attacked on their main route. The March concluded on June 26 with a rally of 15,000 people in Jackson, while over a thousand officers in the Mississippi Highway Patrol, National Guard, and local law enforcement agencies guarded the .

In 2003 the Mississippi Highway Patrol appointed L.M. Claiborne to become the first African American Colonel of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Colonel Claiborne began his career with the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol in December 1980, as a Trooper assigned to Troop H, Louisville, Mississippi. He was promoted to the rank of Trooper First Class in December 1985 and in December 1987 to the rank of Staff Sergeant assigned as the Accident Reconstructionist in Troops H and G. In March 1989, Colonel Claiborne was among the first Highway Patrol Officers to attend training for and become a Crime Scene Investigator with the rank of Sergeant First Class. Claiborne was then promoted to Captain over the training division where he served until his promotion to Colonel.

Entry into the ranks of the Mississippi Highway Patrol requires the completion of a 18 to 20 week training program held at the MS Law Enforcement Officers Training Academy. Typically over 500 applicants apply to each class, though only 100 cadets will begin the training. Less than 50 will graduate as Troopers. Academy curriculum includes academics, law, EVOC, first aid, physical training, boxing, ground fighting and advanced officer survival. The training places extreme pressure on each cadet to test his or her will to Never Quit . A sign in the classroom reads, MORE SWEAT IN TRAINING LESS BLOOD ON THE STREETS. Cadets attend the academy at , and live on the academy grounds sequestered from outside contact. Weekend leave may be granted upon completion of all academic and physical requirements. Weekend leave may also be canceled at any time at the request of the academy staff. Upon graduation, new Troopers are assigned to various counties throughout the state according to the needs of the Highway Patrol. Mississippi employs an average of 550 Troopers statewide.
