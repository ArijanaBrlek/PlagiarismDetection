CD-Type Annuities
The interest rate offered at the time of the annuity purchase determines how much the investor earns on his/her investment. Basically, higher the rate means more interest and that results in more income which the investor will receive. Annuity rates are higher for older annuitants and lower for younger annuitants, based on life expectancy. Annuity rates are also adjusted according to the number of annuitants, with rates for two-life contracts often lower due to the extended life expectancy.Annuity Rates
A specific annuity rate is a matter of agreement between the donor and the insurance company. The age of an annuitant is the age reached at the nearest birthday when the contract is made, and rates are the same for men and women. Deferred annuity is a type of long-term retirement account under which individual can grow his/her assets and this annuity provides a stream of income once the annuitant retires.

what is CD-type annuity? CD-type deferred annuity is a annuity which provides the annuitant various income benefits. The main benefit from CD-type deferred annuity is fixed-rate of interest which matches the surrender penalty period.

Immediate annuity provides rates according to which a regular monthly payment to the annuitant is made after the investment or deposit money to the insurance company has been made. The rates or rate of interest provided in an immediate annuity plan differ from deferred annuity rates. The main reason behind this is that the immediate annuity rates are influenced by various factors like the choice of payments; the age of the annuitant etc. on the other hand no such factors have any influence on deferred annuity.
