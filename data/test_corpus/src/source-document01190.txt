Medium Wild Cats
Three quarters of the world's wild cat species are small or medium sized. In spite of this, little is known of their behaviour, ecology or status. To increase public knowledge, we have compiled fact sheets on all wild cats. Reproduction of these fact sheets is encouraged. The intention of writing them was to help spread the word on the small cats, and we urge you to continue the process.
This page features links to the some of the medium sized wild cats in the world, those weighing from 8-25 kg (18-55 lbs). 
 We have also translated the Neotropical (Central & South American) cat fact sheets into Spanish.
