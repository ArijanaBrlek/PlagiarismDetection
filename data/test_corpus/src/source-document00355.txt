The film begins during . Chaplin, as an unnamed private in the army of the fictional nation of Tomainia (allusion to poisoning), valiantly attempts to rescue an officer named Schultz (), only to lose his memory when the plane the two had taken off in crashes into a tree. Schultz escapes from the wreckage, and the young private spends the next 20 years in the hospital, thoroughly oblivious to the changes that are taking place in Tomainia: Adenoid Hynkel (cf. , Chaplin in a double role), now the ruthless of Tomainia, has undertaken to persecute Jews throughout the land, aided by ministers Garbitsch (cf. ) (played by ) and Herring (cf. ) (played by ).

Meanwhile, Schultz, who has come up in the ranks in the intervening 20 years, recognizes the barber (who is reminded of WWI by Schultz and therefore gets his memory back) and, though surprised to find him a Jew, orders the storm troopers to leave him and Hannah alone. Hynkel, in addition, has relaxed his stance on Tomainian Jewry in an attempt to woo a Jewish financier into giving him a . Egged on by Garbitsch, Hynkel has become obsessed with the idea of . (In one famous scene, he dances with a large, inflatable to the tune of a theme from 's ). On Garbitsch's advice, Hynkel has planned to invade the neighboring country of Osterlich (likely a corruption of , the name for ) and needs the loan to finance the invasion. Eventually, the financier refuses, and Hynkel reinstates his persecution of the Jews, this time to an even greater extent. loan world domination globe Richard Wagner Lohengrin sterreich German Austria
Schultz voices his objection to the , and Hynkel orders him placed in a . Schultz flees to the ghetto and begins planning to overthrow the Hynkel regime. To decide who will carry out this plot, a coin is placed in one of five puddings, and the person who receives the one with the coin in it is to carry out the mission to blow up the palace, considered a . However, Hannah has placed a coin in every dessert, leading to one of Chaplin's most comical scenes. Eventually, both Schultz and his barber friend are captured and condemned to the concentration camp. pogrom concentration camp suicide mission
Hynkel is initially opposed by Benzino Napaloni (a of and ) (played by ), dictator of Bacteria, in his plans to invade Osterlich. Hynkel invited Napaloni to talk the situation over in Tomainia, however, and attempted to impress Napaloni with a display of military might and psychological warfare, and thus invites Napolini to a military show. The military show turned out to be a disaster. Hynkel's "light artillery" did not arrive. Hynkel's bombers fall from the sky after initially being mistaken for Napaloni's planes. The tanks do arrive, but they totally fail to impress Napaloni, who claims to have tanks that can fly and go under the water. (Herring blusters that they are concentrating on "flying ".) After some friction (and a comedic food fight) between the two leaders, a deal is made (which Hynkel immediately breaks) and the invasion proceeds successfully. Hannah, who has since emigrated to Osterlich to escape Hynkel, once again finds herself living under Hynkel's regime. portmanteau Benito Mussolini Napoleon Bonaparte Jack Oakie dreadnoughts

The barber, who has assumed Hynkel's identity, is taken to the Tomainian capital to make a victory speech.

Hannah hears the barber's speech on the radio, and is amazed when "Hynkel" addresses her directly: "Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up, Hannah. The clouds are lifting. The sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and brutality. Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow -- into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up". [4]
[] edit Cast and analysis
The film stars Chaplin as Hynkel and the barber, as Hannah, as Napaloni, as Schultz, as Garbitsch and as Field Marshal Herring, an incompetent adviser to Hynkel.

Much of the film is taken up by Hynkel and Napaloni arguing over the fate of Osterlich (). Originally, Mussolini was opposed to the German takeover since he saw Austria as a buffer-state between Germany and Italy. The international community (in particular, and , Mussolini's partners) did not share Italy's concern over German and even supported sanctions against Italy. In 1936, Mussolini submitted to Hitler's will, withdrew Italian troops from the along the Austrian border, and moved closer to Germany, as Hitler did not apply sanctions against Italy.

The film contains several of Chaplin's most famous sequences. The rally speech by Hynkel, delivered in -sounding gibberish, is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin studied carefully in newsreels. The German words , and can be made out, as well as "" and phrases such as "cheese'n'crackers" and frequently "lager beer", in the fake German Hynkel speaks during the rally and at other points in the film when he is angry (though he normally speaks English). Billy Gilbert as Herring is also required to improvise this fake German at times, and at one point (where he is apologizing for having accidentally knocked Hynkel down the stairs) he comes up with the word "". Chaplin is clearly taken by surprise and repeats, "Der banana?" before incorporating the word into his own reply. Chaplin, as Hynkel, has a tendency to remove Herring's medals when he is angry. In the scene where Hynkel receives news that Napaloni mobilized his troops along the Osterlich border, Hynkel not only removed all of Herring's medals, but removed all of his buttons on his shirt, revealing a striped shirt with suspenders and then slaps Herring.

Chaplin, as the barber, shaves a customer in tune with a radio broadcast of 's , recorded in one continuous take. The film's most celebrated sequence is the dance between Hynkel and a balloon globe in his palatial office, set to 's , which is also used at the end of the film when the Jewish barber is making the victory speech in Hynkel's place. The globe dance had its origins in the late 1920s, when Chaplin was filmed at a party doing an early version of the dance, with a globe and a military helmet (this footage appears in the documentary ).

The film ends with the barber, having been mistaken for the dictator, delivering an address in front of a large audience and over the radio to the nation, following the Tomainian take-over of Osterlich (an obvious reference to the German of on March 12, 1938).

[] edit Making of the film
The film was written and directed by Chaplin, and was shot largely at the Chaplin Studios and other locations around Los Angeles (such as , where the elaborate World War I scenes were filmed). Chaplin was motivated by the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. However, Chaplin later stated that he would not have made the film if he had known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes. Laurel Canyon

As Hitler and his Nazi Party rose to prominence, Chaplin's popularity throughout the world became greater than ever; he was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to , which annoyed the Nazis, who published a book in 1934 titled , in which the comedian was described as "a disgusting Jewish acrobat." , a close friend of Chaplin, relates that he sent Chaplin a copy of the book and always believed this was the genesis of "Dictator."

The making of the film coincided with rising tensions throughout the world. Speculation grew that this and other anti-fascist films such as and would remain unreleased given the United States' neutral relationship with Germany. The project continued largely because Chaplin was financially and artistically independent of other studios; also, failure to release the film would have Chaplin, who had invested $1.5 million of his own money in the project. The film eventually opened in in September 1940, to a wider American audience in October and the United Kingdom in December. The film was released in France in April 1945, shortly after the .

[] edit Reception
The film was well received at the time of its release, and was popular with the American public. The film was also popular in the United Kingdom, drawing 9 million to the theatres. Jewish audiences were deeply moved by the portrayal of Jewish characters and their plight, which was still a taboo subject in Hollywood films of the time. Critical opinion was mixed, with many reviewers critical of Chaplin's final speech, and some felt the portrayal of storm troopers was inappropriate. This opinion magnified as the horrors of the Nazis were uncovered, and Chaplin admitted in his autobiography that he could not have made the film if he had been aware of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.
