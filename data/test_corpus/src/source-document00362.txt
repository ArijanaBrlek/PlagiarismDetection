Repetitive Strain Injuries Are Unique For Each Person!
Your RSI is different than the person next to you, even though you both may have the same diagnosis. This means that the and its unique pattern of injury in order for the solution to be an effective one for you.solution must be based on your body
This is a challenge that has not been addressed by the available RSI therapies until now. Through my years of practice and inquiry into the dynamics of RSI's, I have discovered ways to create specialized programs that address your injury's unique characteristics.
Most people think that if they do the right series of stretches and other exercises that their injury will be healed. Well, that is only partly true. The correct stretches will help immensely, but knowing how to manipulate those stretches to help you reach all the little hidden pockets of damaged tissue in your body will be the factor that will change your recovery from just "okay" to a spectacular one.
There is a Self Care Program To Meet Your Needs
I have taken each type of repetitive strain injury and dissected it to discover the most important areas that must be released of their adhesions, restrictions, and holding patterns to get the best results. Then, based on my years of experience in the field of soft tissue injuries, I have expanded that information to include all of the other, more hidden, areas of the body which are perpetuating your symptoms and making recovery an illusive dream. These hidden areas of injury also need to be released in order to have the best possible outcome.
To help you access and release these hidden areas of your body, I have developed a series of simple techniques which change and adapt the stretches you are doing to get the most customized results possible for your body.
