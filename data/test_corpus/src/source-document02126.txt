Students must have their transcripts from their postsecondary education evaluated to determine the U.S. equivalency. Various international educational firms can interpret the educational backgrounds of people who have studied outside the United States and need statements of U.S. equivalencies (see the list below under Accepted Credential Evaluation Service Organizations ). These evaluators issue two main types of reports:Non-US Transcripts
Verifies the type of degree earned and whether or not the Non-U.S. institution is equivalent to an accredited U.S. institution.Degree-only verification
Verifies whether or not the non-U.S. institution is equivalent to an accredited U.S. institution and includes a separate report that provides U.S. semester credit, grade equivalent, and level equivalent (graduate or undergraduate) for each course. The report is used for Transfer Credit Evaluations (TCE).Course by course evaluation
Undergraduate transfer students (those who have college-level credits they wish to transfer) are required to submit an Request for Transfer Credit Evaluation application as part of their admission process.  They must request the educational agency interpreting their non-U.S. college-level transcript to send a course-by-course evaluation report directly to AMU.Undergraduate Students:
