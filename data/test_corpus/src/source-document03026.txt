I like international delight hazelnut and french vanilla coffee creamer. Need some suggestions!!!   Hi:) Could someone be so kind and look through my writing? It is a part of my coursework. Thank you! "Running Costs: " Sales To find out my sales figures I decided to find out what is the average spending of each customer, than I multiply this figure by the average number of customer which I expect to have each day. The average spending of each customer would be 3.5 (piece of cake a cup of coffee) and I am expecting to get about 8 customers per hour. To make my calculations more accurate I decided to visit on of the competitive business which is located in different part of town centre. The main reason of it was find out how many customers they could get within one hour. This research confirmed my predictions, however I am excepting to sales will increase during summer months and Christmas time " Rent My premises is located in market place. By locating my business in such a populated place there is going to be much better opportunity to get more customers because there is a wide range of shops which attract many people. Rent costs me 16,992 per annum. " Wages and employing staff I want to operate my business by myself, however, I will need to employ two members of staff. I will need one full time worker to help me operate the business in general and a second employee to work during the lunch time hours to help with preparing snacks and lunch dishes. I will offer them temporary, 12 month contracts, the first contract on a 40 hour per week plus overtime basis and a second contract on a 20 hour per week plus overtime basis. " Gas and electricity My figures show an average expense for a small catering businesses. " Telephone and Internet I need access to Internet and phone to contact with my supplies and make orders. I decided to get telephone and internet form Talk Talk. It costs me just 16.99 and this price includes unlimited phone calls to UK landlines in the evenings & weekends, 36 international destinations, TalkTalk customers anytime and free broadband. " Advertising The advertising of the business in first two months (January and February), would cost 110. This included printed leaflets and advert in local newspaper. In next months it would decrease to 6 and this amount include advert in local newspaper. " Office expenses My office expenses includes small expenses like toner carriages, printer paper, postage etc. " Lease of equipment Lease of assets It allows my business to use an asset without having to buy it. I do not have to put up large sums of capital to be able to use asses and I can exchange the asserts for a more modern. It is good option for me because my capital is limited." Thank you :)   I met a girl on an internet dating agency last March 08 and dated her, I thought it was just a bit of fun and dated her for a while, she grew on me and I started to feel very strongly for her and was so attracted to her. We became an item and decided to take the children to Eurodisney in May. It was a disaster and we split soon after we came back, her child is 12 and female mine is 6 and male, the children didn't really gel at all. Anyhow, we briefly got back together in June and then split a few days later, she said when she gets strong feelings for anyone she walks. Her ex is an ex england football international and plays in the premier league. She has a daughter to him. I'd always felt that this girl was not right in the head to put it bluntly, she never seemed to have got over the glam lifestyle her ex gave her and this had a huge impact on her life when they split, from riches back to rags. She was so nasty when we split and went off with another man within 2 weeks of us splitting and that hurt me so much. I just didn't understand how she could treat us so bad when all we did was treat her and her daughter with kindness and respect. Anyhow, to cut a long story short, this girl 7 months later since we split is in contact with me everyday via txt or e-mail. I've told her many times I'd prefer that she didn't contact me so I can get on and hopefully meet someone else, but the txts and e-mails continue. I've seen her once since we split, we went for coffee and chatted. I have to admit I've given her the opportunity numerous times to go for a drink or meal or night out with me and she just says no, yet she continues to txt me everyday, she never phones to speak, not once in 7 months! It's always txt or e-mail. She sent my son a christmas present which was nice but why send one? I haven't as much as sent her a christmas card nor do I ever txt her, it's always her txting me, I try to ignore it but then she pulls my heartstrings, then I say ok lets meet to chat and as soon as do that it either all goes quiet or she just says no. I just don't get her! I really don't, maybe this is a question that should be answered by girls? Re: my feelings for this girl, 7 months later all this txting one meeting and yeah I have to admit I still have very strong feelings for her. Why I do I must be mad! and I wish I had the answer why I feel the way I do about this girl. My question is why is she doing this i.e. all the txting and when I ask to see her she declines. Also why when she has treated and hurt me so badly do I have such strong feelings for her even now and what should I do about it as it's making me feel so miserable.

Original information same as on website: Starbucks Corporation is a worldwide coffeehouse chain based in Seattle, Washington. Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with 15,012 stores in 44 countries. Starbucks sells drip brewed coffee; espresso based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and Hear Music brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the companys products are seasonal or particular to the devotion of the store. Starbucks brand ice cream and coffees are also sold at grocery stores. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a speed that was persistent into late of the year 2000. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S in 2009. The first location outside the United States and Canada was established in the 1990s, and they now make up one third of Starbucks stores. By late March 2008, Starbucks had more than 16,226 stores worldwide, including 11,434 stores located in the United States. On July, 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under performing company owned stores and cutting U.S expansion plans among growing economic uncertainty. On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non retail jobs as part of its bid to re energize the brand and enhance its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of abundant growth and expansion that began in the mid 1990s. The original Starbucks was opened in Pike, Place Market in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by three partners: English teacher Jerry Baldwin, history teacher Zev Siegel, and writer Gordon Bowker. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971-1976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place as of today it is still open. Entrepreneur Howard Schultz joined the company in 1983, and after a trip to Milan, Italy, advised that the company sell coffee and espresso drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its most important focus. To them, coffee was something to be prepared in the home. In 1987, Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at Waterfront Station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Chicago, Illinois, that same year. At the same time of its initial public offering on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets. The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in Tokyo in 1996. Starbucks entered the U.K. market in 1998 with the achievement of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005, London had more outlets than Manhattan, a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand. In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. These restaurants were soon turned into Starbucks establishments. In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia from AFC Enterprises, bringing the total number of Starbucks operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, competitor Diedrich Coffee announced that it would sell most of its company owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company owned locations of the Oregon based Coffee People chain. Starbucks has changed the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. Starbucks' chairman, Howard Schultz, has talked about making sure growth does not weaken the company's traditions and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company. In January 2008, Chairman Howard Schultz resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's main challenge is to restore what he calls the "distinctive Starbucks experience" in the face of rapid expansion. analyst believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. Dunkin' Donuts is an international donut and coffee retailer founded in 1950 in Quincy, Massachusetts by William Rosenberg. In 1946, William Rosenberg founded Industrial Luncheon Services as a company to deliver meals and coffee break snacks to customers in Ok since it didnt all show up go to my other question similar to this its shorter.   Well... i got to this international school and the thing is, that if you are dating you only really see eachother at school because I don't live in a place where you can walk to the mall or a coffee shop or anything after school. It takes atleast 10 - 15 minutes. So say I was dating a guy, where would we go on dates without having to be driven around by our older siblings or parents? :)   Starbucks Quality plus Social Conscious Sells Around the World Starbucks was started in 1971 by three academicians in Seattle. Ten years later, Howard Schultz joined the company. During his trip to Italy, he realized that the coffee house could be much more than that of a simple place where you drink coffee. However his idea was not accepted by the owner of the company being frustrated, Howard Schultz looked for investors and eventually bought the company. From 1987 until 1992, Starbucks remained a privately-held company. When the company ventured outside the Pacific Northwest, the company first experience disappointment which were followed by mix to moderate successes. Howards dream was to not only provide a friendly environment for the customers, but also for its employees provide friendly service. This meant taking good care of its employees by providing healthcare benefits not only for its full-time employees, but also for those working 20 hours or more. Moreover, employees could also purchase stocks in the company. In a nut-shell, company pay and benefits attracted motivated employees with good skills. Starbucks aim was to build a company with soul . This meant that employees had to listen carefully to what customers want and meet their expectations. The customeroriented philosophy was expressed in the mission statement which also emphasized that employees treating one another with dignity, enjoying diversity in the workplace, reflecting the local community, having high standards for coffee, being a good member of the community, and being, of course, profitable. The mission statement resulted in strategies that led not only to domestic but also international expansion. In 2006, the Starbucks website displayed its presence in 16 international countries including Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The long-term goal was to have some 25000 stores in various locations. To achieve this long range aim, Starbucks designed stores with pleasant ambience which customers, surrounded by coffee aroma, have been really enjoying. Also, since 2002, the company worked with T-Mobile USA by providing internet access in the coffee shops. Besides offering caffeinated and decaffeinated beverages, a great variety of specialty coffees as well as teas are offered. Customers can also get juices, pastries, coffee mugs, coffee-making equipment and even CDs. Moreover, Starbucks partnered with PepsiCo and Dreyers Grand Ice Cream and engaged in licensing agreement with Kraft Foods. Coffee is also offered at warehouse club, Marriot Host international, United Airlines and even at Wells Fargo Bank. Catalog sales were tried but did not succeed and consequently were discontinued. Starbucks also invested unsuccessfully in a number of dot.com companies. The sense of social responsibilities guided the companys actions. Not only did the firm participate in local charities to give back to the community in which it operates, but also applied this sense of responsibility to its purchasing practices. Most of its retail stores and hotels with which the company had licensing agreements, used Fair Trade Certified coffee. Clearly, the company has been successful despite competition from coffee makers such as Proctor & Gamble, Nestle and Kraft General Foods. How, then, will Starbucks meet those and other challenges in the future? Questions 1. Why was Starbucks so successful? 2. How does Starbucks differ from other coffee houses? 3. How could the company attract non-coffee drinkers? 4. What other challenges may Starbucks encounter in the future?   Starbucks Quality plus social conscious sells around the world Starbucks was started in 1971 by three academicians in Seattle.

It basically states the following: Sharon Tate Polanski - Actress, wife of director Roman Polanski, 8 1/2 months pregnant at time of murders. Tate begged for the life of her child as Susan Atkins stabbed her. Atkins testified in court to telling Tate, "Look, *****, I have no mercy for you": Stabbed 16 times in the chest, back, and arms. 5 of these wounds alone were sufficient to cause death. Cause of death: Stabs wounds to the heart, lungs, and liver, causing massive hemorrhage. Jay Sebring - Professional hairstylist and owner of Sebring International, ex-fiance of Sharon Tate, friend of Tate and Polanski. It is believed Sebring and Frykowski struggled with their killers before being subdued: Stabbed 7 times, shot once. 3 of these stab wounds alone, as well as the gunshot wound, were sufficient to cause death. Cause of death: Exsanguination - Sebring literally bled to death. Abigail Folger - Friend of Tate and Polanski, girlfriend of Voytek Frykowski, heiress to Folger coffee fortune. Folger was chased through the house and onto the lawn, where, according to her murderer, Patricia Krenwinkel, she screamed, "I'm already dead! I'm already dead!" while being stabbed: Stabbed 28 times in the arms, chest, and back, along with severe lacerations to face. Cause of death: Stab wound to aorta - main artery to heart. Voytek Frykowski - Unemployed writer, boyfriend of Abigail Folger, childhood friend of Roman Polanski. Frykowski also managed to escape the home, but put up a vicious struggle on the lawn with his assailants: Shot 2 times, struck in face and head with pistol 13 times, stabbed 51 times over entire body. Cause of death: Multiple stab wounds to body causing massive hemorrhage. Steven Earl Parent - High school senior, visiting houseboy William Garretson, who lived in a guest house adjacent to the Tate/Polanski home. Parent was shot while leaving the property - he did not know Sharon Tate or any of her three houseguests, and was the first victim: Shot 4 times in the arm, chest, and head. One defensive, slashing wound to palm of hand. Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds. Leno LaBianca - Grocery-store owner, husband of Rosemary LaBianca. Leno and his wife Rosemary were bound with what was believed to be a leather thong by Charles Manson, who then left the scene, leaving Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Tex Watson to take over: Stabbed 12 times with a knife, stabbed 14 times with a two-tined fork. 6 of these wounds alone were sufficient to cause death. Cause of death: Multiple stab wounds to the neck and abdomen, causing massive hemorrhage. Rosemary LaBianca - Mother, wife of Leno LaBianca, and owner of an upscale botique in Los Angeles, Rosemary fought hard with her killers when she heard the sound of her husband being murdered in the next room. In the days before her murder, Rosemary told friends that 'someone' had been inside her home while she and Leno were away, and described household objects and furniture being moved. It was later learned that Manson and his accomplices had 'creepy-crawled' several houses in the area while the residents were away: Stabbed 41 times, some of the wounds post-mortem. 6 of theses wounds alone were sufficient to cause death. Cause of death: Multiple stab wounds to the neck and trunk, causing massive hemorrhage. Got two questions 1. For each victim it says that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds caussing massive hemorrhage, does this mean that the victims basically bled to death? 2. There bodies were found several hours after the murder, but if help was too have arrived, say right after the suspects were leaving the crime scene, could the lives of some of these victims have been saved with immediate medical attention?   We are a group of coffee farmers from Java Indonesia who want to sell produce from the plantation directly to consumers such as the international cafe shop, hotels and restaurants.   These days my country which used to be quite tolerant (the Netherlands) has started closing coffee shops and brothels and the like. This is done under major international pressure. So my government is outlawing things that i believe shouldn't be illegal. Why would you forbid someone to smoke a joint? As long as he doesn't drive a car the chance that he'll harm anyone is pretty much zero. Alcohol and cigarettes do much more damage to society and there still here. Nobody is questioning them though...(not that i want them questioned ;)) I think that you should be able to do whatever you want as long as you don't harm others and i think that should be the basis of law in general. So what if i smoke something or ride my bicycle or don't wear my seat belt....i won't harm anyone doing it!   I have aI have already established a coffee shop and look for a name for that. I hope that I can build an international brand for my coffee shop and also could establish more branches in the entire world. The coffee shop place in an cinema complex . hope that u could suggest good name for that. Tnx.   coffee-mate creamers or international delight coffee creamer   By MARIA GALLUCCI, Associated Press Writer Maria Gallucci, Associated Press Writer  Fri Nov 21, 6:15 pm ET MEXICO CITY  Hiroshi Nohara is on a layover at the Mexico City airport. It has lasted almost three months, and he has no plans to leave. For reasons he can't explain, the Japanese man has been in Terminal 1 of the Benito Juarez International Airport since Sept. 2, surviving off donations from fast-food restaurants and passengers and sleeping in a chair. At first, he frightened passengers, and airport authorities asked the Japanese Embassy to investigate why the foul-smelling man refused to leave. Now, he's somewhat of a celebrity, capturing Mexico's collective imagination with nearly daily television news reports on his life at the food court. Tourists stop to pose with him for photographs or get an autograph. The Tokyo native flew into Mexico with a tourist visa and a return ticket home, but he never left the airport. In an interview Thursday alongside the airport McDonald's, he said he had no motive for his extended stay and doesn't know how much longer he'll remain. "I don't understand why I'm here," he said through a visiting interpreter originally hired by a television station. "I don't have a reason." The embassy can't force him to leave, and since Nohara's visa is valid all Mexican officials can do it wait for it to expire in early March. During his stay, Nohara's wiry goatee has grown into a scraggly mass. His red-tinted hair is speckled with dust and dandruff, and his cream-colored jacket and fleece blanket are dingy with overuse. He smells like he hasn't had a shower in months. "He's a calm person, a nice man," said Silvia Navarrete del Toro, an airport janitor. "He just sits here and eats all day." Various stalls in the food court give Nohara free snacks and drinks, sometimes even throwing in hats or coffee mugs with store logos to get free publicity during his frequent television appearances. Strangers often buy him pastries or hamburgers; he prefers the latter. He sits with the interpreter, talking and laughing for hours, at a small table covered with cups of cold coffee, packets of ketchup and sandwiches wrapped in foil. Stroking his facial hair, Nohara said the 2004 film "The Terminal," starring Tom Hanks as an Eastern European man stuck in a New York City airport, was not his inspiration. But he acknowledged the similarities. "My life," he joked, "is 'The Terminal 2.'" http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20081121/ap_tr_ge/lt_travel_brief_mexico_living_at_airport I'm sure that Mr. Hiroshi Nohara is a pretty cool guy and all, but I doubt if this would fly (no pun intended) here in the United States. TSA would be all over this guy. ( ^ _ ^ ) Mr. Hiroshi Nohara is probably a wealthy man and is conducting an experiment. He's taking particular notice of how slack Airport Security is. Or maybe he's just truly enjoys living in an airport and living from "hand to mouth." My advice? Investigate this guy and make him go home! : ) Should have read "Maybe he truly enjoys." Typo. :) Actually his Visa is valid until early March of this year. So he can't be forced to leave. As long as he's not a spy or a terrorist. : )   1. They created an international incident between Japan and Australia by staging a hostage incident that they were 100% guilty of manufacturing. 2. The captain wouldn't even get up when that boat of 4 people was lost. He left some incompetent slacker guy in charge who didn't know how to manage anything. The Dutch guy Wilfred tried to organize a search party but got demoted! WTF?! These idiots actually asked the whaling ship THEY WERE CHASING for help finding the boat! 3. The people on that boat are not qualified to operate it. Most of them look like they were recruited out of coffee shops in Seattle or Ann Arbor. They are WEIRD. 4. Instead of making sure they picked up their friends after the Japanese and Australians spent 3 days negotiating their release, they delayed it in order to harass the Yushin Maru again. I actually support the whalers after watching some episodes. I wouldn't blame them for installing a gun cannon on board and sinking the Sea Shepherd...what else are they but pirates and terrorists?   Since nestle coffee-mate changed their labeling they also seemed to change the flavor as well. The guys at work are complaining it taste terrible and I agree,Yuck! I also buy it for home but my 'stock' of old is running low. Has anyone else noticed this new taste? What do you think of it? Has anyone found an alternative besides "International Creamer" that taste good?   I'm not making this up, you can check the full text here: http://pe.usps.gov/text/imm/il_008.htm But WHY? When I read the list of prohibited items I thought it was some kind of joke! What the hell is going on in Italy? They BAN playing cards and toys!

I love the ones from Starbucks, Joe Mugs, etc but when I make it, it tastes nothing like it! I've tried Stash, International something-or-other (it's an instant mix), Mystic spiced chai and others but I just don't like any of those. Am I make it wrong or are they just different? Help!   I hang around with a group of 4 girls, we became really good friends during this summer but it still feels like I'm no one's favourite friend... and it really brings me down not to be someone's best friend. I consider myself a good friend and fun to be with, so why won't they care to give me a call? I feel like I don't have the best status in the group. For example two of them connect differently because they're both from Polland and the other two well they're a bit weird, excentric and they seem to get a long quite well. So everyone's apparently paired up and I find myself yeah being their friend, I know they care about me, but I'm just not the person they keep in mind all the time or so it makes me feel. Like they don't call me as much and I feel I have to be in constant touch with them so I don't lose the opportunity to socials and stuff. And I'm always finding out that they got together at the library for a cup of coffee and things like that, and I feel I am hardly included. I feel like I have to push it to be remembered, and I hate that, I hate thinking like that! I know friendships should just happen, it has just been really hard for me all my life and I don't get why? I'm a catch! the worse thing is that I did have a great connection with this girl who happened to be my neighbour last year but she's left the country because she was an international student, so I find myself with a lot of buddies everywhere but never really a best friend. My best friend had usually been my bf but now we broke up and let's face it a girl needs her best friend to be a girl! i think i'm always a bit paranoid. i am included in their plans it's just that sometimes they plan stuff with either of the ones in the group, i mean you can't always do everything together and sometimes you want a one on one. i just feel bad because i think no one wants a one on one with me. another thing, i just got a text from my friend asking how i was and if i did well on a presentation at uni, see don't they care? i think i'm always a bit paranoid. i am included in their plans it's just that sometimes they plan stuff with either of the ones in the group, i mean you can't always do everything together and sometimes you want a one on one. i just feel bad because i think no one wants a one on one with me. another thing, i just got a text from my friend asking how i was and if i did well on a presentation at uni, see don't they care?   In CANADA ..

West 49 Windsor Ties WirelessWave Yogen Fruz Zellers Zennkai Salon Thanks! I'm a girl   I'm 25 years old girl applying for graduate program in columbia college. I don't really like to go to clubs or bars. I do like hanging out in coffee shops, eating great food but doesn't have to be in expensive and fancy restaurants. Love street shopping and finding great bargains in markets too. Walking distance to Target, Walgreen's / Walmart is preferable since I would be living with my aunt who likes to cook so it would be great that she can go shopping alone in nearby areas. I've never been to chicago before so I have no idea about neighborhoods there. Can somebody please give me some tips about where to live in the city? Thanks a lot!! Please inform me with safe neighborhood but with reasonable cost for apartments too.. Thanks!   Most colombianos eat pork, rice and beans, steak, and fried eggs in the mornning. Dinner is similar, except for the eggs. In the coastal region, the emphasis is on seafood. In Cartagena, the typical lunch is rice with coconut, fried plantains, and shrimp. Colombians enjoy a national and international cuisines. Commercial agriculture stresses bananas, cut flowers, sugar, and coffee., The economy is sensitive to fluctuations in the market price. Manufacturing exports include textiles, garments, chemicals, and metal products. Despite rich mineral deposits, Colombia takes less than 4 percent of the gross domestic product from mining.   Would you rather get your coffee from a nice little local corner coffee shop, or from a big international coffee chain like Starbucks? i prefer the local corner coffee. It seems like the employees much nicer and passionate about their job than they are at Starbucks...and the coffee is sooo much better local in my opinion :) What do you think?   Okay, I really don't wanna hear how I should do my own homework, you could have finished it by the time you finished typing this. 1, History is my worst subject so it takes me forever, and 2, I type fast.

Does anyone have any recipes or ideas? How long would it keep?   Is Coffee-Mate or International Delight the better coffee creamer? Which one has more sweeter flavor. Also, what flavor do you like(in either of those creamers)? Also, which type of creamer is better? Is the powder or liquid creamer better? All answers will be appreciated!! thanks!! anymore answers??   sorry for posting this in philosophy: it's because i have high-respect from the people in this section + you might have a different view on my little problem :( i'd be grateful to have your opinion on this.. i am a serious person, i am honest and open-minded. i just started a new job. there is a very young + international team and we keep having fun during and sometimes after work. i was open. but serious. then, one night at a party, me and this guy committed what i'd now call a mistake. i didn't think so first. i had liked him from the start. well. he seems to be well known for not keeping hands from girls. we ended up at his place after this business-event. we had sex and i spent the night with him, in his arms. what followed was unpredictable to me: next morning, we both agreed to NOT under any circumstances do anything, nor comment, at work. to just stay as before. i guess we were both afraid: i have a new job. he is also quite new at the job. problem now is that we never talked about this night since more then 4 weeks! but we meet everyday in the office! this is crazy :( he did try to contact me once a few days after, but we didn't meet. we talked over the phone + he told me he is kind of nervous when i'm around in the office. so am i. it is not the same like before + this is sad. i used to like him a lot. not complicated. now we started to avoid each other. lately i asked him for a beer or coffee so we could just hang out a bit (and speak). he agreed and acted positive. but he suggested not to meet stright away, but in a week's time. i knew that HE had suggested a day when it was not good for him to meet as he has extra-classes that night AND we had a business event on the very same night. well. how does this sound like? do you think it was on purpose so as not to meet me? we did not fix a new date again. i feel it's not only my duty to ask him out. i don't do anything for now. would you do the same or try to talk again? please help me with your advice *thanks*   Been trying to answer questions and only able to answer 3 yesterday Cannot reply to any today- The screen keeps telling me that they are on a coffee break (many times) - LOL Funny - cause when I go to other International Answers sections I am able to answer. Just not this one... OK - only a test ;)) Thanks for your patience not sure if I understand the Canadian comment 100% ??? The coffee breaks? Hey....all I know is that others were answering and posting and I could not - for multiple times. Not complaining - no problemo. Just got tired of typing for no reason - haha...oh well, all is great now!!!!   it is one of those International instant coffees. they have flavors like cafe mocha and irish cream and french vanilla cafe and many others.   I mean, until how many kilos as I'm sending different packets/samples of coffee - beans and ground. I think I got an accumulated / approx. 1 1/2 kilo all in all from different shops. :D   I now troll in and around the Kingston Harbour (Jamaica) catching mostly small Kingfish, Jacks and Barracudas, all under 20lbs. I want to start catching much larger fish so I will be trolling 4 miles out on the edge, between deep and shallow. I can only troll two lines. I have a #3 planer, Drone spoons (#4, #2.5), Pet Spoons #18, Rapala CD14, X-Rap Magnum 15, Boone Cairns Swimmer, MirrOlure 111MR diving plug (25 feet), Braid Runner 5" model, with one standup rod (Penn Slammer) paired with Penn Special Senator 114H 6/0, one all roller trolling rod with Penn International II 50TW reel. All reels spooled with 50lb Ande, Penn 50TW with 850 yards, Penn 114H with 475 yards. How do I rig the lures? (I now use haywire twists to attach 18" single strand coffee steel leader directly to lures then clip ball-bearing snap swivel attached to main line onto the leader. #5 44lb coffee wire) What length wire leader is best for the larger fish? What test wire leader or mono leader? Do I need to double the last section of main line? Should I buy other lures and what should they be? I don't mind risking the Pet spoons on mono leader since they are cheap.   I feel like such a retard like I cant do anything right. In my Hospitality class most of the people are foreign international students and they seem to excel far better than I am despite they cant speak proper English. I cant follow simple instructions well n
