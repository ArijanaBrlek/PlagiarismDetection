The classes of humans consume in the largest quantities and which provide bulk energy are , , and . and atmospheric also must be consumed in large quantities, but are not always considered "food" or "nutrients". chemical compounds carbohydrates proteins fats Water oxygen

The remaining vitamins, minerals, or elements, are called because they are required in relatively small quantities. micronutrients

consist of a molecule with three attached. Fatty acids are unbranched chains, connected by single bonds alone () or by both double and single bonds (). Fats are needed to keep functioning properly, to insulate body organs against shock, to keep body temperature stable, and to maintain healthy skin and hair. The body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed ) and the diet must supply these.

The strip of a green alga () along this shore indicates that there is a nearby source of nutrients (probably nitrates or ammonia from a small estuary).

The chemical elements consumed in the greatest quantities by plants are , , and . These are present in the environment in the form of and ; energy is provided by . , , , and are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, these are the elemental for plants, often represented by the CHNOPS. Usually they are sourced from inorganic (e.g. , , , , ) or organic (e.g. , , ) , although elemental of nitrogen and (especially) oxygen are often used. carbon hydrogen oxygen water carbon dioxide sunlight Nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur macronutrients acronym carbon dioxide water nitrate phosphate sulfate carbohydrates lipids proteins compounds diatomic molecules
Other chemical elements are also necessary to carry out various life processes and build structures; see and for more information. fertilizer micronutrient
Some of these are considered macronutrients in certain organisms. The acronym C. HOPKiN'S CaFe Mg (to be used as C. Hopkins coffee mug) is used by some students to remember the list as: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Potassium (K), Nitrogen, Sulfur, Calcium, Iron (Fe), and Magnesium (Mg). Silicon, chloride, sodium, copper, zinc, and molybdenum are sometimes also included, but are in other cases considered micronutrients.
Oversupply of plant nutrients in the environment can cause excessive plant and growth. , as this process is called, may cause imblances in population numbers and other nutrients that can be harmful to certain species. For example, an can deplete the available for fish to breathe. Causes include from or from farms (carrying excess agricultural fertilizer). Nitrogen and phosphorus are most commonly the in growth, and thus the most likely to trigger eutrophication when introduced artificially. algae Eutrophication algal bloom oxygen water pollution sewage runoff limiting factor
[] edit Essential and non-essential nutrients
Main article: Essential nutrient
Nutrients are frequently categorized as essential or nonessential. are unable to be synthesized internally (either at all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism from its environment. Essential nutrients
For humans, these include , , , and certain . and are also essential for human survival, but are generally not considered "food" when consumed in isolation. essential fatty acids essential amino acids vitamins dietary minerals Oxygen water
Humans can derive energy from a wide variety of , , , and , and can synthesize other needed amino acids from the essential nutrients. fats carbohydrates proteins ethanol
Non-essential nutrients can still have a significant impact on health, whether beneficial or toxic. For example, most is not absorbed by the human digestive tract, but is important in digestion and absorption of otherwise harmful substances. Interest has recently increased in , which include many non-essential nutrients which may have health benefits. dietary fiber phytochemicals
