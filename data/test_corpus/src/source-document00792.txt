Take a scenic drive up to Mead Orchards () at 15 Scism Road in Tivoli, near Bard College. It’s a family-run, 180-acre fruit orchard and vegetable farm around since 1916. They grow nearly 40 varieties of apples, as well as peaches, pears, plums, cherries, strawberries and other berries.  You also can choose from their wide variety of delicious greens, summer vegetables, winter squashes, pumpkins and decorative gourds.     www.meadorchards.com
Heading south toward Red Hook, stop for a leisurely afternoon respite at Gigi Market (), followed by a wine tasting and tour at Alison Wines & Vineyard (), another stop along the Dutchess Wine Trail.  Both are located on picturesque Pitcher Lane adjacent to Greig Farm (), where you’ll have another opportunity to pick-your-own fruits, vegetables and flowers amid the scenic rural landscape.
