Coronary risk profile
Definition
A coronary risk profile is a battery of blood tests to measure your and triglyceride levels. The profile can help determine your risk for . cholesterol heart disease

How the Test is Performed
Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.
Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.
Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.
In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.
The blood is sent to a laboratory, where the following are measured:
Additional blood tests, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may be added to the profile in some laboratories.
How to Prepare for the Test
You should not eat or drink anything except water for 9-12 hours before having your blood drawn.
How the Test Will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.
Why the Test is Performed
The coronary risk profile is most often done:
As a screening examination to determine your general health
To monitor you if you have a history of heart problems or other disorders related to atherosclerosis
To determine how well diet and medications are controlling your high cholesterol
Normal Results
HDL: greater than 40 mg/dL
Total cholesterol: less than 200 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 10 - 150 mg/dL
VLDL: 2 - 38 mg/dL
Note: mg/dL = milligrams per deciliter
The ideal values for patients with known coronary artery disease are different from those for patients without coronary disease. High values of HDL (60 or higher) are protective and are therefore desirable.
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal values may be a sign that you are at increased risk for atherosclerosis and related disorders, including heart disease.
Risks
There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
