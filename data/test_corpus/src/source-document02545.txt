 Description
 
Did you know that there have already been 42 presidents of the United States of America? Did you know that John Fitzgerald Kennedy was 35th in turn and his presidency lasted since 1961 to 1963 when he was assasinated in an open limousine. This small collection will help you find answers to some of these questions and help you remember all US presidents.
A new version expected as soon as US courts figure out if George W. Bush or Albert Gore jr. should become the 43rd president :)
