General Route Description The Capitol Corridor lies in a generally northeast-southwest direction in northern California linking San Jose and Auburn with stops in Oakland, Davis, Sacramento, Roseville, and Rocklin. Amtrak motor coaches connect the Capitols to Reno and Carson City, Nevada, Redding and Red Bluff, the Central Coast as far south as Santa Barbara, and the Northwest California Coast including Eureka.
Operational management of Amtrak's CapitolCorridor was transferred from the State's Department of Transportation to the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Board (CCJPB) July 1, 1998. Although Amtrak continues to operate the service and Caltrans continues to provide operating funds, Amtrak will be working with the CCJPB and BART, rather than with Caltrans, who initiated the service in 1996.
Any future improvements to the service will be the responsibility of the CCJPB and BART. Future inquiries should be addressed to BART (their management force) at 510-464-6995 or visit their website: http://www.amtrakcapitols.com
