        Proper oral hygiene does not just save your teeth and gums, it could save your life. The bacteria from gum disease enters the blood stream and contributes to the clogging of arteries in the heart. Researchers have found people with periodontal disease are almost twice as likely to suffer from coronary artery disease as those without periodontal disease. Studies have also shown periodontal diseases are linked to strokes and those who suffered from a stroke were more likely to have an oral infection. Taking the time to properly brush and floss has a direct effect on the rest of your health.
        Often people with missing or problem teeth automatically opt for a bridge or similar solution. The problem is in order to do this the surrounding teeth are compromised and at greater risk for their own problems. Choosing an implant fixes the affected tooth without a negative impact on the surrounding teeth. When considering the affects it will have on surrounding teeth, the long term costs associated with fixing those problems, and the more natural look and feel of an implant can prove to be a wise choice.
        For those who need a crown, new technology in our office means a crown replacement can be done in one visit and often in less than 45 minutes. So if youve been putting it off your excuses are gone!Please give us a call to see how you can improve your oral hygiene, review available treatment options, or get that crown done quickly!

Additionally, we can examine such common neurological problems as carpel tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, muscle disorders, and pinched nerves in the spine. We are one of the few offices in the Bay Area with tests to assess the neurological integrity of hearing, vision, and sensation. By using a transcranial doppler we can examine blood flow in brain arteries and are useful in detecting strokes emanating from the heart or other arteries, usually only performed at select academic stroke centers. All of this advanced technology is provided in a comfortable, warm, and nurturing environment in the new Butterfield Professional Center. Feel free to drop by for a visit anytime!

        Over 200,000 people each year are hospitalized for the flu, millions suffer the agonizing effects and possibly miss time from work. But there are ways to prevent spreading and catching the flu. Everyone should get the flu shot, especially young children and older adults as they are at the greatest risk. It is best to get vaccinated by November, but the shot can be effective taken as late and February. If you do get the flu, cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze and avoid going to work, school or other places you can spread it. Healthy eating and exercise habits will help fight off the flu naturally, but the best prevention is washing your hands with soap or using an anti-bacterial gel when washing is not possible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with hands that have not been washed. For more information on the flu vaccination, general health tips, or information on medications please call or drop by!
