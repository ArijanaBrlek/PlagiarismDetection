Lectures
The purpose of this lecture series is to provide individuals access to basic information regarding the horse's foot. These lectures were originally part of courses taught to first and second year veterinary students and graduate students at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M University.
Each lecture included has been adapted from existing lectures and will be updated as new data becomes available. Lectures are organized by topics: anatomy, conformation, biomechanics, growth and metabolism, circulation, and pathologies. Within each topic, the initial lecture will focus on the necessary basic information and then proceed to lectures of increasing depth of material and narrower focus. Submission of questions and comments regarding the lecture materials is encouraged.
The following is an outline of the Lectures and their content.
