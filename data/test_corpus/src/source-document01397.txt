State Flag
The official state flag of Arizona was officially adopted on February 17, 1917. It was designed by Colonel Charles W. Harris (adjutant general and chief administrative officer of Arizona) and was first sewn by Nan D. Hayden.
The 13 yellow and red rays represent both the Sun's rays and the original 13 colonies of the United States of America. The colors red and yellow are used because they were the colors of the flag of the Spanish conquistadors led by , who entered Arizona in 1540 (looking for the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola). The copper-colored star in the middle represents copper mining, since Arizona produces more copper than any other state in the USA. Francisco Vasquez de Coronado
Arizona was the 48th state in the USA; it was admitted in 1912 (it had been part of Mexico before the Mexican War).
