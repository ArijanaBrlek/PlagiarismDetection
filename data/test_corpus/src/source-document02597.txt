Pasta Fagioli
August 19, 2008
I know I know! It’s only August and already I’m making soup. I do this every year. I start getting the itch for cooler weather around August/September and I always start making Fall-ish foods way too early. I do it every year so get used to it! I guess it’s my way of willing the Fall to come sooner. If only it really worked. Fall doesn’t show its face around here until well into October or November. hmph
I saw this recipe on a while back and pasta fagioli being one of my favorite soups, I put it on my list to try. Now I knew I’d be the only one eating this (remember my husband? the bean hater?) so I figured I’d make the whole recipe and freeze half for later. And it certainly didn’t disappoint. I just had a big bowl for lunch and it was great! In fact, I think I ate too much. I’m absolutely about to pop. I guess that’s a good sign though. If you like pasta fagioli, give this a shot. You won’t be sorry! Chelle’s blog

His and Hers
July 31, 2008
My husband and I are pretty much alike. We like the same tv shows, the same movies, the same home decor, and the same music. The one thing we normally don’t agree on is food. I love fruit, vegetables, low-fat yogurt, and pretty much anything good for you. He doesn’t. He loves pasta with cream sauce and cheeseburgers. Oh and don’t forget his relationship with Lil’ Debbie. And the differences don’t stop there. We are never able to order a pizza without doing half and half. Most of the time when I make pizza at home it’s the same way. Last night was no different. I had decided I wanted to use up some of my basil and I had some fresh tomatoes. I thought a margherita pizza would be great but I knew my husband wouldn’t touch it. So I decided to do spinach, pesto, and feta on his side. Both sides turned out great. And it was a quick dinner because I already had the dough in the freezer from when I had made some about a month ago. There really is no recipe for this. Very simple but really good!
Margherita Pizza
1 medium tomato, thinly sliced
1/2 cup basil leaves, washed and dried
mozzarella cheese (as much as you want…I would never tell you how much cheese to put on your pizza.)
olive oil, about 1 Tbsp
2 cloves of garlic, pressed or finely minced
crust of your choice (I used ) this recipe
Combine the garlic and olive oil in a bowl. Brush your crust with the garlic and olive oil. Put a thin layer of cheese on the crust, to keep it from getting soggy from the tomatoes. Next, do a layer of tomatoes. Then comes the basil leaves. Top with additional mozzarella. Bake at 450 for 12-14 min or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
Baked Shrimp with Feta and Tomato Basil Orzo
July 25, 2008
Whoa, the name of this recipe is a mouthful, but I couldn’t think of of any other way to describe it other than, well, what it is. I was first inspired to make this when I saw on . The idea sort of rolled around in my head for a while because I wasn’t exactly sure how I wanted to make it. I had seen someone on Food Network make a sauce using crushed grape tomatoes and I was toying with the idea of incorporating that into this dish. So, I’ve had it on my menu for a couple weeks, but it sort of kept being pushed further and further down the list. Tonight I finally decided to bite the bullet and make it. this recipe Elly’s blog
It’s always a little scary for me when I go into the kitchen to make up a recipe as I go. It’s scary for my husband too because of the mounds of dishes I create for him to wash while figuring out my recipe for a dish. I always end up running around like a chicken thinking of things I want to add to the recipe. Sometimes it works out for me and other times it turns into a mini disaster. Luckily, this turned out very good! My husband really enjoyed it and he’s always a bit leary of things I just concoct out of my head. Now let’s see if I remember what all I put in. : P
Baked Shrimp with Feta and Tomato Basil Orzo
14-16 medium shrimp (give or take, cleaned and deveined-I used frozen uncooked)
1/4-1/2 cup chicken broth
1 large clove garlic, minced (Use 2 if they are small)
2 Tbsp fresh basil, chopped (or 2 tsp dried basil)
1 cup grape tomatoes, washed
2 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp each salt and pepper (or to taste)
crumbled feta cheese
Preheat oven to 400. While the oven is preheating, boil water for the orzo and cook until just al dente. Set aside. In a skillet over medium heat, add 2 Tbsp olive oil, enough to barely cover the bottom of the pan. Add the minced garlic and grape tomatoes. Stir the tomatoes around to coat in the olive oil. Let cook about 2 minutes and add about 1/4 cup chicken broth. Let cook another 3 minutes. Press one of the tomatoes with a fork to see if it pops. Continuing mashing all the tomatoes to make a sauce. Add salt, pepper, and chopped basil and stir. Add additional chicken broth if the tomato sauce looks to thick/dry. Stir in the uncooked shrimp and let cook about 1 minute. Stir in the orzo. Pour into a baking dish or into individual serving dishes. Top with feta, as much as you like, and bake for about 10 minutes or until feta begins to soften and shrimp are pink.
Makes about 3 servings.
I also made some baked creamed spinach to go along side our main dish. I’ll spare you the pictures because creamed spinach just doesn’t photograph well. But it was really good. I promise! I’ve had this recipe saved for a while and I’m not sure who or where I got it from. If you happen to know, please let me know! Thanks.
CREAMED SPINACH
1/2 cup heavy cream (or sub. half and half)(with my alterations)
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg ()I omitted

Bunches and Bunches of Basil!
July 6, 2008
Remember ? I started this little herb garden the end of May hoping for the best since my track record with growing things isn’t so good. Well I am happy to report that since then my basil plant has more than doubled in size! It’s seriously taking over! I may actually have to move it to another pot so my poor little parsley can have some room to grow. And while I’m happy to have thriving, basil, I had to find something to do with all of it. So I decided to make what else? Pesto! I had made this recipe at a Pampered Chef party before and it was really good so I decided to go with that. I just doubled the recipe but you could easily triple or quadruple it if you want to make more. Here’s how I made it. this living
The Pampered Chef Basil Walnut Pesto
1 cup lightly packed fresh basil
1/4 cup toasted walnuts
1 oz. grated fresh Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
2 garlic cloves
*pinch of salt (I added this)
(I made mine in the food processor but the original instructions involve utilizing several of the Pampered Chef products. I also doubled this recipe.)
Begin by toasting the walnuts in a skillet over med/lo heat, about 5 minutes or until you can smell the nuts toasting. Wash and dry the basil leaves and place into a food processor. Add the toasted walnuts and pulse until you have a coarse paste. Add in the grated parmesan and garlic cloves. Again, pulse until all ingredients are uniform. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil. Taste for seasoning and add a pinch of salt if needed.
*Doubled recipe makes about 3/4 cup
*You can divide this pesto up in ice trays and freeze. Once frozen, remove from ice trays and store in a freezer bag for easy use in other recipes.

Garlic and Herb Roasted Pork
June 3, 2008
As I was wandering the aisles of the grocery store last week looking for orzo, I came across couscous on the shelf. I had never had it before so I decided I’d pick some up to try this week. I opted for the pre-seasoned roasted garlic and olive oil kind since this would be my first time making it. So I stuck it in the cabinet and sort of forgot about it. Tonight, I was trying to think of a side for my pork roast and then I remembered that I had bought the couscous so I figured, what the heck, I’ll give it a try. I figured it would be pretty boring on its own so I decided to add about a 1/4 cup of chopped spinach and a tablespoon of lemon juice to it. I had seen this on a blog earlier this week (although I can’t remember which one). I’m pretty sure there was more involved in that recipe, but since I was using the already seasoned couscous, I just left it at that. I have to say it was pretty good and even my picky husband ate it, but I wouldn’t say it was my favorite thing ever. But even if it hadn’t been good, the roasted pork loin I made would have more than made up for it. It was so moist, flavorful and delicious. I’m really enjoying coming up with ways to use the fresh herbs I’m growing and this recipe couldn’t be simpler. It’s definitely quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal.
Garlic and Herb Roasted Pork Loin
2 lb pork loin
1 Tbsp chopped parsley
1 tsp dried thyme (I didn’t have any fresh)
1 tsp Pampered Chef citrus basil seasoning (you could omit this but I really like it)
1/2 tsp salt
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil plus 2 more Tbsp
Begin by cutting 4-5 slits diagonally across the top of the pork loin about 1/2 ” deep. Sprinkle the citrus basil seasoning, salt and pepper on the pork roast. Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl to form a paste. Rub the paste over the top and bottom of the roast, making sure to rub it into the slits as well. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour and up to 1 day. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil to a dutch oven or other heavy bottomed pan and heat over medium high heat. Place the pork roast in the pan and sear on all sides. Place the pan in the preheated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes or until the internal temp is 160-165F. Remove from the oven and place aluminum foil over the roast. Let set for about 10 minutes. The temperature will rise another 5-10 degrees. Slice and serve.
Shrimp Carbonara
May 31, 2008
Do you ever see a recipe and instantly know you have to try it? That was the case with this one. I was sitting at home one lazy Sunday afternoon watching the Food Network and saw Giada make this on her show. I’ve never had any sort of carbonara, but I instantly knew I wanted to try this dish. It just looked so flavorful. Plus it was the perfect excuse to use some of the fresh basil I just planted. This dish tasted amazing! I changed it up a bit by adding the shrimp and omitting the fried egg on top but still the basil aioli was awesome and full of flavor! Another point for Giada on this one!
