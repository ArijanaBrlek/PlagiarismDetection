What Shade of Red/White/Blue
The official specification for federal procurements of U.S. flags is set by the General Services Administration. At the Defense Technology Information Center website is GSA "Federal Specification, Flag, National, United States of America and Flag, Union Jack," DDD-F-416E, dated November 27, 1981. It specifies the colors by reference to "Standard Color Cards of America" maintained by the Color Association of the United States, Inc. This is a color system designed for textile use - appropriate, since flags are made of cloth! The specifications are:       Cable No. 70180    Old Glory Red       Cable No. 70001    White       Cable No. 70075    Old Glory Blue Various sources give different Pantone equivalencies for these colors. The most plausibly authoritative are those provided on miscellaneous American Embassy websites, including American Embassy London. It gives the red as PMS 193 and the blue as PMS 282. On the other hand, Texas state law says the Texas state flag has the same colors as the U.S. flag, and that they are red PMS193 and blue PMS281. It should be noted that flags produced other than for the executive branch of the government are not bound by any of this. , 25 September 2001 www.dtic.mil
