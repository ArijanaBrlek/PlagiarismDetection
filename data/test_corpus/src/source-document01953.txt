What is a Shooting Star?
If youve never seen a shooting star, its worth going out on a clear night to watch for them. A shooting star is actually a meteor, a piece of space rock thats passing through the Earths atmosphere. As the meteor encounters our atmosphere, it begins to heat up and then to glow, leaving a trail of fire across the sky. Most meteors burn up before they reach the surface of our planet.
Two good times to watch for shooting stars are late August and mid-November, when annual meteor showers decorate the sky. Check online for the dates of this years Perseid meteor shower (in August) and Leonid meteor shower (in November). On an ordinary night, the best time to look is shortly before dawn.

Meanings and Legends

Sometimes the expression is also used to suggest that the person will burn out before too long. In some cultures, however, a meteor is thought to bring bad luck, or to reveal that someone has died.
In one Native American legend, a shooting star symbolizes a young girl, far from her native land, trying to get home. In another, its a coyote who had climbed up to dance among the stars. Asian legends say that these lights in the sky are serpents, which may bring good luck or bad.
