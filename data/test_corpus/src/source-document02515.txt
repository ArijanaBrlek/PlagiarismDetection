"‘Skeletal fluorosis’ is a condition associated with prolonged accumulation of fluoride resulting in fragile bones having low tensile strength. It affects the joints as well as the bones. In its most severe stages it becomes a crippling disability that has a major public health and socio-economic impact, affecting millions of people in various regions of Africa, China and India."It is not easily recognizable till advanced stage.

"In spite of this distinctive clinical picture of advanced fluorosis, the earlier stages of the disease are more difficult to recognize. The first reliable diagnostic sign is increased bone density in X-ray examination, but in some early cases early bone changes are not radiologically detectable."The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and not obviously linked to fluoride. The onset of fluorosis leads to tingling sensations in the hands and feet, pain similar to arthritic pain in the joints and the lower back, stiffness, and motor weakness.SOURCE: Groth, E. (1973). .

In some instances, they grow to such an extent as to block joint movement ('blocking arthrosis'). The joint block can also be induced by calcification of the periarticular ligament. ""Fluoric Arthropathies: Around joints, thick marginal osteophytes develop.The most common sites of articular involvement are the hips, the sacroiliac, elbow and knee joints. In older persons, the vetebral column is commonly affected. Advanced stages of the disease show atrophy and ulceration of joint cartilage.

"In general, the metabolic patterns of osteoblasts, ameloblasts, odontoblasts, and chrondoblasts are sufficiently similar so that disturbances of cartilage might be expected... The fluoride levels and remodeling circumstances necessary to produce cartilage alteration in cattle - if it occurs - remain to be established."To date, any observed in fluoride-treated cattle has been regarded as an unrelated process. However, excessive remodeling of the subchondral plate and cancellous end of the bone, such as occurs in osteofluorosis, will eventually lead to remodeling of the articular cartilage. Excessive cartilage remodeling leads to of normal joints. Therefore, both the mechanical effects of fluoride induced remodeling and the direct action of fluoride on cartilage cells might alter cartilage. osteoarthritis osteoarthritis
