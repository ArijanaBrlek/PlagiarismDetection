Tourist Attractions
Singapore is a haven for culture vultures and a paradise for brand loyalists and hagglers. While the Arab Street brings alive the essence of Islam in its Mosques, shops and cuisines, the Orchard Street could easily merge into the Las Vegas landscape. If Little India strives to offer a comprehensive taste of the Indian culture, the Colonial Singapore keeps intact the city blueprint that has made Singapore what it is today - a lively and fast-paced business leader in the world.
Events
Events and festivals in Singapore showcase a glorious confluence of cultures and religions. This blend in the eastern and western traditions can be seen in its art and architecture too. Besides celebrating all the major religious Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists festivals, Singapore is also an exciting place to be during Thaipusam in Feb, Singapore Food Festival in April and the Great Singapore Sale in June.
