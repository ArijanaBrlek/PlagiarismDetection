Tongasat's Services
 Service Offering
Tongasat is able to offer a number of services to our clients to support their satellite network orbit and spectrum needs.
Our Portfolio of Orbital Positions and Associated Spectrum
Over the past 10 years, Tongasat has, of its own initiative, submitted to ITU through the Tongan administration a portfolio of satellite network filings that are available for licensing by our clients.
These filings include 9 geostationary satellite orbital positions offering C, Ku, X, Ka, L and S-bands and a number of non-geostationary network filings.
Although a number of these filings are already in use, we are very happy to explore the possible use of unused filings with potential clients.
Orbit and Associated Spectrum Filing Service
If our existing portfolio of orbital positions and associated spectrum do not meet your needs then why not use Tonga as the ITU Member administration through which new satellite network filings can be made to the ITU?
Because of its exclusive agency agreement with the Tongan government, Tongasat is able to offer a satellite network filing service to our clients which, because of Tonga's low-impact regulatory regime, is an attractive prospect to operators otherwise faced with lengthy and bureaucratic domestic regulatory requirements in their home countries.
Tongasat can offer a full-service package, whereby we exploit our significant expertise in this field to prepare, submit to ITU and coordinate the satellite network filings for your project.   Alternatively, if you have a filing already prepared then we are also happy to submit that filing to ITU on your behalf.   We offer a totally flexible service and are ready and willing to tailor our offering to the specific needs of any client.
Satellite Capacity
Tongasat is already operating its , with a over South-eastern  Europe, North Africa and the Middle East in the C-band, at our 70E orbital position, and we have active plans to further develop both this orbital slot and other of our slots.    ESIAFI-1 satellite footprint
We are able to offer capacity on ESIAFI-1 on a highly competitive basis and hope soon to be in a position to offer capacity from other orbital positions.
