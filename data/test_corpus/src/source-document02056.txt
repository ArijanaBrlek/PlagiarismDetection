NPR reassigned host Bob Edwards to make way for a two-host setup intended to strengthen the show's news coverage, said Jay Kernis, NPR's senior v.p. of programming.Morning Edition
An additional host will allow for more flexibility in handling breaking news and preparing for future programs, he said. Updating the show, which feeds at 5 a.m. Eastern Time and repeats until noon, will be easier with two hosts, Kernis said.
The arrangement will also free hosts to report from the field — giving them first-hand experience with news that will come across in their hosting work, according to Kernis and others. Some observers in public radio had criticized Edwards for sounding disengaged.

Responding to listeners and public radio programmers who asked why NPR would mess with success, Kernis said the goal was to build on the network's achievements.
"isn't broken," he said. "The question is, how do you grow it? . . . How do you replenish it? How do you take it in new directions?"Morning Edition
The show's growing demands
NPR's review of its programming is prompted in part by the $200 million bequest from late billionaire Joan Kroc.

Programmers inside and outside NPR had been calling for changes to for years. Edwards briefly had a co-host when the show began but had hosted solo in the two decades since.Morning Edition
Kernis, who helped create in his first stint at NPR, said that while working for CBS News after leaving the network he sometimes heard from former co-workers that the show was such a burden it needed two hosts. "And I said, don't do it. I said, 'Bob works solo and that's how he works best. Do not do this to him.'"Morning Edition
"When I got back to NPR [in 2001], it became clear that NPR's news presentation needed to change," Kernis added. "It was no longer acceptable to be late on a story and call it analysis. It was no longer acceptable to miss a major story or not cover it in depth."
During Edwards' recent vacations NPR experimented with a dual-host format using Inskeep and Montagne. The network asked John Stark, g.m. of KNAU-FM in Flagstaff, Ariz., for feedback.
"I think that with a co-host NPR ran the risk of it sounding contrived or corny or too clever," he said. "No. It sounded very much in keeping with what we expect of host performance in the shows."
Stark welcomes the change to and believes Edwards will contribute valuable reports as a senior correspondent, as have Susan Stamberg and Juan Williams, both former hosts who now have similar wide-ranging jobs, he said.Morning Edition

To others, Edwards has sounded out of step with the show. He sometimes conducted brilliant interviews, said Tom DuVal, g.m. of WMRA-FM in Harrisonburg, Va. But "there were times I felt he was just reading questions and not really engaging that much with the interviewee," DuVal said.
Reports from hosts in the field will improve , said Eric Nuzum, director of programming and operations at WKSU-FM in Kent, Ohio. NPR asked Nuzum last April to evaluate the program. He pushed for two hosts.Morning Edition
"There's a different expectation for a host of a program than maybe there was in the past," Nuzum says. "There should be a sense of engagement and passion about the world they're talking about, and I think that as a listener I enjoy knowing that this person understands the world because they've been there. As a station person . . . I really trust someone who is out there doing that kind of work."

Another Rukeysergate?
Edwards won't be a co-host of the new because he insisted on hosting alone, Kernis said. Edwards declined to speak with but confirmed in a interview that he didn't want a co-pilot.Morning EditionCurrentLos Angeles Times
"I'd gotten used to working alone," he said. "It is a vanity thing, I am ashamed to say, but we do have egos and that is why we go on the air."
Edwards also took the dismissal personally. "I think he's tired of listening to me," he said of Kernis, in a article.Washington Post
For some observers, the departure of Edwards, 56, suggested a parallel to Maryland Public Television's 2002 , then host of its .

"It could be great," said WMRA's DuVal. "We may look back on this in five years and say, wow, that was a sea change for and for public radio — we're glad we went that direction. Or we could look back on it and say, 'So what's a whole lot different?'"Morning Edition
