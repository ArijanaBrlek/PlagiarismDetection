Friends of the Preborn
Proverbs 23:1-3 states: The press release below is a living example of this verse. It is why the pro-lifers in the legislative realm have often been so inept and have so often betrayed and stabbed-in-the-back the preborn babies. We will go to DC, not to entertain, praise, and parley with the government leaders there, rather we will go to call them to repentance for allowing the cruel deeds of the abortionist to continue on unhindered and protected by the State. Please remember to pray for our efforts there during Inaugural Week! PS. To join us out on the streets in our efforts there, call 414-462-3399. : Missionaries to the Preborn P.O.

"When you sit down to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you; and put a knife to your throat, if you be a man given to appetite. Be not desirous of his dainties; for they are deceitful meat."

Pro-Life and Pro-Family Church Leaders to Celebrate at Bush Inaugural To: National Desk Contact: Rev. Rob Schenck, president of the National Clergy Council , 202-546-8329 extension 106, 703-447-7686 cell WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 /Christian Wire Service / -- On Inauguration Day, January 20, pro-life and pro-family church leaders from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions will stage a rare event combining prayers of thanksgiving with partying the night away. Beginning at 7:00 p.m., Faith and Action, the National Clergy Council and Priests for Life will host 50 VIP guests from around the country at their Victorian-era Capitol Hill row house just a block from the US Capitol. Earlier in the day the group will personally witness the swearing in of George W. Bush to a second term and watch the Inaugural Parade along Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. The soiree will include both ordained and lay church leaders who played key roles in mobilizing their constituencies to turn out an unprecedented pro-life and pro-traditional marriage vote on Election Day. Special guest will be Evangelical author and former Time Magazine bureau chief David Aikman who will autograph copies of Man of Faith, his biography of George Bush. The program includes music, food and elegant horse and carriage rides. A heated tent in the building's garden will include a large-screen television so guests can watch the President and First Lady dance at the main ball. The highlight of the evening, though, will be a special prayer service where guests will offer prayers of thanksgiving for the election outcome and intercession for Mr. Bush and members of his administration as they lead the country during the next four years. Special emphasis will be placed on asking God to give wisdom to Mr. Bush as he selects replacements to serve on the Supreme Court, located immediately across the street. Members of the media (on assignment) are invited to attend but must call first to arrange entrance. Contact Dane Rose at Faith and Action, 202-546-8329.
