The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) now collects the local vehicle registration fee (often referred to as a county or city sticker or license) in conjunction with state vehicle registration fees for localities that are participants in the Local Vehicle Registration Program. Under this program, when you register a vehicle or renew a registration for a vehicle garaged in a , you will be billed for the state and local registration fees at the same time. participating locality
In the past you were required to display a county, city or town sticker, decal or license as proof that you had paid your local vehicle registration fees and/or personal property taxes on your vehicle. Localities participating in the Local Vehicle Registration Program have the option to eliminate their requirement for a sticker or license, and allow the DMV license plates and registration card to serve as proof of local registration.
Under this program, localities continue to determine their fee schedules, exemptions and discounts. DMV merely collects the fee for the locality. Once DMV collects state and local vehicle registration fees, DMV remits the local registration fees to participating localities.
Since the local vehicle registration fees for participating localities are collected at the same time as the DMV vehicle registration fees, customers with a vehicle garaged in a participating locality have a number of service outlets available to them to renew their combined state and local registration. These include mail; the Internet at www.dmvnow.com; telephone at 1-888-337-4782; and at DMV offices.
At the present time, the City of Virginia Beach is the only locality participating. To find out more about what this means to Virginia Beach citizens, visit the Virginia Beach web site at . http://www.vbgov.com/dept/cor/
