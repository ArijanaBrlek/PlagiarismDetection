Belonging to , the original Telstar was part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, , , the British , and the to develop experimental over the . Bell Labs held a contract with NASA, reimbursing the agency three million dollars for each of the two launches, independent of success. The US ground station was in , built by Bell Labs. The main British ground station was at in southwestern England, and it was used by the . It was the international coordinator and the standards 525/405 conversion equipment (filling a large room) was researched and developed by the BBC and located in the , London.

The satellite was built by a team at Bell Telephone Laboratories, including who created the project, who invented the transponder used in the satellite, and who designed the transistors and solar panels for it. The satellite is roughly spherical, measures 34.5 inches (880 mm) in length, and weighs about 170 pounds (77 kg). Its dimensions were limited by what would fit in one of NASA's . Telstar was spin-stabilized, and its outer surface was covered with to generate electrical power. The power produced was a tiny 14 watts.

Telstar was equipped with a which received signals from a ground station, then amplified and retransmitted the signals. The transmissions were made from a series of around the satellite's "equator". The electronics switched the feed horns as the satellite rotated. helical antenna microwave feed horns
Unlike most of today's communications satellites, Telstar was on an elliptical orbit, which meant the ground antenna had to track the satellite as it came around the world approximately every 2.5 hours. Because the transmitting and receiving radio systems on board the satellite were not nearly as powerful or capable as ones on today's satellites, the ground antenna had to be huge. Morimi Iwama and Jan Norton of Bell Laboratories were in charge of designing and building the electrical portions of the system that steered the antennas. The aperture of the antennas were 3,600 square feet (330 m). The antennas were 177 feet (54 m) long and weighed 380 tons. The antennas were housed in radomes the size of a 14-story office building. The challenge was to steer the huge antenna to track the satellite that moved up to 1.5 degrees per second with a pointing error of less than a .06 degree.[] clarification needed 2
Launched by aboard a from on July 10, 1962, Telstar 1 was the first privately sponsored space launch. A medium-altitude satellite, Telstar was placed in an (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), inclined at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the equator, with about 1000 km from Earth and apogee about 6000 km from Earth. Because of this, its availability for signals was limited to 20 minutes in each orbit that passed over the . NASA Delta rocket Cape Canaveral elliptical orbit perigee [4] transatlantic Atlantic Ocean

Telstar 1 relayed its first television pictures (of a flag outside ) to , France, on the date of its launch. Almost two weeks later, on July 23, it relayed the first live transatlantic television signal. The first broadcast was to have been remarks by , but the signal was acquired before the President was ready, so the lead-in time was filled with a short segment of a televised game between the and the at . (.) The batter was seen hitting the ball to the right fielder . During that evening, Telstar 1 also relayed the first call to be transmitted through space, and it successfully transmitted faxes, data, and both live and taped television, including the first live transmission of television across an ocean (to Pleumeur-Bodou).

Telstar 1, which had ushered in a new age of the benevolent use of technology, became a victim of technology during the . The day before Telstar 1 was launched, the United States had tested a high-altitude nuclear bomb (called ) which energized the Earth's where Telstar 1 went into orbit. This vast increase in radiation, combined with subsequent high-altitude blasts, including a Soviet test in October, overwhelmed Telstar's fragile transistors; it went out of service in early December, but was restarted by a workaround in early January 1963. The additional radiation associated with its return to full sunlight once again caused a transistor failure, this time irreparably, and Telstar 1 went out of service on February 21, 1963.

According to the US Space Objects Registry, Telstar 1 was still in orbit as of June 2008. [7]

These were similar to the previous Telstar satellites in name only. The later ones were much more advanced electronically and mechanically, geosynchronous satellites, and built for commercial applications, and not just experimental or developmental satellites.
The second wave of "Telstar" satellites launched with in 1983, and it was followed by Telstar 302 in 1984, and by Telstar 303 in 1985. Telstar 301
The next wave, starting with came in 1993, which was lost in 1997 due to a magnetic storm, and then Telstar 402 was launched but destroyed shortly after in 1994. It was replaced in 1995 by Telstar 402R, eventually renamed Telstar 4. Telstar 401

In 2003, Telstars 4 8 and 13 's North American fleet were sold to . Telstar 4 suffered complete failure prior to the handover.
