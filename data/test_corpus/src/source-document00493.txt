We can all agree that paying and receiving child support payments can be difficult and inconsistent. As a father paying child support like myself, I understand how money can be important to ones life. We all as parents can use a little extra cash, that is why I am recommending to all my fellow custodial and non-custodial parents a way in which you can make money online on your spare time. Making extra money is never a bad idea. You can use the extra money to buy food for the house, take the kids to the movies, save, etcbut I don have to tell you how to spend your money :-).

Child Support Laws
This information is here to guide anyone who is interested in child support in the right direction. It is here to help better understand child support in your area.
Most child support court orders will allow a non-custodial parent to be incarcerated (put in jail) if they fail to obey the law of paying child support. While incarcerated, the parents are still responsible for the amount due and future payments.A non-custodial parent can be sentenced to jail time for up to six months.
The law does not care if a non-custodial is unemployed, filing for bankruptcy, or even homeless, child support must be paid and will be enforced. Did you know that child support enforcement agencies in most states can suspend the driver's license? Not only can they suspend the driverslicense, but also any professional, occupational, or recreational license.
If the court finds that a non-custodial parent fails to obey the state child support laws, their license could be suspended after 30 days. If a non-custodial is prosecuted and sent to prison for neglecting their obligations, it will show on their criminal record as a federal offense. Delinquent child support payments also show on the credit report.
