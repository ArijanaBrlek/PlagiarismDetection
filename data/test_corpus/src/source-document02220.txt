Baked Ziti
I had a little difference of opinion with my wife in regards to this recipe. She felt that baked ziti should have ricotta cheese in it and I did not agree. We decide to go straight to the source and called my father. He said that he does not normally put ricotta in but when it is included the dish is designated Sorrentino. So there you have it; if you wish, add the optional ricotta and make Baked Ziti Sorrentino.
Serves 4-6
1 pound of ziti pasta 4 cups 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, chopped or shredded 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 1 pound ricotta cheese (optional)
Marinara Sauce
1.
Bring a pot of liberally salted water to a boil, add pasta and cook until almost al dente then strain, the pasta should be slightly undercooked.
2.
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Transfer pasta to a 3 to 4 quart baking dish. Add 2 cups of marinara sauce, 4 ounces of mozzarella, and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (if using the optional ricotta cheese add it all at this point also), and toss until well combined.
3.
Top with the remaining sauce and sprinkle on the remaining cheeses. Place the baking dish in the oven and bake until the cheese on top is melted and slightly browned, 15-20 minutes.

I must start this review off with an apology. There is no excuse for waiting until mid-August to post a review of The Perfect Scoop. If this is the first you are hearing of this excellent book on all things ice cream, then I have let over two months of prime ice cream making and eating time this summer slip through your grip. Mid-July through August is sometimes referred to as the Dog Days of Summer, but for me they are something special, the Tomato Days of Summer.
