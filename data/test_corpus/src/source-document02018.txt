Welcome to St. Louis County's newest, hippest, high-tech sport's bar! Lester's offers an impressive atmosphere matched by none in the area – a restaurant suitable for business professionals to families! Allow us to show you around the restaurant so you too can see why Lester's is the place to be! Let us first introduce you to proprietor and entrepreneur, Lester Miller – the brainchild behind Lester's. "I wanted something different, something unique – a menu offering the best East Coast flavor and an atmosphere to satisfy the biggest sports fans in America. I believe we've accomplished both!" Lester has an energizing personality and this certainly shows from the moment you see the restaurant – as well as in the menu offerings. Outside, you'll be greeted by the famous St. Louisan Stan Musial – you know, former Cardinal's player and baseball legend – not forgetting to mention life-long friend of Lester Miller. His bronze statue outside of Lester's stands 6 feet 6 inches tall and was created by none other than renowned sculptor Harry Weber (Lewis & Clark Statue, St. Louis Riverfront and Jack Buck life-size bust – a St. Louis City Landmark). Feel free to gaze at him in awe while you enjoy your meal outside on the patio. His statue is just a small indication of what awaits you inside! Inside you'll see why Lester's is the place to be. Let's stop off and have a drink at the high-tech bar so you can "soak" in the atmosphere! While sitting atop checkered flag chairs, the dark oak bar with timber-framed roof holds a Madison Square-style scoreboard and stock ticker – no information is out of your reach! This room alone boasts at least 16 of the 68 plasma screen TV's at Lester's! Did we mention that the men's restroom also boasts 2? We wouldn't want you to miss that tie-breaking homer!
Now, as you head into the main dining area you're eyes are drawn to more of Lester's massive collection of sport's memorabilia mounted on walls reminiscent of referee uniforms and the new Busch Stadium. Be our guest and have a seat in a booth and peruse the extensive menu. Don't forget to tune your personal state-of-the-art audio control system to the TV monitor of your choice! Isn't variety nice?!
From your seat in the main dining area you'll have a clear view of the open kitchen. Maybe you'll even catch sight of the Head Chef, Brad Isaak – that's him – behind the steam coming up from the holding steamers. Lester sent Isaak to the east coast for training by the former proprietor of the famous Carnegie Deli. He brought back a wealth of knowledge and has used this to create an exquisite selection! Everything is homemade, from salad dressing to the side dishes – we even brine our own meats and smoke our baby back ribs 4 1/2 hours. No shortcuts here – we want you to experience full flavor! Oh, it should be mentioned that the Hot Corned Beef and Reuben The Great sandwiches are highly recommended, as well as the baby back ribs, and don't forget the smoked beef brisket sandwich. Did we even mention the secret recipe potato pancakes? We're sure your experience at Lester's will leave you recommending your friends, family and co-workers to our unique restaurant! We're looking forward to serving you often! Thanks for stopping by!
