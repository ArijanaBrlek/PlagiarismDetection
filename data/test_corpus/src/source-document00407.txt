Homeland Defense—Protecting our freedom
Detecting the expected; discovering the unexpected. PNNL scientists and engineers have been supporting the U.S. government's national security mission for nearly four decades. Today, we are assessing the vulnerability of critical infrastructures across the nation and teaming with others to ensure our air and seaports are protected from the threat of terrorist attacks. We are training border enforcement officials worldwide to thwart the smuggling of chemical, biological or nuclear materials. We're also instructing emergency first responders in every country that houses a U.S. embassy. Whether it's discussing innovative methods to secure commerce in the Pacific Northwest and across the nation or 21st century protections for international borders, our researchers look forward to sharing with you their role in protecting our homeland.
Bioterrorism and counterterriorism—Combating the threat
In the days following September 11, a grim reality came home to Americans: Anthrax and other biological weapons can be used to kill people and disrupt the government and commerce of the United States. The threat is not new. Dangerous chemicals and disease-causing biological organisms have been used in conflicts for centuries. PNNL researchers have spent decades studying dangerous chemical and biological agents. Now they are available to tell your group about the potential threats to individuals, communities and the nation, as well as to provide an overview of the multi-faceted research PNNL is conducting to help combat the threats. They also will outline some steps individuals can take to protect themselves and their families.
Global Security—Preventing nuclear proliferation
What are the U.S., the Northwest and PNNL doing to prevent nuclear proliferation? Laboratory speakers candidly address the question of global security in the 21st century in a presentation focusing on U.S. efforts to foster nuclear nonproliferation worldwide. For example PNNL researchers participate in U.S. collaborations with nations of the former Soviet Union on warhead safety and security, safety improvements near nuclear installations and economic diversification of cities previously dependent on nuclear weapons research or production. We also partner with the University of Washington in the Pacific Northwest Center for Global Security, to provide a forum for the study of the full range of security issues, including non-proliferation issues and the impacts of environmental, economic, energy, and health conditions on global security.
