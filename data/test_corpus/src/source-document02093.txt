At Chihuahua & Small Dog Rescue, Inc., we are dedicated to finding the best possible home for each Chihuahua and small dog we have in our care. Also, we are committed to good health and quality of life for each and every little one that we rescue. All of our little furry friends are placed in healthy, safe and loving foster homes and, therefore, are not housed in a shelter situation.  
Our Rescue's mission does not end with just placing dogs in new homes. We work hard to educate the public on how to meet the needs of small dogs and how to avoid abusive and neglectful situations with these little pets.  
Chihuahua & Small Dog Rescue, Inc. is an all volunteer organization. No one is paid for their wonderful dedication to the homeless, abused and neglected Chihuahuas and small dogs that come into our organization. We will not turn away a dog because it is injured, ill or elderly. Our seniors and special needs dogs will make a wonderful addition to your family, so please also consider the adoption of one of our extra-special little ones.  
When we receive a little one, he/she will receive all medical care that is needed. Prior to adoption, our little ones are spay/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, fecal tested and have had all their veterinary needs met. If necessary, prior to adoption, we provide treatment for heartworms, luxating patellas, dental work, parvo, etc. The dogs you see, on our website, are living in our homes as loved members of our families. They beg at the table at meals, sleep in our beds, snuggle in our laps while we watch TV, go for rides in the car, chase the mop, and happily celebrate our return home, even after just taking out the garbage!!! We are not a shelter. We keep the foster dogs in our homes and give them lots of TLC. During this time, we evaluate the dog's temperament, socialization and health. We want the best possible match for the dog and the adopting human. 
Forgive us if we seem to be intrusive when you apply to adopt a dog. We are extremely picky in choosing homes for our little ones. Once they become foster members of our family, we treat them as we do our own pets. We want our foster dogs to go to the home that best suits them. Although we don always have a history on the dog past or know how it got to the shelter, we do have a sense of its character and needs. If you see a little one that you'd like to adopt, please fill out an adoption application. We get quite a few applications, so please be patient with us as we are all volunteers and work full time jobs, as we do get back to each and every person. 
If we feel that you would be a good match for one of our little ones, we will phone or email you and make an appointment for a home visit. We, generally, do not adopt our little ones to families with children under the age of 6.
