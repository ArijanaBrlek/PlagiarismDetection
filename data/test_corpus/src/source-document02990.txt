This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been compiled from questions asked of the SPC as well as basic tornado research information and countless scientific resources. More material will be added, time permitting. If you find a link not working or an error of any sort, please . e-mail the FAQ author
Tornado FAQ is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to tornadoes. Instead, it is a quick-reference summary of tornado knowledge, which will link you to more detailed information if you desire. Recent books from your local library or a major university library are still the deepest resource for learning about tornadoes and other severe storms; so if you are doing your own research or school reports, please visit the library in person. There are many good websites with tornado information also. Some of them are linked from the answers below. None of the links to outside websites implies any kind of commercial endorsement on the part of the SPC. The intent here is to direct you to the best tornado info available. There is also a partial related to tornadoes for those with some meteorological education and training. The list of technical scientific references

THE BASICS ABOUT TORNADOES
What is a tornado?to the (AMS 2000), a tornado is Literally, in order for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground the cloud base. Weather scientists haven't found it so simple in practice, however, to classify and define tornadoes. For example, the difference is unclear between an strong mesocyclone (parent thunderstorm circulation) on the ground, and a large, weak tornado. There is also disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. It is well-known that a tornado may . Also, at what wind speed of the cloud-to-ground vortex does a tornado begin? How close must two or more different tornadic circulations become to qualify as a one , instead of separate tornadoes? There are no firm answers. According Glossary of Meteorology"a violently rotating column of air, pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud."and not have a visible funnel multiple-vortex tornado

do tornadoes form? How The classic answer -- "warm moist Gulf air meets cold Canadian air and dry air from the Rockies" -- is a gross oversimplification. Many thunderstorms form under those conditions (near warm fronts, cold fronts and drylines respectively), which never even come close to producing tornadoes. when the large-scale environment is extremely favorable for tornadic thunderstorms, as in an SPC "High Risk" outlook, not every thunderstorm spawns a tornado. The truth is that we don't fully understand. destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from -- which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a . also produce , severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent , and .] Tornado formation is believed to be dictated mainly by things which happen , in and around the mesocyclone. Recent theories and results from the program suggest that once a mesocyclone is underway, tornado development is related to the temperature differences across the edge of downdraft air wrapping around the mesocyclone (the ). Mathematical modeling studies of tornado formation also indicate that it can happen without such temperature patterns; and in fact, very little temperature variation was observed near some of the most destructive tornadoes in history on . The details behind these theories are given in several of the accompanying this FAQ.

do tornadoes come from? Does the region of the US play a role in path direction? What direction Tornadoes can appear from any direction. Most move from southwest to northeast, or west to east. Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked. [A tornado can double back suddenly, for example, when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core.] Some areas of the US to have more paths from a specific direction, such as northwest in Minnesota or southeast in coastal south Texas. This is because of an increased frequency of certain tornado-producing weather patterns (say, hurricanes in south Texas, or northwest-flow weather systems in the upper Midwest).tend

hail always come before the tornado? Rain? ? Utter silence? Does Lightning Not necessarily, for any of those. Rain, wind, , and characteristics vary from storm to storm, from one hour to the next, and even with the direction the storm is moving with respect to the observer. While large hail indicate the presence of an unusually dangerous thunderstorm, and happen before a tornado, don't depend on it. Hail, or any particular pattern of rain, lightning or calmness, is not a reliable predictor of tornado threat. lightning hail cancan

do tornadoes dissipate? How The details are still debated by tornado scientists. We do know tornadoes need a source of instability (heat, moisture, etc.) and a larger-scale property of rotation () to keep going. There are a lot of processes around a thunderstorm which can possibly rob the area around a tornado of either instability or vorticity. One is relatively cold -- the flow of wind out of the precipitation area of a shower or thunderstorm. Many tornadoes have been observed to go away soon after being hit by outflow. For decades, storm observers have documented the death of numerous tornadoes when their parent circulations (vorticity outflow mesocyclones) weaken after they become wrapped in outflow air -- either from the same thunderstorm or a different one. The irony is that some kinds of thunderstorm outflow may help to cause tornadoes, while other forms of outflow may kill tornadoes. BACK UP TO THE TOP
Do tornadoes really skip? Not in a literal sense, despite what you may have read in many older references, news stories, or even damage survey reports. By definition (above), a tornado must be in contact with the ground. There is disagreement in meteorology over whether or not multiple touchdowns of the same vortex or mean different tornadoes (a strict interpretation). In either event, stories of skipping tornadoes usually mean funnel cloud
There was continuous contact between vortex and ground in the path, but it was too weak to do damage;
Multiple tornadoes happened; but there was no survey done to precisely separate their paths (very common before the 1970s); or
There were multiple tornadoes with only short separation, but the survey erroneously classified them as one tornado.

How long does a tornado last?Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour. The longest-lived tornado in history is really unknown, because so many of the long-lived tornadoes reported from the early-mid 1900s and before are believed to be tornado series instead. Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes.

How close to a tornado does the barometer drop? And how far does it drop ? It varies. A barometer can start dropping many hours or even days in advance of a tornado if there is low pressure on a broad scale moving into the area. Strong pressure falls will often happen as the mesocyclone (parent circulation in the thunderstorm) moves overhead or nearby. The biggest drop will be in the tornado itself, of course. It is very hard to measure pressure in tornadoes since most weather instruments can't survive. A few low-lying, armored probes called "" have been placed successfully in tornadoes. This includes one deployment on 15 May 2003 by engineer/storm chaser Tim Samaras, who recorded pressure fall of over 40 millibars through an unusually large tornado. On 24 June 2003, another of Tim's probes recorded a pressure plunge in a violent tornado near Manchester, SD (). Despite those spectacular results, and a few fortuitous passes over barometers through history, we still do not have a database of tornado pressures big enough to say much about average tornado pressures or other barometric characteristics. turtles 100 millibar National Geographic report

What is a waterspout? A waterspout is a -- usually meaning non-supercell tornadoes over water. Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast -- especially off southern Florida and the Keys -- and can happen over seas, bays and lakes worldwide. Although waterspouts are always tornadoes by definition; they don't officially count in tornado records unless they hit land. They are smaller and weaker than the most intense Great Plains tornadoes, but still can be quite dangerous. Waterspouts can overturn small boats, damage ships, do significant damage when hitting land, and kill people. The will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts can move onshore. tornado over water National Weather Service

How are tornadoes in the northern hemisphere different from tornadoes in the southern hemisphere?The sense of rotation is usually the opposite. Most tornadoes -- but not all! -- rotate , which is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise south of the equator. (clockwise-spinning in the northern hemisphere) have been observed, however -- usually in the form of waterspouts, non-supercell land tornadoes, or anticyclonic whirls around the rim of a supercell's mesocyclone. There have been several documented cases of cyclonic and anticyclonic tornadoes under the same thunderstorm at the same time. Anticyclonically rotating supercells with tornadoes are extremely rare; but , in 1998.

is a multivortex What tornado ? Multivortex (a.k.a. multiple-vortex) tornadoes contain two or more small, intense orbiting the center of the larger tornado circulation. When a tornado doesn't contain too much dust and debris, . These vortices may form and die within a few seconds, sometimes appearing to train through the same part of the tornado one after another. They can happen in all sorts of tornado sizes, from huge "" tornadoes to narrow "" tornadoes. Subvortices are the cause of most of the narrow, short, extreme swaths of damage that sometimes arc through tornado tracks. From the air, they can preferentially mow down crops and stack the stubble, leaving . Multivortex tornadoes are the source of most of the old stories from newspapers and other media before the late 20th century which told of several tornadoes seen together at once. subvortices they can sometimes be spectacularly visible wedge rope cycloidal marks in fields

What is the original F-scale? Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed a damage scale (Fujita 1971, Fujita and Pearson 1973) for winds, including tornadoes, which was supposed to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of the wind. The original F-scale should not be used anymore, because it has been replaced by. Tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown; and . Different winds may be needed to cause the same damage depending on how well-built a structure is, wind direction, wind duration, battering by flying debris, and a bunch of other factors. Also, the process of rating the damage itself is largely a judgment call -- quite inconsistent and arbitrary (Doswell and Burgess, 1988). Even meteorologists and engineers highly experienced in damage survey techniques often came up with different F-scale ratings for the same damage. Even with all its flaws, the original F-scale was the only widely used tornado rating method for over three decades. The takes effect 1 February 2007. This scale was the result. an enhanced version the wind speeds on the original F-scale have never been scientifically tested and proven enhanced F-scale

What is the Enhanced F-scale? The Enhanced F-scale ( or detailed ) is a much more precise and robust way to assess tornado damage than the . It classifies F0-F5 damage as calibrated by engineers and meteorologists across 28 different types of damage indicators (mainly various kinds of buildings, but also a few other structures as well as trees). The idea is that a "one size fits all" approach just doesn't work in rating tornado damage, and that a tornado scale needs to take into account the typical strengths and weaknesses of different types of construction. This is because the same wind does different things to different kinds of structures. In the Enhanced F-scale, there will be different, customized standards for assigning any given F rating to a well built, well anchored wood-frame house compared to a garage, school, skyscraper, unanchored house, barn, factory, utility pole or other type of structure. In a real-life tornado track, these ratings can be mapped together more smoothly to make a damage analysis. Of course, there still will be gaps and weaknesses on a track where there was little or nothing to damage, but such problems will be less common than under the . As with the original F-scale, the enhanced version will rate the tornado as a whole based on most intense damage within the path. . simple table 95 page PDF original original F-scale There are no plans to systematically re-evaluate historical tornadoes using the Enhanced F-scale.

So if the original F-scale winds are just guesses, why are they so specific?Excellent question. Those winds were arbitrarily attached to the damage scale based on 12-step mathematical interpolation between the hurricane criteria of the , and the threshold for Mach 1 (738 mph). Though the F-scale actually peaks at F12 (Mach 1), only F1 through F5 are used in practice, with F0 attached for tornadoes of winds weaker than hurricane force. Again, F-scale wind-to-damage relationships are untested, unknown and purely hypothetical. They have never been proven and may not represent real tornadoes. F-scale winds should not be taken literally. Beaufort wind scale

I heard the Oklahoma City tornado was almost "F6." Is that a real level on the original F-scale?Only in untested theory. Fujita plotted hypothetical winds higher than F5; but as mentioned in the previous answer above, they were only guesses. Even if the winds measured by portable Doppler radar (32 meters above ground level, roughly 302 mph) had been over 318 mph, the tornado would still be rated "only" F5 since F5 is the .

What is a "significant" tornado? A tornado is classified as "significant" if it does F2 or greater damage on the . Grazulis (1993) also included killer tornadoes of any damage scale in his significant tornado database. It is important to know that those definitions are arbitrary, for scientific research. No tornado is necessarily significant. Any tornado can kill or cause damage; and some tornadoes rated less than F2 probably could do F2 or greater damage if they hit a well-built house during peak intensity. Enhanced F scale in

Big fat tornadoes are the strongest ones, right?Not necessarily. There is a statistical trend (as by NSSL's Harold Brooks) toward wide tornadoes having higher damage. This can be out of more strength or out of greater opportunity for targets to damage -- or some blend of both. However, the size or shape of does not say anything conclusive about its strength.

we weaken or destroy tornadoes somehow, like by bombing them or sucking out their heat with a bunch of dry ice? Can't The main problem with anything which could realistically stand a chance at affecting a tornado (e.g., hydrogen bomb) is that it would be even more deadly and destructive than the tornado itself. Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry) would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the tornado much anyway. Imagine the legal problems one would face, too, by trying to bomb or ice a tornado, then inadvertently hurting someone or destroying private property in the process. In short -- bad idea!

How does cloud seeding affect tornadoes? Nobody knows, for certain. There is no proof that seeding can or cannot change tornado potential in a thunderstorm. This is because there is no way to know that the things a thunderstorm does after seeding would not have happened . This includes any presence or lack of rain, hail, wind gusts or tornadoes. Because the effects of seeding are impossible to prove or disprove, there is a great deal of controversy in meteorology about whether it works, and if so, under what conditions, and to what extent.anyway

What does a tornado sound like? That depends on what it is hitting, its size, intensity, closeness and other factors. The most common tornado sound is a continuous rumble, like a closeby train. Sometimes a tornado produces a loud whooshing sound, like that of a waterfall or of open car windows while driving very fast. Tornadoes which are tearing through densely populated areas may be producing all kinds of loud noises at once, which collectively may make a tremendous roar. . Any intense thunderstorm wind can produce damage and cause a roar.Just because you may have heard a loud roar during a damaging storm does not necessarily mean it was a tornado

Do hurricanes and tropical storms produce tornadoes? Often, but not always. There are great differences from storm to storm, not related to tropical cyclone size or intensity. Some landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. fail to produce any known tornadoes, while others cause major outbreaks. The same hurricane also may have none for awhile, then erupt with tornadoes...or vice versa! Andrew (1992), for example, spawned several tornadoes across the Deep South after crossing the Gulf, but produced none during its rampage across South Florida. Katrina (2005) spawned numerous tornadoes after its devastating LA/MS landfall, but only one in Florida (in the Keys). Though fewer tornadoes tend to occur with tropical depressions and tropical storms than hurricanes, there are notable exceptions like TS Beryl of 1994 in the Carolinas. Some tropical cyclones even produce two distinct sets of tornadoes -- one around the time of landfall over Florida or the Gulf Coast, the other when well inland or exiting the Atlantic coast.necessarily

What's the nature of tornadoes in hurricanes and tropical storms? tend to occur in small, low-topped supercells within the outer bands, NNW through ESE of the center -- mainly the northeast quadrant. There, the orientation and speed of the winds create vertical shear profiles somewhat resembling those around -- the shear being in a shallower layer but often stronger. Occasionally a tornado will happen in the inner bands as well, but the large majority still form the hurricane force wind zone. Because tornado-producing circulations in hurricane supercells tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their Midwest counterparts, they are harder to detect on , and more difficult to warn for. But hurricane-spawned tornadoes can still be quite deadly and destructive, as shown by the F3 tornado from Hurricane Andrew at La Place LA (1992, 2 killed) and an F4 tornado at Galveston TX from Hurricane Carla (1961, 8 killed).

? Do tropical cyclones produce waterspouts Yes. Waterspouts -- tornadoes over water -- have been observed in tropical systems. We don't know how many of them happen in tropical cyclones, but a majority probably are from supercells. The similarity in velocity signatures over water to tornado-producing cells in landfalling hurricanes suggests that it may be common -- and yet another good reason for ships to steer well clear of tropical cyclones.

Does tropical cyclone strength or size matter for tornadoes? Often, but not always. Relatively weak hurricanes like Danny (1985) have spawned significant supercell tornadoes well inland, as have larger, more intense storms like Beulah (1967) and Ivan (2004). In general, the bigger and stronger the wind fields are with a tropical cyclone, the bigger the area of favorable wind shear for supercells and tornadoes. But supercell tornadoes (whether or not in tropical cyclones) also depend on instability, lift and moisture. Surface moisture isn't lacking in a tropical cyclone, but sometimes instability and lift are too weak. This is why tropical systems tend to produce more tornadoes in the daytime and near any fronts that may get involved in the cyclone circulation. It is also why SPC won't have tornado watches out for every instance of a tropical cyclone affecting land. For more details, there is a set of articles on tropical cyclone tornadoes listed in the section.
