Home > Public Education >WV National Fire Incident Reporting System
The Public Education Division is responsible for administration of the states fire and non-fire incident reporting system. On a daily basis, the division actively supports and promotes the use of computer-based reporting in an NFIRS-compatible format by all West Virginias fire departments in an effort to standardize and expedite incident reporting for the state. This enables both the Fire Marshals Office and fire departments to accessand effectively use--statistics that better reflect specific fire and life-safety trends and needs in West Virginia. By the end of FY 2006, approximately 55% of WV fire departments were reporting on-line directly to the USFA national database; 15% more were using purchased computer programs for fire data entry; and 30% were still reporting on paper. As of June 31, 2007, all active West Virginia fire departments were reporting via computer-based systems (both purchased software and the free Federal Client Tool). The division also enforces the codes requiring mandatory incident reporting by all fire departments, oversees eligibility for quarterly funding for part-paid and volunteer departments and prepares quarterly eligibility lists for the State Treasurer.

Quarterly Funding Requirements forVolunteer and Part-Paid Fire Departments
On a quarterly basis, the SFMO Public Education Division is responsible for submitting to the State Treasurer a list of all volunteer and part-paid fire departments eligible to receive a portion of funding allocated from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the Fire Protection Fund.
This list includes volunteer and part-paid departments that have met all eligibility requirements as cited in WV Code sections indicated below for the quarter in question:
WVC 8-15-8a Eligibility for allocation from municipal pensions and protection fund and the fire protection fund
WVC 87-1-2 Reporting of Fire Incidences
Fire departments that fail to submit incident reports in a timely manner will have their name removed from the list that is sent to the State Treasurer, resulting in their department losing the funding from that quarter. .These monies are not retrievable
In other words, once the department has been removed from the quarters eligibility list, the monies cannot be restored to the fire department for that quarter. Instead, the lost funding for that department is reallocated among fire departments that are on the eligibility list for the quarter.
Fire departments are consistently notified via e-mail, phone, and certified mail well in advance of the quarterly deadlines. If a department is experiencing problems (technical, personnel, etc.), they should contact the Public Education Division as soon as possible in order to get assistance in complying with reporting deadlines and to avoid losing their funding for the quarter.
