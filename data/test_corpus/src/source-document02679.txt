In people at high risk for lung cancer, low-dose CT scanning of the chest may detect early lung cancer. However, "its usefulness as a screening tool is limited because it misses tumors in certain areas of the lung and often falsely identifies harmless spots as being cancerous.      Workers exposed to the pesticide chlorpyrifos have an elevated risk of lung cancer and . Annual screening for lung cancer using computed tomography (CT) can help detect the disease at its earliest, most curable stage, but it does not reduce mortality from the disease and could actually result in more harm than good.      Plenty of sunshine and vitamin D may help people with early stage lung cancer survive longer after surgery. Patients who had high levels of vitamin D and had lung cancer surgery in sunny months were more than twice as likely to be alive five years after surgery compared to patients with low levels of vitamin D who had surgery in the winter. Exposure to sunshine is a significant source of vitamin D, which also comes from food and dietary supplements.      A study conducted in an area of Italy where residential radon levels are high confirms that the risk of lung cancer increases in step with levels of radon exposure, but that the Mediterranean diet may modify the effects. In the study, researchers examined the association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer in 384 "case" patients with lung cancer and 404 control patients without lung cancer. They considered the potential role of smoking, diet, and other risk factors. The researchers determined residential history during the 30-year period ending 5 years prior to enrollment. Radon detectors were placed in the main bedroom and the living room in each residence for two consecutive 6-month periods. Confirming prior studies, the researchers found a positive link between indoor radon and lung cancer. The odds of developing lung cancer rose with increasing levels of residential radon exposure. Overall, the increase was generally not statistically significant, although significance was reached for some high radon exposure categories. They also report that individuals with low-medium consumption of dietary oxidants tended to be at greater risk for developing lung cancer. The possibility that dietary antioxidants may modify the effects of radon on lung cancer risk should be studied further, they conclude. SOURCE: International Journal of Cancer, May 10, 2005.      Although both marijuana and tobacco smoke are packed with cancer-causing chemicals, other qualities of marijuana seem to keep it from promoting lung cancer. The difference rests in the often opposing actions of the nicotine in tobacco and the active ingredient, THC, in marijuana, says Dr. Robert Melamede of the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. Whereas nicotine has several effects that promote lung and other types of cancer, THC acts in ways that counter the cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke. Lab research indicates that nicotine activates a body enzyme that converts certain chemicals in both tobacco and marijuana smoke into cancer-promoting form. In contrast, studies in mice suggest that THC blocks this enzyme activity.      Eating cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli and sprouts, protects against the development of lung cancer. A person's genetic makeup may influence these anti-cancer benefits.      Daily on-the-job exposure to the pesticide diazinon appears to increase the risk of lung cancer and possibly other cancers, according to new findings from the US government-sponsored Agricultural Health Study, a project begun in 1993 to investigate the health effects of pesticides on farm families in Iowa and North Carolina.Lung Cancer

is an interesting nutrient that has been looked at as a treatment for . Many healthy people who smoke or drink may have a genetic alteration in the cells of the mouth and throat that could signal an increased risk of developing cancer.      A simple inspection of the mouth by trained healthcare workers could reduce oral cancer deaths worldwide by at least 37,000 annually. Oral cancer is a common problem among men in developing countries, and is often associated with tobacco or alcohol use. Short of convincing people not to engage in these activities -- which is notoriously difficult -- detecting and treating early disease may be the best approach. Visual inspection of the mouth has proven to be a simple and accurate means of screening for oral cancer.Neuroblastoma

After following more than 60,000 women for an average of 13.5 years, Swedish researchers found that those who drank at least two glasses of milk every day or consumed at least four daily servings of dairy products were twice as likely to develop serous epithelial as those who consumed less than two servings of dairy a day.    Increased risk with postmenopausal estrogen use. Decreased risk with aspirin use. Women who eat plenty of begetables, particluarly carrots, tomatoes and other foods high in carotene and lycopene may reduce their risk.    Cancer Ovarian Cancer
A case-control study of diet and the risk of ovarian cancer.Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Sep;13(9):1521-7. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that some dietary factors may play a role in the etiology of ovarian cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. We assessed the association of ovarian cancer with dietary factors in a population-based case-control study in Canada. Diet information was collected on 442 incident cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in 1994 to 1997 and 2,135 population controls via a self-administered questionnaire. We did not observe an association of ovarian cancer risk with dietary fat intake, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein, carbohydrate, dietary fiber, fruit, dairy products, meat products, fish, chicken, grain products, nut products, baked desserts, margarine, butter, mayonnaise, and supplement of multiple vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, zinc, and selenium. Our findings suggested that ovarian cancer risk was positively associated with higher consumption of dietary cholesterol and eggs and inversely associated with higher intake of total vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and supplementation of vitamin E, beta-carotene, and B-complex vitamins.

Eating a lot of hot dogs, salami, bacon, smoked ham, or other processed meat products may raise the risk of stomach cancer. Besides salt and nitrites or nitrates, processed meats often contain cancer-causing nitrosamines, which may be responsible for the link. Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes increase the risk of stomach cancer.Stomach Cancer
Testicular Cancer Q. I am a 43 year old male who recently underwent an inguinal orchiectomy - 10 days ago. I noticed I was having some ''hot flashes'' last week while I was recovering, and informed my Urologist about these symptoms. He had blood drawn from me (not in the morning as suggested), the findings indicated I had an abnormally low testosterone count of 26 nanograms per deciliter. To back up somewhat, I had been taking about 250 mg of DHEA per day for well over a year and only discontinued it's use about 5 days prior to my diagnosis of testicular cancer. So, as of today I have been off DHEA for approximately 2 weeks. Now my Doctor has me on a topical gel to replace testosterone and has basically told me I am stuck with this for life. I have one testicle, but it appears to not be functioning.    A. This is interesting, I do not know if taking the extremely high dosages of DHEA had an influence on the testicular cancer formation.

The use of clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation in women with fertility problems appears to be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer.
A cancer is a cell that has lost its normal control mechanisms and thus has unregulated growth. Cancer can develop from any tissue within any organ. As cancer cells grow and multiply, they form a mass of cancerous tissue that invades adjacent tissues and can spread (metastasize) around the bodyWhat is a Cancer?
Cancer cells develop from normal cells in a complex process called transformation. The first step in the process is initiation, in which a change in the cell's genetic material primes the cell to become cancerous. The change in the cell's genetic material is brought about by an agent called a carcinogen--such as a chemical, virus, radiation, or sunlight. However, not all cells are equally susceptible to carcinogens. A genetic flaw in the cell or another agent, called a promoter, may make it more susceptible. Even chronic physical irritation may make cells more susceptible to becoming cancerous. In the next step, promotion, a cell that has been initiated becomes cancerous. Several factors, often the combination of a susceptible cell and a carcinogen, are needed to cause cancer. About 15 to 20 percent of cancers are associated with an infection, for instance viruses with cervical cancer and helicobacter pylori with gastric cancer.

Nuclear industry workers exposed to chronic low doses of radiation have a slightly higher risk of developing cancer. Approximately one person out of 1,000 would develop cancer from exposure to the amount of radiation from a single, average whole body CT-scan. Even very low doses of radiation pose a risk of cancer over a person lifetime, including radiation from routine X-rays.Cancer and Radiation exposure
Death rates, both overall and cancer -related, are considerably higher among workers engaged in manufacturing computers and component parts, when compared with the general population. Similar findings have been reported among employees who work in plants that manufacture computers, semiconductors, integrated circuits and other componentsCancer due to Work exposure of toxins
Diesel fumes from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the busiest U.S. seaport complex -- raise the risk of cancer for people living up to 15 miles inland. The report by the California Air Resources Board said 50,000 people living closest to the two ports face a higher-than-average risk of developing cancer from port pollution alone. But even residents living within 15 miles of the complex face a slightly higher risk than Californians as a wholeCancer and Pollution
Cancer Research Update
In findings that could make broccoli and Brussels sprouts easier to swallow, early research suggests a chemical found in the vegetables may impede the spread of breast cancer cells. Scientists found that the compound, called sulforaphane, hindered the growth of human breast cancer cells in the lab. It did so by apparently disrupting the action of protein 'microtubules' within the cells, which are vital for the success of cell division. The findings are published in the Journal of Nutrition. Past research has suggested a role for sulforaphane in preventing cancer, possibly due to its effects on detoxification enzymes that can defend against cancer-promoting substances. A study in rats showed that oral sulforaphane blocked the formation of breast tumors, and scientists have found that the chemical can push colon cancer cells to commit suicide. This latest research suggests a new mechanism -- microtubule disruption -- by which sulforaphane may bestow anti-cancer benefits.
People who were exposed to asbestos through a family member who worked with the material appear to run the risk of developing the asbestos-related cancer mesothelioma many years later.
Treatment with a shark cartilage product does not prolong life in patients with advanced cancer, nor does it improve quality of life. Shark cartilage has become a popular alternative medicine for people with advanced cancer. Its use is based on the belief that the reason sharks rarely develop cancer is because of their high cartilage content. Previous reports examining the benefits of shark cartilage as an anti-cancer therapy, however, have yielded mixed results. In one of the few randomized trials to evaluate this treatment, Dr. Charles L. Loprinzi, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and colleagues compared the outcomes of 89 patients with incurable breast or colon cancer who were treated with shark cartilage or placebo in addition to standard care and treatment with chemotherapy if appropriate. The shark cartilage and placebo were supplied as a powder, mixed with water or juice, and consumed three to four times per day. There was no difference in overall survival between subjects drinking shark cartilage and those drinking placebo, the researchers report in the journal Cancer.
High blood levels of iron coupled with high levels of very low density (VLDL) lipoprotein cholesterol appear to interact to increase the risk of cancer. Iron and lipids combine to create oxidative stress, and oxidative stress has a role in the development of cancer.
Growing body of evidence linking increased night light to certain types of cancer has led researchers to suspect it could be connected to the steady increase in cases of childhood leukemia. Scientists presenting research at the First International Scientific Conference on Childhood Leukemia said that light at night and working shifts, which disrupts the body's internal clock, have been associated with an raised risk of breast and colorectal cancer.
People who get whole-body X-ray scans in the hope of finding tumors at their earliest stages may, ironically, be raising their overall risk of cancer. The scans are marketed as a way to catch cancer before symptoms begin, but the radiation from the scans themselves could cause cancer.
Loss of weight and muscle mass, common among people with cancer, may be improved with fish oil supplements, according to a new report. Intestinal upsets make high-dose fish oil capsules difficult for many people with cancer-related wasting to tolerate, but those who are able to take the supplements regularly may be able to stabilize their weight or even gain pounds, according to Dr. Patrick Burns of the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City and colleagues. Animal studies and some clinical investigations have suggested omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils may protect against cachexia, as weight loss related to a chronic disease is called.
The intake of 400-600 g/d of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced incidence of many common forms of cancer, and diets rich in plant foods are also associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and many chronic diseases of ageing. These foods contain phytochemicals that have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties which confer many health benefits. Many phytochemicals are colourful, and recommending a wide array of colourful fruits and vegetables is an easy way to communicate increased diversity of intake to the consumer. For example, red foods contain lycopene, the pigment in tomatoes, which is localized in the prostate gland and may be involved in maintaining prostate health, and which has also been linked with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Green foods, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts and kale, contain glucosinolates which have also been associated with a decreased risk of cancer. Garlic and other white-green foods in the onion family contain allyl sulphides which may inhibit cancer cell growth. Other bioactive substances in green tea and soybeans have health benefits as well.
Two-thirds of children who survive cancer go on to face higher risks of another cancer, heart disease, or other health problems as they grow up.
The Unending Debate: Do Vitamin Pills Prevent Cancer?For several decades the scientific community has debated whether vitamin and mineral supplements prevent or reduce the risk of cancer. Over the years numerous studies have given contradictory results leaving the medical community uncertain of what to recommend to the public. In this latest study, scientists, from the Scientific and Technical Institute for Nutrition and Diet in Paris, France gave a vitamin/mineral supplement to thousands of men and women. A total of 13,000 men and women aged 35 to 60 took part in the study. Half were given a daily supplement containing 6mg of beta-carotene, 120mg of vitamin C, 90mg of vitamin E, 100 micrograms of selenium, and 20 milligrams of zinc. A dummy capsule was given to the other participants. At the end of seven years, the researchers found that taking the supplement had no effect on heart disease, and did not influence cancer rates in women. But they found a 31% reduction in the risk of all cancers in men taking the antioxidants. And, overall, the death rate was 37% lower among men who took the supplement. The researchers, said: "Our findings support recommendations for following a healthy diet, particularly one rich in fruit and vegetables which are major dietary sources of antioxidant vitamins and minerals, for all ages in life and for both sexes." They added that women may not have received the same benefits because their diet were better than those of men and they perhaps were already ingesting many healthy antioxidants through their diet.      Dr. Sahelian says: The debate seems to continue regarding the role of vitamin/mineral supplements and the prevention of cancer. It appears that those with a very health diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables are not likely to reap much benefit from supplements, but those with a marginal diet would.
A number of genetic and environmental factors increases the risk of developing cancer. Family history is one important factor. Some families have a significantly higher risk of developing certain cancers than other families. For example, a woman's risk of developing breast cancer increases up to 3 times if her mother or sister had breast cancer. Some breast cancers are linked to a specific gene mutation, more common in some ethnic groups and families.    A number of environmental factors increase the risk of cancer. One of the most important is cigarette smoking. Smoking cigarettes substantially increases the risk of developing cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder.    The destruction of the body's natural rhythms accelerated the growth of cancerous tumors in laboratory animals.What are the risk factors for Cancer?
