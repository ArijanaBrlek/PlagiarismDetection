For casual computer users, a new keyboard is a frivolous luxury; the one that came with your PC works fine, right? But you and I know that a good keyboard can boost your productivity, save your wrists from repetitive-stress injuries, and add a little style to your desktop. No matter which of these are important to you, we’ve reviewed a keyboard that’s a perfect match.
Some are designed solely for comfortable typing and mousing, like Microsoft ’s Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000, with its split-keyboard design and bulky mouse. I use this keyboard and mouse in the office, and it’s completely eliminated the type of wrist ache that so many power-users suffer from.
Some manage to get by on their looks, like Saitek ’s colorful USB Multimedia Keyboard, available in eye-popping colors like neon pink or blue. Apple ’s new keyboard falls into this category as well; it isn’t particularly comfortable or packed with features (not even a keypad on the Bluetooth version), but its profile is stunning.
Other keyboards are designed for specific tasks, like multimedia use or gaming. Microsoft’s Wireless Entertainment Desktop 8000 has the looks, backlit keys, and multimedia controls necessary to complement a Media Center PC in your living room. The Merc Stealth also has backlit keys, but it’s for gaming in dark rooms, and the keyboard includes a ton of gamer-specific controls for your left hand so your right hand can stay on your mouse or joystick.
