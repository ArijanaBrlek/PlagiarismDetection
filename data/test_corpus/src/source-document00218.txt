by Mateen. Siddiqui.
If dieting is your best idea to lose weight then you are in for a surprise. In this article I will show you how dieting works, how it fails and how to use food to lose weight.
Dieting and what it means
The very word "Dieting" implies severe restriction of calories. When people say that they are "on a diet" or "dieting", they simply mean that they would love to eat that chocolate pie or ice-cream but they cannot, at least for a few days since they are dieting.
I am sure the word dieting originated with good intention but it is often misused and sometimes abused to lure you in to the latest fad diet or exercise program.
The Science of Dieting
The very reason you are fat is because you are eating too many calories. So is the common belief. But the real fact is the obesity is multifactorial. Improper eating habits { so easy to be indulged in today's world}, combined with sedentary lifestyle are two significant factors.
Dieting does work. At least in the short term. But increasing data from follow up studies and then later experimental ones does prove that you are more than likely to get the lost weight back and some more. This is called Rebound Weight Gain.
The flaw in dieting
After a short term effect you will see that you are gaining back the weight you lost. This is due to the backfire effect where your body when it goes in to the starvation mode and reacts by storing all the calories it can.
When you diet you send the body same signal our ancestors sent when they lived in caves. The signal simply says, "".Store today and use tomorrow
Second reason for rebound weight gain is your frustrated response. Once you starve yourself of everything you like you are likely to binge and waste all your efforts.
You see your body is the most amazing piece of machinery there is. Unlike other machines, it adapts, increasing its efficiency with use. Use your body to exert, it simply expends calories and starve yourself, it stores all the food it can.
Other effects
Dieting has also shown to lower your metabolism.
Dieting loses muscle mass as the muscle will be used for energy purposes.
I am sure you see the reasoning.
How to make food work for you
In simple words dieting is like winning a lottery, a small one though. You may be happy but you will lose all you money soon and get back to square one. To see the real weight loss results and to get a slim trim body you need a mental shift in your food choices.
Fortunately the foods that make you fat are the same ones which will cause heart issues, diabetes and obesity related problems in the long run. Another reason to avoid high fat foods and processed sugars.
Firstly stop dieting and start making smart choices. is a great place to start. But you need to do more. In part two we will talk about foods you can eat all you can but when you need them. I am getting ahead of myself. Delicious low fat recipes
