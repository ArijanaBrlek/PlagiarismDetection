Disney Racer - Darth Vader (Star Wars)
The great outdoors, with its open fields and mountains adorned with massive pine trees and thick brush plays home to hundreds of animals and creatures of all shapes and sizes; this could only be known as Critter Country. For the most part, this vast wilderness is untouched by the hands of man; where he has come face-to-face with nature, the two live in harmony and every day is one of those Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah days. As evening comes, the cool night air is filled with the sounds of coyotes yipping at the moon and other critters searching for food - from soft mountain streams to the gnarled thorns of a huge briar patch. And there are bears in these parts as well - the kind once tracked by fearless explorers such as Davey Crockett in their canoes. It's where civilization as we know it meets Mother Nature head-on, and it's simply gorgeous!  Slow Moving Boat No   Thrill: .7   Theme: 1.0    Infant:   Child: 3.7  Pre-Teen: 3.9  Teen/Young Adult: 3.1  Adult: 3.2  Older Adult: 3.6    Water Thrill Ride Yes   Thrill: 1.3   Theme: 1.3    Infant:   Child: 3.9  Pre-Teen: 3.9  Teen/Young Adult: 3.9  Adult: 4.0  Older Adult: 4.0    Slow Moving Car Yes   Thrill: 2.0   Theme: 3.0    Infant:   Child: 3.5  Pre-Teen: 3.4  Teen/Young Adult: 3.0  Adult: 2.8  Older Adult: 3.4
