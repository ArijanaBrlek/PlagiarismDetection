 
Overview
Nielsen Outdoor electronically measures audiences of global outdoor advertising on billboards, kiosks, bus shelters, and the like. Now you can yield the critical reach, frequency and ratings information - complete with demographic breaks - that will put Outdoor advertising on a level playing field with other measured media. Outdoor advertising will be sold with the same confidence and metrics as TV, radio and print. Get quantifiable proof of the medium's value in reaching your consumers...when they see it, where they see it.
NPOD Technology and gps tracking
Nielsen Outdoor and its technology partner, RDP Associates, have developed a proprietary GPS device - the Nielsen Personal Outdoor Device, or Npod™ - about the size of a cell phone, which people carry in their pockets, purses or wear like a cell phone. Members of a randomly chosen sample carry an Npod™ as they move about on foot or in vehicles which is linked to orbiting satellites that enables Nielsen Outdoor to identify their location, speed and direction of travel, passively, continuously, easily and affordably.First Ever GPS-Based Outdoor Demographic Ratings In The World
To determine actual exposure estimates to outdoor displays, we gather travel information of the routes taken by an individual which are matched to a list of geo-coded outdoor sites to obtain passages, or the opportunity to see specific outdoor sites. When the respondent's travel path intersects with a known outdoor site, an "intercept" is recorded, with each event dated and time-stamped, and the direction and speed of travel noted. This provides a robust set of data with the "opportunity to see" an outdoor display. This unique technology also enables Nielsen Outdoor to accurately measure exposure to transit advertising, or opportunity to see the outside advertising on any bus.
From this information, comprehensive audience estimates can be calculated, including statistics like GRPs, reach and frequency, for day of week, time of day and across multiple days and weeks for different demographic groups.
One key benefit of the Nielsen Outdoor system is the breatkthrough use of advanced GPS technology and sophisticated computer processing which establishes travel patterns in “urban canyon” environments. Urban canyons are locations like those found between tall buildings, where a standard GPS unit cannot obtain a fix from three or more satellites and consequently cannot identify a person’s position The result: the first ever person-based GPS device that can accurately determine location.
