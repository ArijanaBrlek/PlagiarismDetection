Uranus's nine most prominent rings are seen in silhouette against the smooth globe of the planet in this Voyager 2 view from January 24, 1986, just 24 minutes before its closest approach. Epsilon is the darkest ring at right. Credit: NASA/JPL

Voyager 2 discovered that Uranus' brightest Epsilon ring is shepherded by two satellites, Cordelia (1986U7) and Ophelia (1986U8), each only about 40 kilometers in diameter. Credit: NASA/JPL

From 2001 to 2004, Uranus's motion around the Sun has changed its orientation as seen from Earth in these images taken through Keck II's K prime filter. The four images show how the Adaptive Optics system has improved over time. Color: Greyscale. Credit: Imke de Pater, Seran Gibbard, Heidi Hammel / W. M. Keck ObservatoryKeck's Changing View of Uranus
As Voyager 2 exited the Uranian system it looked back and caught the rings at a very high phase angle. The lighting makes lanes of fine dust visible that are not seen from any other point of view. The image is smeared because it is a 96-second exposure. Faint streaks are background stars.Credit: NASA/JPL

This pair of composite images from the Hubble Space Telescope shows newly discovered rings around Uranus. The outermost of the two rings (R/2003 U1) is thought to be replenished by dust tossed off of a newly discovered moon, named Mab, which shares an orbit with the ring. Mab is visible as a bright streak at the top of the outer ring. Credit: NASA, ESA, and M. Showalter (SETI Institute)
