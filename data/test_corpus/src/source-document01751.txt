Most critics consider this short to be a milestone in the evolution of Mickey Mouse. Although Fred Moore (long considered the "Mickey expert") tried to do something new with Mickey in every short, "The Pointer" is where it all came together into a more modern Mickey. The "acting" as well, especially in the scene showing the showdown with the bear, is considered to be Mickey's finest to date.
From : I am only 27 and still can't believe that I first saw this cartoon in a movie theatre, paired with 1938's . Unfortunately I did not recall the full-length feature I saw after that. But still, this is one of the finer hunting movies ever made, circulating around Pluto's frozen stature. The birds certainly loved playing basketball with Pluto's eyelids. Mickey is his classic self trying to divert the bear from ending his short 11 year career, but as usual they escape. No "beans" about it, this cartoon sure gets its "points" across.Tom Wilkins Ferdinand The Bull
From : The Pointer was a rather interesting cartoon for Mickey Mouse. Not because of the humor, but because of the realistic artwork. I'm totally unsure how Walt Disney, even as far back as the late 1930's and without modern computer technology was able to make his cartoons look so beautiful. A method like this was used in his first three animated features, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Pinocchio, and Fantasia. The Pointer also marked one of the earliest versions of the Mickey Mouse of today. Other than the artwork, the story was well presented, and both Mickey and Pluto learned a lot on their hunting adventure. With the United States' cultural aspects of today going down in flames, society could use more cartoons like these, especially from Disney.Brad Bethel
From : This short, aside from being a turning point of Mickey's appearance, has some high quality animation. As an artist myself, I just love how the forest has been painted. If I had been around when this short was produced, Disney could have hired me to paint the background scenes. I also noticed that the animals in this short looked like the ones that were in the movie "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."Ryan
From : The animation is very brilliant in this short. This is the first time Mickey has human eyes. "" was the last short to feature Mickey's dot eyes.Trae Robinson Society Dog Show
From : Yes this is definitely a turning point in Mickey's appearance. As Ryan mentioned the forest creatures look like the ones in "Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs". The Bear also looked like the one from "Good Scouts", "Little Hiawatha" and "Donald's Vacation"!Baruch Weiss
