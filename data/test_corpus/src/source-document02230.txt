SIR-C/X-SAR image Yellowstone Park, Wyoming
Two radar images of Yellowstone Park with an interesting description of what the images show, and how they were obtained.
Yellowstone Park and the surrounding areas of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho offer beautiful surroundings and it is no wonder that many people want to visit the area or even to relocate to it permanently. This 'human migration' raises a number of problems.
The building of housing in the valleys shrinks the available winter range for animals. Roads and fences interfere with animal migration. The introduction of 'foreign plants' disrupts the local flora, and noise and pollution from traffic drives rare animals further into the wilderness.
Besides these factors, the natural wealth of Yellowstone has proved a magnet for wealth-seekers over the years, from individual miners hoping to 'get rich' by panning gold in the rivers to giant multinational companies with plans to build giant waste dumps several miles from the Park boundary. Yellowstone's wealth is made of wood as well as gold, and battles have been fought to protect the region's trees for us all to enjoy.
Saving the beauty of Yellowstone will require a much care, along with knowledge and open-minded innovative solutions to preserve the sights, sounds and feel of the Yellowstone wilderness. Such caring must extend beyond borders of areas of designated wilderness because in reality there are no borders. Man-made global climate change, population size, loss of habitat and pollution are examples of the fingers of man's influence on the ecosystem. New priorities are necessary to preserve a desirable world. We can all help. As the great leader Ghandi once said: "What you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it".
