Arden, Delaware, has been a Single-Tax, Arts and Crafts, Garden-City Utopia since 1900.
The Village of Arden was founded in 1900 by sculptor Frank Stephens and architect Will Price, with financial help from Joseph Fels, the soap manufacturer. One of 17 land trusts founded between 1894 and 1950, Arden is based on the Single-Tax economic philosophy of Henry George. As a result, a person's house is not taxed, only the land it sits on. The land is owned in common and managed by three trustees. Inspired by the Garden-City Movement, half the land is woods and open space. Foot paths criss-cross the village. Arden is known for its artists and also for its theater. Stages abound, including two at the and one at the outdoor Field Theatre. In nearby Ardentown, you will find the .

Young Women Sliding in Cars
This time (10/25/2008) the young woman driving too fast in the rain was only 17. Her new car was only a week old. Harvey Road curved and she went straight, into a car coming the other way, breaking that driver's leg. Those first on the scene report he did not have his seat belt fastened. His air bags may have saved his life. Medical aid arrived 15 minutes after the 911 call went out and even then the man had to wait while the rescuers carefully tore off the back door and the center post of his car, put him in a neck brace and, after cutting his seat loose, removed him. Kudos go to the police and EMS personnel who displayed exemplary courtesy and professionalism.
An 18-year-old girl demolished her Saturn automobile on Friday, Sept. 12 about 10:30 p.m. after driving too fast to stay on the wet road. Minutes later, another accident occurred when a young man rear-ended a pickup truck driven by a fire department volunteer which had stopped suddenly to render aid. Thankfully, there were no injuries. Many people ignore the 25 MPH speed limit signs on Harvey Road, even on rainy nights, providing us with impromptu town meetings.
