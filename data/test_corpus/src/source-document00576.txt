Music: Overview
At Delaware Valley College, you don’t have to be a music major to be an active performer. Just ask the education major who performed the second movement of Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto at graduation, the biology major who plays first alto saxophone in the band, the ornamental horticulture major who performed under Moses Hogan at the Pennsylvania Collegiate Choral Festival or the agronomy major who starred in the chorale’s production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury.
At Delaware Valley College, we believe the performing arts play an important role in a student’s undergraduate education. That’s why we encourage all of our students to develop their creative skills by participating in one of our outstanding music organizations. At Delaware Valley College, you do not need to choose between music and chemistry lab. You can do both.
