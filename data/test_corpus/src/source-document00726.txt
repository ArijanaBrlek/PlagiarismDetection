Bloat - The topic of GDV (the canine bloat) is very real and frightening to any dog owner. Although most dog lovers out there are fairly educated about the subject, I feel that we all need a refresher course once in a while. Canine Bloat (Gastric Dilation or GDV) is a very dangerous disorder of the canine digestive system. Unfortunately the reasons behind this disorder seem to be somewhat puzzling and not so clear, but we have gathered some information about the disorder and the symptoms that may be helpful for all dog lovers. We also touch on the subject of getting the proper medical help in case of an emergency and you will also find a few suggestions that may or may not be helpful in preventing bloat. We do follow all the suggestions provided here since our German Shepherd Mundo has a very sensitive digestive system. Once again observation is the key element of course and we all must learn to read canine body language since they just cannot express themselves verbally.
