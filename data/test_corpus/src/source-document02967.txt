The human brain
One of the interactive displays at Maropeng showcases the development of the brain over millennia
The evolution of the modern human brain has allowed us to think, feel, plan and act the way we do
Implications of a more complex brain
The development of the brain enabled hominids to make and use tools and fire, communicate using language, develop culture and society, adapt to new environments and, finally, to become self-aware and creative.
This dramatic expansion in the size of the human brain had an immediate effect on the lifestyle and social structure of hominids. A combination of a growing brain case relative to a narrow pelvic outlet meant that mothers had to give birth to children earlier, and that newborn babies were thus relatively immature.
This meant that infants depended on parental care for increasingly prolonged periods. Due to its vulnerability during infancy, a young hominid would have had a far greater chance of survival if its mother and father remained in a monogamous relationship  a trait that was advanced through natural selection.
What large brains mean to us today
Our large brains have saved us from extinction. We have learned to shape our world to a large extent to suit ourselves and to adapt with ingenuity to situations beyond our control.
The evolution of the brain has enabled us to develop complex computer technology that can perform billions of calculations a second, build vehicles that can carry us all over the world and even beyond it, broadcast messages to millions of people simultaneously, develop medicines and health care that can prolong lives, and develop culture that enriches our lives daily. But our modern brains have also helped us to invent weapons of mass destruction &
Getting ahead
Changes in the size and organisation of the brain are thought to be important markers for the development of human-like behaviour. Most scientists believe that as our early hominid ancestors brains grew, so did their ability to make and use tools, develop language and think symbolically.
