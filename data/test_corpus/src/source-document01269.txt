About Julie
I am a Writer, Life Coach, Poet, Mother, Actor, Director and Lover of Life....... Recently I wrote this piece about what I delight in... and I think it really describes a big part of who I am... so I will put it here as well.  
I delight in early mornings, in surprises in the sunrise. I delight in deep eye contact, subtle smiles which hold secret connections. I delight in singing from the heart and soul.
I don’t delight in people who hurt my children with malicious, ill-thought words, brussel sprouts and music with bad language bursting from the car idling next to mine.
I delight in deliciously scented oils, having my face softly touched and experiencing beginner’s mind.
I don’t delight in people pretending to be experts in areas they are not expert in, dogma or closed minds.
I delight in transcendent moments in art, letting myself get soaked in the rain and resting out on my lawn in the darkness of the night… all by myself and wishing there was the just-right-soul with me and knowing… all in good time.
I don’t delight in outlandish criticism, gossip and humor based on ridiculing others.
I do delight in Aphra Behn, Madam CJ Walker, Emma and Katherine.
I don’t delight in destructive forces.
I do delight in intelligence – curiosity – and gentleness.
I don’t delight in militarism, cowards and people who hold so tightly to what they have that there is no space for anything new to come in.
I delight in quiet and I delight in the booming sounds of creativity. I delight in not-knowing and I delight in sheer audacity. I delight in courage and boldness. I delight in Johann Wolfang von Goethe, William Blake, Rainer Rilke, Mary Cassat and Diane Lane.
I delight in my own growth and discovery, I delight in my students, I delight in the students-who-are-coming. I delight in YOU. I delight in ME.
I delight in being on-stage and collaborating with actors to pull their best performances on stage. I don’t delight in bickering. I delight in color and light. I delight in tightly spaced harmonies.
I don’t delight in needless yelling.
I delight in being scared and doing it anyway. I delight in passion of all kinds: Sensual, Creative, Sexual, Exploratory.
I delight in tears. I delight in laughter. I delight in healing. I delight in the clouds. I delight in the moon. I delight in delight.  I delight in you. I delight in me. I delight in us. I delight in what is possible when we create, together.
