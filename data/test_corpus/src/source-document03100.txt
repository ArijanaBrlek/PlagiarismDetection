Mothers are the people who influence our lives right from our birth. As we grow up, we learn lot many things from them. In the process of bringing us up they enable us to differentiate between good and bad. Sometimes they do it intentionally and sometimes indirectly and unknowingly. As we spend a major part of our lives with these sweet moms, we memorize each and every moment spent in their company. No doubt all those sweet moments are equally precious for us but still some of them are even more special and hence we cherish them. Such special moments get stored in our memory and we love recall them repeatedly, enjoy them and sometimes also share them with others. This is just because certain incidents leave a deep impact on our mind as well as heart. Here are few such interesting stories and incidents that would certainly amuse you.
