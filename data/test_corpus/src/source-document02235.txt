Poker Betting Structure
Limit
In Limit poker, every bet/raise is made with a fixed amount. The only valid bet/raise is equal to the limit, for example $5 in the first two rounds and $10 in the last two, in $5-$10 Limit Hold’em. There is a cap of four bets/raises per betting round.
No-Limit
In No-Limit, there is no upper limit to what a player can bet or raise, besides the player’s own chip stack. However, a bet/raise must be at least equal to the stakes and the latest bet/raise of that round, for example $5 in $5-$5 No-Limit. There is no cap on the number of raises.
Pot-Limit
In Pot-Limit, the maximum bet/raise is equal to the present value of the pot, plus the amount needed by the player to call. However, a bet/raise must be at least equal to the stakes and the latest bet/raise of that round, for example $5 in $5-$5 No-Limit. There is no cap on the number of raises.
