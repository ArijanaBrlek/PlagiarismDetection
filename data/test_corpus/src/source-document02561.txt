TECHNICAL MANAGER
Michael
Where do we start when it comes to Michael! He’s managed to amass a huge amount of experience in the music industry over the years, starting at the tender age of 18 touring around Europe with his twin brother promoting their own dance tracks and buying their own 24 track-Recording Studio. Having spent time at Pete Waterman Limited (the home of Stock Aitken and Waterman) where he programmed keyboards  and pitched vocals by ear (no auto tune in those days!), Michael also enjoyed collaborations with renowned Record producer Tony Visconti (T-Rex, David Bowie) and Swanyard Records where he remixed the classic dance tune ‘Pump up the Jam’.
Michael then started songwriting after being signed to EMI when a track he wrote was picked up at a songwriting seminar. Through EMI, Michael wrote for a selection of artists from Celine Dion and Dannii Minogue and during this time, he even got to know Simon Cowell!
It seems as though his lifestyle back then was “a little crazy”, to-ing and fro-ing from England to Miami, living the true ‘Rock n Roll’ lifestyle at celebrity parties and music awards, writing a real cross-section of songs for Leanne Rhymes, Louise and the Honeyz and he’s even been in a Spice Girls video. Michael then signed with BMG, working on Pop Idol in Australia (Guy Sebastian) and Singapore (Taufik) with his tracks being used as the winning song. As a producer and songwriter, he utilized his skills in helping to put together a band called ‘Protocol’ and got them signed with Polydor.
It was during this time that Michael decided it might be time for him to calm things down and focus on what was really important to him…his family.  However he continues to enjoy success with writing music for television, recently finding out one of his pieces was used for the popular US TV series ‘Charmed’.
Moving to a career in digital media innovations and having been involved from the initial concept of the Website and the MultiPlayer, he thinks SMHTP is a great idea. “It’s a unique opportunity that’s never been available, to get musicians to play their favorite tracks and eventually play along with the actual artist.” With all Michael’s experience we’re glad to have him on the SMHTP team!
