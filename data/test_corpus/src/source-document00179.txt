Hughes engaged in various mining business endeavors before capitalizing on the oil discovery in Texas, as a result of which he began devoting his full time to the oil business. On he filed the basic for the Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit, and on was granted two patents for this rock drill. Hughes had patented a that penetrated medium and hard rock with ten times the speed of any former bit, and its discovery revolutionized drilling. It is unlikely that he actually invented the two-cone roller bit, but his legal experience helped him in understanding that its patents were important for capitalizing on the invention. According to the show , several other people and companies had produced similar drill bits years earlier. In its initial tests at Goose Creek Oilfield in 1909 where the first for oil in Texas was occurring in , twenty-one miles southeast of Houston on , the Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit penetrated 14 ft (4.3m) of hard rock in 11 hours which no previous equipment had been able to penetrate at all.

He co-founded the with based in Houston, Texas in 1909, and after Sharp's death in 1912 took over management. Hughes began purchasing the Sharp stock immediately and by 1918 had acquired full ownership of the company. The essential asset of Hughes Tool Company (renamed) were the 10 August 1909 patents for his dual-cone rotary drill bit. The fees for this technology were the basis of Hughes Tool's revenues, and by 1914 the dual-cone roller bit was used in eleven U.S. states and in thirteen foreign countries. After Hughes Sr.'s death in 1924, his only child Howard R. Hughes, Jr. assumed control of the company as its sole owner. Nine years later Hughes Tool Company engineers created a , and from 1934 to 1951 Hughes' market share approached 100 per cent. Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit found virtually all the oil discovered during the initial years of rotary drilling, and Howard Junior became the wealthiest person in the world. During 1972 he made the tool company public and realized $150 million the day it sold. Sharp-Hughes Tool Company Walter Benona Sharp licensing tri-cone rotary drill bit [4]
