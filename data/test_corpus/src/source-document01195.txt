This is the new web site for Hearsat.org. HearSat was originally created as a mailing list and website in November 1995. The idea was conceived by John Corby (VA3KOT) in Canada and the late Ivan Artner (HA5TS) in Hungary. HearSat was modeled after the SeeSat mailing list and website but was targeted towards satellite enthusiasts who are interested in monitoring radio signals from satellites. The web site and mailing list were originally hosted by Grove Enterprises, publishers of Monitoring Times magazine until RA Labs, owned by Bob Arnold (N2JEU), stepped forward to generously offer hosting services. HearSat remains indebted to Bob for his continued support. The mailing list is now hosted on the QTH network (www.qth.net) owned by Al Waller (K3TKJ). The content of Hearsat.org is dynamically managed by a group of active satellite monitoring enthusiasts. If you are reading this site and what to add some content, please register as a user, then go to the forums and post in the appropriate place. There is an active IRC channel where you can chat to other satellite buffs in real time, you can get to this by using the 'Live Hearsat Chat Room' link in the left hand menu bar.
