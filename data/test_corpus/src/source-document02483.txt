Our ErgoRest arm supports and table edge supports/softeners improve comfort and safety.
ErgoRest Arm Supports
ErgoRests
ErgoRest arm supports help address a range of neck, shoulder and back pain resulting from poor postures at workstations. ErgoRest arm supports help workers wherever tasks require repetitive actions at or above the work surface. Sitting for long hours with the trunk in a straight or forward posture places greater loads on the vertebra in the lower lumbar region. ErgoRest forearm and arm supports help reduce these static loads on the lower back. Many who suffer a variety of cumulative trauma symptoms or discomforts and injuries in the neck, shoulder and elbow also find immediate relief with the arm supports. ErgoRest
