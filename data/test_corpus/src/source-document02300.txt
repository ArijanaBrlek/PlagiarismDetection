Union members Christine Baze and Tamika Felder are survivors of cervical cancer. They have used their experiences to let women know that the #1 risk factor for cervical cancer is not being screened regularly.
Additionally, both Christine and Tamika educate women about the link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, so that women understand that persistent high risk HPV infections are the cause of cervical cancer. The Pap test can detect cell changes caused by HPV, while the HPV test can detect the virus that causes these changes. The Pap test is the appropriate screening test for women younger than 30; a Pap and HPV test together are appropriate for women 30 or older.
Unfortunately, these facts are not well known. As a result, the American Cancer Society estimates that in 2006, about 9,710 cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and nearly 3,700 women will die from it.
Christine, a member of Musicians Local 9-535 in Boston, is a singer/songwriter who always dreamed of being a rock star. In 2000, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, before current cervical cancer screening technologies were available. In 2002, after recovering from surgery and treatment, she created Popsmear.org (), a non-profit organization that spreads her message through pop music. And in 2003 she launched a national musical tour, "The Yellow Umbrella Tour," to spread awareness about cervical cancer. After playing in six cities in 2003, the tour hit 20 cities in 2004 and 21 cities in 2005. www.popsmear.org
The 2006 Yellow Umbrellla Tour played in 36 cities. For more information, visit www.yellowumbrellatour.com
Tamika, now a member of AFSCME District Council 20, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in May 2001. After surgery and treatment, she, too, decided to tell her story as a way to get the message out. She had no health insurance and no union when she was diagnosed and had not been screened for a number of years. It never occurred to her that she might develop cervical cancer.
"I was a successful television producer, doing great shows and then cancer came into my life," she says. "I almost didn't make it."
In January 2005, Tamika created Tamika and Friends () to raise awareness about cervical cancer, its link to HPV and the importance of regular screening. The centerpiece of her program is House Parties of fiVe, a social gathering of friends that mixes "girl talk" with lessons to help women become more comfortable discussing their sexual health. At the end of each party, hosts encourage guests to pass what they have learned to family and friends, and many of these women pledge to visit their gynecologists for Pap tests and/or HPV screenings. www.tamikaandfriends.org
The enthusiasm of women who have attended these parties prompted Tamika to run a training program this summer to teach others how to run parties.
