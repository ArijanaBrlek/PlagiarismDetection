New Service and Leadership Enterprise at Michigan Tech
December 23, 2004
A new Service and Leadership Enterprise is being organized to add a service-learning component to Michigan Tech's educational experience. Michigan Tech students will use their ingenuity, education, and technical capabilities to solve problems of human or societal need. The first project will design a low cost, energy efficient dwelling on the Pine Ridge Lakota Reservation in South Dakota, using regionally-available building materials and with alternative energy generation capabilities. We are looking for students who wish to earn some course credit, conduct technical research, and do good all at the same time.
The work during Spring Semester is to define specific projects for the enterprise, with a site visit over Spring Break. Project work will commence in Fall, 2005. Travel expenses for the site visit will be paid by the enterprise sponsor.
If this is something that you would like to be involved with, contact Dr. Leonard Bohmann 7-2861 ljbohman@mtu.edu or Ms. Norma Boersma 7-2681 norma@mtu.edu for more information.
