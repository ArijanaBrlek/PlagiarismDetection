Nectar Solutions
The following are instructions to make your own nectar solutions for butterflies, hummingbirds and orioles. All solutions should be replaced at least once per week and more often in warm weather because this solution will ferment (spoil). Try not to place the feeder in direct sunlight as this will only speed up the fermentation process.
Butterfly Nectar
Mix 1 part sugar to 9 parts water. Boil this solution for a few minutes. Pour cooled mixture into your butterfly feeder. Store the rest in the refrigerator.

Hummingbird Nectar
Mix 1 part sugar to 4 parts water. Boil this solution for a few minutes. Pour cooled mixture into your hummingbird feeder. Store the rest in the refrigerator. Hummingbirds are attracted to red when foraging. However, do NOT use red dye in your nectar mixture!!! It is not clear if this has harmful affects on hummingbirds. If your feeder does not have red on it, tie a red ribbon to it.
