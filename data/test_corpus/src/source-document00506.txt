hey man,…. what u guys think….first of all who are you to tell whether you need arjun singh or not, with just 10% of population…. if you talk then talk sensibly. have u ever thought before speaking. your comments are contradictory themselves. Either say that creamy layer is taking seats or say 45% of IIT reserved seats go unfilled. arent these two statements by u contradictory. who says reservation doesnt help. in 1960s nobody got into medical college in states or 2-3 when seats were 20……now 20 times get qualified and they fight..isnt that the effect of reservation. Why not caste system in reservation, when u guys kepts us starved for so long. u r very mean when the RDA president of AIIMS is himself an OBC and his wife is holding an OBC reserved position. why dont u ask his wife to resign. where u go when AIIMS graduate gets PG seat at 15% and ST gets at 50%. where you go when AIIMS still has its own reservation. is that merit. where u go when rich people get into private colleges easily. who is rich. majority of general category. even if OBC reservation gets into phases, who is at loss? we or u?.. just remember one thing. u were having ur maximum power and maximum number. see wats happening…..now it ll only get worse for you. reservation ll exist forever and u cant do anything. i am not a supporter of arjun singh, nor i m dependent on reservation, nor i favor OBC reservation in its present situation. but i favor reservation. reason is caste system in india. i strongly recommend you guys to look into caste system in real and not through this ****ing media. then u ll find the reality why reservation is must. a***

Anonymous @8:40 PM Dude, Do u really feel reservations are an answer to social unjustice? If so what happened in these 55 years? U talk and comparing 1960’s and now. I tell u that if politicians are good and give free and good education I am sure it will be 10 times as high as now and will be based on competition / merit.
I want caste system to be erased. But reservations just remind us that u r either SC / STC / OBC / FC or another fucking caste. I want scholarships to study based on merit or economical status. I don’t want reservation’s. They just divide us.
And as a final note, when u are in a hospital waiting for a surgery do u out u r life in the hands of a student who just got into medical field by reservations? I think we all know the answer.

Hey man
I wonder where exists still caste system in India. If all it exists its through reservations. So an immediate step to dismantle caste system is to remove reservations based on caste. then the whole issue of discrimination itself doesnt exist. Now if you say the reservations are going to exist for ever then it would be at the peril your dignity (well if you have any left) So then before commenting just think twice

Caste system is unfortunately still exist in India paticularly rural India. But I don’t think reservations is an answer for that.
I too support scholorships based on economical status to everyone but not without merit. Though, the standard of our high scools are very poor, that is one reason why poor people are not able to compete with the students from private scoools (not always but true provided both students have same abilities).
So, we should first improve the standards of our high scools and elementary schools. Then we can remove the reservations from 10+2 onwards and limit the admission based on the merit alone.
