Recent Changes
For 2009, Land Rover added a 110 counterpart to the 90 Defender SVX special edition line. Worldwide, only 1800 units will be available. It will feature the same trim and livery as the aforementioned 90. [1]
In Late 2007, Land Rover quietly unveiled the 200-unit (140 Defender 90 soft-tops and 60 90 station wagons) special edition at the British Red Cross Ball to commemorate 's 60th Anniversary. The refreshed iconic off-roader will sport a metallic black livery with subtle satin black decals and is available in 90 soft-top and 90 station wagon versions. The front fascia is facelifted with a bare aluminum finish, clear lens headlights and a new front grille. The body recieves tubular side-steps, 'diamond turned' five spoke alloy wheels and reinforced aluminium front undershield while the rear fascia will be updated with LED rear lights.Land Rover Defender SVX Land Rover
The interior features Recaro sport seats, alloy gear knobs, satellite navigation, iPod dock, a Premium sound system caged in a metallic silver tubular rollcage that also supports a tailor-made, removable black fabric roof. Each SVX will have a numbered plaque with the first one already donated to the British Red Cross for auction. Production is set to begin in the Spring of 2008. [2]
In September 2006, Land Rover released information on a series of long-anticipated changes to the Defender, most of which were implemented to meet upcoming emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine will be dropped, being replaced by an engine from Ford's DuraTorq line, built in their factory in Dagenham. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit and the famous London taxi built by Manganese Bronze. The engine's lubrication and sealing system has been adapted for use in wet, dusty conditions and to maintain lubrication at extreme angles in off-road use. Re-tuning the engine means that the power level will remain the same (122 horsepower), but with a lower power peak speed to provide better performance when towing and better acceleration. Torque output will rise from 221 lb-ft to 265 lb-ft due to the fitting of a variable-geometry . This also helps produce a much wider spread of torque than the Td5, from 1500 rpm to 2000 rpm. turbocharger
The engine will be mated to a new 6-speed . 1st gear is lower than the previous gearbox for better low-speed control, whilst the higher 6th gear is intended to reduce noise and fuel consumption at high speeds. A new transfer box will also be fitted, but using the same ratios as before. gearbox
The other major changes will be to the interior. The current layout is essentially the same as that used on the original One Ten from 1983 (which was in turn very similar to that used on the Series III from 1971). 2007 will see an all-new dashboard, with a full-width facia and different instrumentation. Instruments come from the , and some of the centre panels come from the recently-facelifted Ford Transit. Some switchgear is carried over from the previous interior. A brand new heater/ventilation system will be fitted, improving de-misting and heater performance. Noise levels will also be reduced. dashboard Discovery 3
Other interior changes are to the seating layout. Upcoming legislation from the European Union will outlaw the inward-facing seats used in the rear of previous Land Rover . The 2007 Defender will replace the 4 inward-facing seats currently used with two forward-facing seats. This will make the Defender 90 Station Wagon a 4-seater vehicle (reduced from 6 or 7), and the Defender 110 Station Wagon a 7-seater (reduced from 9, and in previous years as much as 12). Whilst this is a big reduction in capacity, it brings the Defender in line with its competition, which have generally used this layout for many years. The new rear seats fold up to maintain cargo capacity. Station Wagons
The only external changes are detail changes. The has been redesigned, needing a bulge in the bonnet to allow the new engine to fit in the engine bay whilst meeting pedestrian safety rules, which dictate a certain distance between the bonnet and the top of the engine. The new dashboard and ventilation system has required the removal of the distinctive air vent flaps underneath the windscreen which have been a feature of all previous Land Rover utility models. Whilst the flaps have been deleted, the bulkhead pressing remains the same, so the outlines of where the flaps would be are still present. bonnet

Current Generation: (1998present)
The last major change was the fitting of another diesel engine. The Tdi could not meet emissions regulations, bound to be introduced in 1999, so in 1998 the Defender was fitted with an all-new 2.5-litre, five-cylinder in-line turbodiesel engine, badged the Td5. This replaced the Tdi as the only available power unit. The engine used electronic control systems to provide 11 horsepower more than the Tdi, and much improved refinement. Traditionalists were critical of the electronic systems deployed throughout the vehicle, fearing that these would fail when used in extreme conditions. This has not proved to be the case, but the increased complexity means that repairs and upgrades to the engine have to be done by someone with necessary electronic equipment, which has led home mechanics to prefer to buy second-hand Tdi-powered vehicles. However the Td5 as of 2007 is to be replaced by the 's DuraTorq engine to comply with emissions regulations also the seating layout has been changed to comply with new seat belt regulations and the traditional air flaps will be removed and replaced with air con to the distress of many fans all over the world. Euro III Ford Transit
Another new vehicle is the Defender 110 Double Cab, featuring a station wagon style seating area, with an open pick up back. Although prototypes had been built in the series days, it was not until the late 1990s that this popular and adaptable vehicle got into production.
Now, more than ever, there is a strong division in sales pitch between the Station Wagon versions and the commercially-intended Pick-Ups and Van-bodied versions. Modern vehicles can be very luxurious. The "XS" Station Wagon was introduced in 2002 as a top-spec level, while the "County" package can now be applied to every model in the line-up. XS models come with many "luxury" features, such as heated windscreen, heated seats, air conditioning, electronic traction control and leather seats. These are popular with buyers in the UK and other developed countries, who either use the vehicle for on-road duties such as towing or people-moving, or simply as an interesting and fashionable alternative to an . estate car
At the other extreme, basic models are still popular with farmers, industrial and commercial users, as well as the emergency services. It finds willing buyers in over 140 countries. Land Rover still provides a staggering range of special conversions such as hydraulic platforms, fire engines, mobile workshops, ambulances and breakdown recovery trucks.
The Defender is very much an anachronism in today's vehicle marketplace. It is still largely hand assembled, and unlike most modern cars and trucks, all the major body panels and sub-assemblies simply bolt together. A Defender can literally be broken down to its chassis with simple hand tools — there is no structure. This is actually an advantage when used extensive for off road travel — unibody vehicles can weaken over time, but there are no such stress points on a Defender. This feature allowed Land Rover vehicles to be shipped anywhere in the world as "CKD" ("completely knocked down") kits, but has become a liability because of the high cost of labour in the UK where the vehicles are primarily manufactured today. unibody
Both enthusiasts and commercial users appreciate the bolt-together construction of the vehicle, for it not only means that modifications and accessories are easy to fit, but dented or damaged panels can easily be replaced with replacements. It also means that the bodywork of the vehicle gives absolutely no structural strength (it can be completely removed, leaving just the chassis and bulkhead/firewall if needed). This has its advantages in that modifications, damage or corrosion in the bodywork cannot compromise the vehicle's strength, but also means that the upper bodywork offers little or no protection in the event of the vehicle rolling over. Roll-over cages are popular modifications fitted by many users, and were standard fitment to all North American Specification (NAS) and 50th Anniversary Defenders. The simple construction of the vehicles has another advantage, which is that given a basic set of spanners, an individual vehicle can be switched between many of the various bodystyles available. For example, it is not uncommon for enthusiasts to fit a "Soft Top" canvas hood during the summer months, switching to an aluminium panel "Hard Top" van-back during the winter. Only long-wheelbase Station Wagons cannot be changed to other body types because of their unique five-door arrangement, the lack of any lateral interior bulkheads and a differently-shaped chassis to accommodate the central row of seats. Whilst these procedures could in theory still be carried out on even the latest vehicles, the amount of interior trim, panelling and electrical wiring carried in the roof and side panels of a more modern Land Rover means that such swapping is not as quick or practical as it once was.

The 127 and 130
From 1985 Land Rover introduced a third wheelbase to its utility line-up, a 127-inch twin-axle vehicle designed to accommodate larger, heavier loads than the One Ten. Naturally called the Land Rover 127, it was designed specifically with use by utility and electrical companies in mind, as well as military usage. In its standard form it is a five-door six-seater consisted of the front half of a One Ten Station Wagon, and the rear of a One Ten High-Capacity Pick Up (HCPU). The logic was that this allowed a workcrew and their equipment to be carried in one vehicle at the same time. The 127 could carry up to 1.4 tons payload, compared to the 1.03 tons payload of the One Ten and the 0.6 tons of the Ninety.
127s were built on a special production line, and all started life as One Ten chassis. These were then cut in two and the 17-inches of extra chassis length welded on before the two original halves were reunited. 127s did not receive their own dedicated badging like the other two models, instead they used the same metal grille badges as used on the Series III 109 V8 models, that simply said Land-Rover. Station Wagon
Although the standard body-style was popular, the 127 was a popular basis for conversions to specialist uses, such as mobile workshops, ambulances, fire engines or even flatbed transports. In South Africa, the Land Rover factory there offered a 127 Station Wagon with seating for 15. Land Rover also offered the 127 as a bare chassis, with just front bodywork and bulkhead, for easy conversion.
Initially held back by the low power of the Land Rover engines (other than the thirsty petrol engine), the 127 benefited from the improvements to the line-up, and by 1990 was only available with the two highest power engines, the 134-horsepower 3.5-litre V8 petrol, and the 85-horsepower 2.5-litre Diesel Turbo. V8
With the introduction of the Defender name in late 1990, along with the 200Tdi engine, the 127's name was changed to the Land Rover Defender 130. The wheelbase remained the same; the new figure was simply a tidying up exercise. More importantly, 130s were no longer built from "cut-and-shut" 110s, but had dedicated chassis built from scratch.
The 130 remains available with only the 6-seater HCPU bodystyle as standard, and followed the same engine and other technical changes as the rest of the Defender range, including the fitting of a new interior and 2.4-litre engine in 2007. Ford DuraTorq

Defender 90 and 110
The biggest change to the Land Rover came in late 1990, when it became the Land Rover Defender, instead of the Land Rover Ninety or One Ten. This was because in 1989 the company had introduced the Discovery model, requiring the original Land Rover to acquire a name. The Discovery also had a new engine. This was also loosely based on the existing 2.5-litre turbo unit, and was built on the same production line, but had a modern alloy cylinder head, improved turbocharging, intercooling and . The 200Tdi as it was called produced 107 hp (111 in the Discovery), and 188 lb ft of torque (195 lb ft in the Discovery), which was nearly a 25% improvement on the engine it replaced. The reason for the engine being detuned was to reduce engine stress and improve service life under prolonged periods of high engine speeds, such as when engaged in heavy towing, which the company reasoned were more likely to be encountered with a utility Land Rover than with a Discovery. turbodiesel direct injection
This engine finally allowed the Defender to cruise comfortably at high speeds, as well as tow heavy loads speedily on hills while still being economical. At a stroke Land Rover removed all the other engine options (now redundant in the face of such a good package in a single engine). Some enthusiasts consider the 200Tdi to be the best engine fitted to the vehicle.
1994 saw another development of the Tdi engine, the 300Tdi. This was the same capacity, and both the Defender and the Discovery had engines in the same state of tune (111 ho, 195 lb ft), and had the same basic layout, but had over 200 changes to improve the refinement and on-road performance of the engine. However, in the process the economy of the engine was reduced slightly, as was the ability for it to be serviced by the owner.
Throughout the 1990s the vehicle climbed more and more upmarket, while remaining true to its working roots. If ordered without any optional extras, the Defender was a basic working tool. If the owner wanted, any number of accessories could transform it into a vehicle that was perfectly acceptable as an everyday method of transport, while still retaining excellent off-road abilities. This was epitomised by the limited edition 50th Anniversary Defender 90 from 1998 which was equipped with automatic transmission, air conditioning, roll-over protection cage and powered by the Range Rover 4.0-litre V8 engine.

Land Rover Ninety and One Ten
The name was adopted in 1990 as a measure to distinguish the utility Land Rover model from the and , which were moving rapidly up-market — especially in the US. Production of what is now referred to as the Defender began in 1983 as the Land Rover 110, a simple name which refers to the 110 inch (2794 mm) length of the wheelbase. The Land Rover 90, with 93 in (2362 mm) wheelbase, and Land Rover 127, with 127 in (3226 mm) wheelbase, soon followed.Defender Discovery Range Rover
Outwardly, there is little to distinguish the post-1983 vehicles from the Series Rovers which had been in production since the late 1940s. A mild facelift of revised grille styling and the fitting of wheel arch extensions to cover wider-track axles are the most noticeable changes. Also the windscreen was changed from a two, to a one panel screen. Defender was, however, a complete modernisation of the former Series platform. Specifically:
Defenders use on all four wheels, whereas Series vehicles had . This gave a more comfortable ride when the vehicle was lightly laden and improved axle articulation to some degree. coil springs leaf springs
The new range featured a permanent four-wheel drive system as used since 1970 on the , featuring a two-speed transfer gearbox with a lockable differential. Series Land Rovers (with the exception of the first generation of Series I models and the 109-V8 types) had selectable four-wheel drive, so were only capable of being driven in two-wheel drive on the road. Range Rover
As part of the radical update, a new series of progressively more powerful and more modern engines were designed, although the Series III engine line-up remained in place when the vehicles were first launched.
The interior was modernised, and a one-piece windscreen replaced the traditional split-screen of the Series models. Other details included the removal of the distinctive "Safari Roof" (see above).

Note on names and badges
Between 1983 and 1990 the coil-sprung utility Land Rovers were officially known as the or , with the number spelled out in full in advertising and in handbooks and manuals. These vehicles carried badges above the radiator grille that (rather confusingly) said or , with the number rendered numerically. From late 1989, following the introduction of the , the front badge simply said or . From 1991, when the name was adopted the vehicles became the or the . These carry front badges that say , with a badge on the rear of the vehicle saying or . Just to add to the confusion, the 127-inch wheelbase available from 1985 was always marketed with the name rendered numerically (i.e. as the ). Following the adoption of the Defender name, it became the , although the wheelbase remained unchanged.Land Rover NinetyOne TenLand Rover 90Land Rover 110Discovery90110DefenderDefender 90Defender 110DefenderDefender 90Defender 110Land Rover 127Defender 130
Most of the changes to the Ninety/One Ten models were minor detail changes. The One Ten was launched in 1983, and the Ninety followed in 1984. From 1984, winding windows were fitted (Series models and very early One Tens had simple sliding panels), and a 2.5-litre, 68 hp (51 kW) diesel engine was introduced. This was based on the earlier 2.25-litre engine, but had a more modern fuel-injection system as well as increased capacity. A low compression version of the 3.5-litre V8 Range Rover engine was available too which transformed performance at the expense of fuel economy.
From 1985 a new chassis type was available, the 127-inch (see below). This was the first time such a specialised chassis had been built in-house. Previously, even longer vehicles had been built, many featuring 6-wheel drive, but all by private conversion companies. The new 127 was part of Land Rover's plan to improve profitability by taking in such work to its own Special Vehicles Department, which was developed from the Special Projects Department that had been in existence for many years.
This period saw Land Rover begin to market the utility Land Rover as a private recreational vehicle. While the basic pick-up, Station Wagon and van versions were still working vehicles, the County Station Wagons, with improved interior trim and more comfortable seats were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practise in the car industry - the slight changing of County model from year to year to constantly attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and a steady trickle of new "lifestyle" accessories that would have been unthinkable on a Land Rover a few years ago, such as radio/cassette players, styled wheel options, headlamp wash/wipe systems and new accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks.
1986 saw an important development. For many years Land Rovers had been criticised for their low-powered engines. The concept of a simple, low-stress, low power engine had worked for decades, but modern buyers demanded more. A turbo-diesel engine, closely based on the 2.5-litre four-cylinder diesel engine already used, was introduced. This unit produced 85 hp (a 13% increase over the naturally-aspirated unit, and 150 lb ft of torque at 1800 rpm, an impressive 31.5% increase. This finally provided a powerful yet economical powerplant for the vehicle. The engine was only intended to be a short term solution to compete with more advanced Japanese competitors, but was quickly adopted as the standard engine for UK and European markets. The engine was marketed as the "Diesel Turbo" (to differentiate it from diesel-engined Range Rovers, which used Italian VM Motori engines badged as the "Turbo D"). Early engines gained a reputation for short service lives, with problems such as bottom-end failures and cracked pistons. Small changes made in 1989 solved many of these problems, but the engine is still avoided by some. It is ironic that Land-Rover has developed a 2.5-litre 5 main bearing Turbo Diesel engine as early as 1962 for the 129-inch Truck prototype.
This was a period of change and success for the company. The new vehicles, with their more modern engines, transmissions and interiors reversed the huge decline in sales that took place in the 1980s (a 21% fall in a single year, 1980-81). This growth was mainly in the domestic UK market and Europe; African, Australian and Middle-Eastern sales failed to recover significantly. The company itself adopted more modern practices, such as using marketing campaigns to attract new buyers who would not previously have been expected to buy a Land Rover. The operation was streamlined, with most of the satellite factories in the West Midlands that built parts for the Land Rover being closed and production brought into the Solihull factory, which was expanded.
To maximise sales in Europe, Land Rover set up the Special Vehicles division, which handled special low-number conversions and adaptations to the vehicles. The bulk of the division's work was the construction of stretched-wheelbase mobile workshops and crew carriers for British and European utility companies, often including 6-wheel-drive conversions, but more unusual projects were undertaken, such as the construction of an amphibious Land Rover Ninety used by the company as part of its sponsorship of Cowes Week from 1987-90. The Special Projects division also handled specialised military contracts, such as the building of a fleet of 127-inch V8-powered Rapier-missile launchers for the British Army. The Rapier system actually consisted of three Land Rovers: a 127 which carried the launching and aiming equipment, and two 110s which carried the crew and additional equipment.

Future
Replacing the Defender with a new model has been in the planning stages for many years. The current design is over 20 years old in its current form and, in some ways, directly evolved and updated from the Land Rovers of the 1940s. As modern private and commercial vehicles offer increasing levels of performance, comfort and refinement, the Defender is again in competition with Japanese products. These offer less off-road ability but are much more comfortable.
New methods of building the Defender have made the model profitable again (since the 1990s, the hand-built vehicle had been made at a loss), so its replacement has been less of a priority. Total replacement will be needed by 2010, when new regulations regarding crash safety for pedestrians will render the current design obsolete.
At present, the Defender does not reach the safety requirement for the USA, and only small batches of specially modified (and very expensive) vehicles have been sold there in the past. A replacement vehicle will almost certainly be designed to be legal in America.
