Animal shelter at JFK may shut down
Sadly the no-kill animal shelter long located at JFK airport's Cargo Area C is being displaced for longer runways. Apparently high rents and restrictive zoning laws are making finding a new home difficult. The organization needs $1.3 million. Good luck guys!! Bobby & The Strays
