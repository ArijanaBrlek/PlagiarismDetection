Price Glass
Price Glass is one of the oldest and yet most progressive of companies in the Bristol area, having been formed over 30 years ago. The company has expanded over the years and now offers Building and Installation Work, Glazing and Leaded Light Work in addition to Glass Cutting and a full range of allied products in our Shop. We have a comprehensive range of conservatories, windows and doors, which can offer low maintenance, high security and considerable reduction in noise levels and heat loss. Most of our customers prefer to go for our PVCu range, which is constructed from top-quality Profile 22, known throughout the trade to be one of the finest profiles on the market. We can also offer Thermal-break Aluminium Doors and Windows, and all comply with the new Regulation L, and come with a ten year Guarantee.
Windows
When it comes to windows, you can rely on Price Glass to provide quality workmanship with a full range of options. Our PVCu windows are custom-made from Profile 22, well known as one of the best quality profiles on the market. PVCu windows are available in three standard finishers, crisp clean white, Rosewood and Antique Oak. However any colour can be arranged upon request ensuring that all styles of home are catered for. PVCu double-glazed windows will keep your home warm and insulated, saving money on your heating bills, as well as reducing outside noise. No matter what shape, style or size your window is, we are able to replace it. All windows are internally glazed unless you require differently and we also offer wood and aluminium options in addition to PVCu. Individual windows can be in Georgian style or leaded; and in addition we are able to offer the highly prestigious Pilkington Activ glass with its 'self-cleaning' properties. All windows come internally glazed as standard and have security shoot-bolt locking with fully lockable handles to give you maximum security. All our windows are 70mm profile with Pilkington 'K' glass to comply with the latest regulations.
Doors
The benefits of PVCu windows are also true of PVCu doors, which come complete with the new Safeware locks. All doors are available in a choice of White, Rosewood or Antique Oak, and are glazed in toughened Pilkington 'K' glass. Handles are in a choice of Gold, White or Silver in either Pad or Lever design. We are also skilled in fitting aluminium or traditional wooden doors, both internal and external. French doors are very popular again, and whether open or closed they bring the garden into your home on the brightest or dullest days; however if sliding Patio doors are your choice, once again we have just the ones for you.
