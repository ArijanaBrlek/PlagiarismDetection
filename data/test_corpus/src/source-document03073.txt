Mackenzie River Valley and Delta, Canada
The river transports over half of the freshwater flowing through the north of Canada and carries the most sediment in the circumpolar north to the Arctic Ocean. This discharge of freshwater and energy in the ocean plays a significant role in regulating the circulation of the world's oceans and climate systems. The Mackenzie River Valley is rich in wildlife. A pristine sub-arctic region, the Mackenzie Valley is home to huge populations of caribou as well as black bears, grizzly bears, moose and wolves. It is also a major North American migratory corridor for waterfowl breeding along the arctic coast. The Mackenzie Valley holds 1.5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and 9 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven gas reserves. The Mackenzie Delta and Canadian Beaufort Seas are thought to hold significantly greater reserves, with an estimated 5.8 billion barrels of oil and 65 tcf of gas. Plans to build a 1,000 km long pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley are proceeding apace, despite the lack of protected areas in the ecotypes that the pipeline will impact. WWF believes that any future development of natural gas reserves in Canada's Mackenzie Valley should only occur in full accordance with government and industry commitments to "sustainable development". At a minimum, this requires that prior to completion of a major energy corridor, a network of protected areas be established that adequately represents the ecoregions affected by such development and safeguards key wildlife habitats and culturally significant areas. This network of protected areas should be identified and championed by the people who live there. The NWT Protected Areas Strategy (PAS) and an associated Five-year Action Plan to 2009, is a community based initiative that is designed to protect areas of cultural and ecological significance before the development begins. The Mackenzie Valley is a massive wilderness area and is still mostly untouched. Here we have the opportunity to do it right and conserve first. Along with the other NGO partners in the PAS, WWF-Canada has committed to raising 33 percent of the funds needed to implement the PAS Action Plan, subject to a 50 percent federal lead, with the remaining 17percent to be provided by the Government of the NWT, Aboriginal organisations and industry. Comprehensive regional land use planning should also be completed ahead of major industrial activity, to ensure that special cultural and ecological areas are adequately mapped, protected and functionally connected. .

The Mackenzie River is a critical homeland for indigenous peoples and for wildlife. The valley contains one of the world's last great free-running river systems. It is the longest river in Canada and the Delta the largest in Canada with the second largest wetland area in the country.
