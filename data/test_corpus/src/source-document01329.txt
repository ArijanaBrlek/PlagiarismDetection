Does anyone know if they improved the CD rom for the 2005 edition?Anyone Know?
I waited till june 15 to but the new edition 2005 of this book.The software seems to have bugs. To review the tests they provide a new feature where we can upload results to the website. I thought it was a good strategy to get people to the website. But good strategies also need be well implemented...bugs in the software
After completing my first test I chose an option "upload results later" Without uploading the results I was not able to see my score.I could review the questions and see where I had gone wrong but the software doesnt give you a score. Unfortunately I couldnt "upload results later" as I couldnt find out how to.
After completing the second test I chose upload options now. The software ftp'ed my results and mentioned that I will be recieving an email and that I can check my results online. I still waiting for the email. Although I was able to log in to the princetonreview web site I cant find a test result section on the website.
