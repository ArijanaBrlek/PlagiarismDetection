After you've completed your roman shade or balloon shade and have it hanging in your window... you may face a common dilemma. What do you do with all of your loose lift cords?
After you've completed your roman shade or balloon shade and have it hanging in your window... you may face a common dilemma. What do you do with all of your loose lift cords?
You obviously can't cut them off... and if you have at least 3 lift cords, it can be messy. Plus, after putting all that work into making your roman shade just right, you want a clean finished product once installed.
To tidy up all those messy lift cords, do the following:Your solution is a cord drop.
1. Braid them together
2. Thread them through the top small hole of a cord drop
3. Knot the cords together
4. Slide the cord drop over the knot and trim off any excess lift cord
Now you have an attractive pull cord instead of multiple loose lift cords.
Cord drops can be found in a variety of styles. From small less obvious plastic cord drops to decorative wooden cord drops and tassels.
