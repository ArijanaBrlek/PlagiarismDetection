Right to counsel in imprisonable non-felony cases
Argersinger v. Hamlin
It is important to note, however, that not all provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to the states. In fact, in some cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has expressly refused to do so. For example, in (1884) the Court refused to incorporate the Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement to the states.Hurtado v. California

Interactions Between the State and Federal Systems
The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allows the federal courts to become involved in state cases if one of the rights protected (meaning incorporated) by the Fourteenth Amendment comes into play. The Fourteenth Amendment offers significant protection for personal liberties in that it opens the federal courts to those who are unsatisfied with the decisions of state courts when an incorporated (applicable) federal Constitutional provision is called into question.
In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment allows persons to sue in federal court if they believe that a state law or regulation deprives them of the "equal protection of the laws." The famous case of (1954) is an example of a situation where the "equal protection" clause was used in such a manner. This case struck down segregation in public schools, citing the practice as a violation of the federal "equal protection" clause. However, the states are free to do more than the minimum required by the Fourteenth Amendment and the U.S. Constitution. For example, in the case of (1973), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the unequal quality of school districts in rich and poor communities in Texas did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's "equal protection" clause. The Court said that the funding scheme was not " ... so irrational as to be invidiously discriminatory." It went on to conclude that, "The Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages."Brown v. Board of EducationSan Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez
However, in the case of (1989) the Texas Supreme Court found that the unequal quality of the state's school districts did violate the Texas Constitution. "We hold that the state's school financing system is neither financially efficient nor efficient in the sense of providing for a 'general diffusion of knowledge' statewide, and therefore it violates Article VII, Section 1 of the Texas Constitution," the Court said. Article VII, Section 1 of the Texas Constitution states: "A general diffusion of knowledge being essential to the preservation of the liberties and rights of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of the state to establish and make suitable provisions for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of free public schools."Edgewood v.
