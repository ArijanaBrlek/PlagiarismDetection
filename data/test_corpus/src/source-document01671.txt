Expansion is the center of attention at Disneyland.  This new theme park next to Disneyland celebrates the virtues of the Golden State with new rides, shopping, dining and entertainment experiences in Disneyland Center and The Grand Californian, a hotel next door to the new park. 
From the Yosemite Valley to Hollywood glitz, from beaches to the historic past, the new theme park is described as a California state of mind. 
Outside the park, West Street was renamed Disneyland Drive.  Disneyland Resort Plaza provides a gateway entrance to two theme parks instead of one which currently operates and has done so since 1955.  A 10,000 space parking structure allows cars directly off the 5 Santa Ana Freeway into the structure to minimize traffic congestion. The new California Adventure opened on Feb. 8, 2001. Disneyland opened nearly 50 years ago in 1955 and welcomes the next door partner.  The new park features California and its regions and include the tallest, longest theme park water ride and several thrill rides. 
For those hoping to do more than just experience the magic once or twice, jobs created as a result of the project are expected to be about 14,500 with 8100 of those in Anaheim.  New theme park jobs will primarily be entry-level positions offering training and career advancement opportunities. Win, win, win. $35 million per year to the State of California, $10 million/year to Orange County and $25 million per year to Anaheim.   
Do you know about FASTPASS, the free guest service for Space Mountain, Splash Mount and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin? Just insert your park entrance ticket into the FASTPASS turnstile and receive a designated window of time during which you can return.  This saves your place in line so you can do something else and return to enjoy the attraction with a minimal wait. IMPORTANT: You must use your current FASTPASS before receiving one to another attraction.  Visit the official Disneyland web site www.disneyland.com
