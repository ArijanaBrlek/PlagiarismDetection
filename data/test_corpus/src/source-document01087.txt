Today's retirement is so different from what prior generations experienced. Our potential to live longer has increased significantly, but that means our money must also last a lifetime. Annuities are unique in their ability to provide lifetime income and may be a good way for you to plan for a long and enjoyable retirement.
 
Annuities are long-term financial vehicles that are issued and guaranteed by an insurance company.
Sun Life Financial offers three types of annuities - Variable, Fixed, and Fixed Index.* Here is a summary of how each annuity can help grow your money based on how comfortable you are with risk, your investment time horizon and your financial needs.
To learn more about Sun Life Financial annuities, select "Variable Annuities," "Fixed Annuities," or "Fixed Index Annuity" on the toolbar above.
 
1. Keep in mind that the benefits of tax deferral in an annuity are not applicable to contracts purchased as an Individual Retirement Annuity (IRA) or inside some other tax-qualified retirement plan because these plans already have tax-deferred status. Therefore, you should purchase an annuity in such plans only if you value the other features that an annuity may offer (such as a lifetime income or death benefit) and are willing to pay the charges (if any) for those features. 2. All guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Guarantees do not apply to the performance or safety of amounts held in the variable sub-accounts of a variable annuity. 3. Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes and are subject to market fluctuation, investment risk, and possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results. If you are considering a variable annuity, this information is authorized for public use only when preceded or accompanied by a prospectus. Please read all carefully before investing or sending money. All withdrawals of taxable amounts, including earnings, are taxable as ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59 may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals will reduce the death benefit and cash surrender value. Annuities are issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) (Wellesley Hills, MA) in all states except New York. In New York, the contracts are issued by Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York (New York, NY). Variable annuity products are distributed through Sun Life Financial Distributors, Inc. All three companies are members of the Sun Life Financial group of companies. Certain products are not available in all states.
*Pennsylvania and New Jersey residents: Some materials you receive for a Sun Life Financial fixed index annuity may refer to this product as a fixed index annuity or an equity indexed annuity. These terms are interchangeable.
