Department of Motor Vehicles Save Time, Go Online Campaign Customer Service The Department of Motor Vehicles unveiled its first-ever marketing campaign in 2007, titled Save Time, Go Online. The campaign is part of the overall Driving Change brand. The Departments overall goal is to promote and increase the use of available online services and drive customers to do business with the DMV over the Internet, on their time, and at their convenience. The campaigns objectives were to: create a single message/image; raise awareness of the online DMV services currently available; promote new services as they become available; encourage increased use of online services as a primary means of conducting business with the DMV; and, to enhance the public image of the DMV. The DMV recognized that increased use of the Departments site would not only lessen the burden on DMV field offices, but also help DMV customers save time and effort by offering a convenient way to access common services. It was important to publicize these efforts while at the same time, brand the DMV as a 21st Century government entity providing up-to-date, secure resources for California drivers and residents. The campaign also included two primary creative elements: fun and creative billboard ads and entertaining radio spots in English and Spanish. Both mediums were designed to help promote the fast and efficient services offered by the DMV through the Departments newly-retooled Web site. The radio spots created a natural linkage consistent with the billboard campaign. The spots repeated the Web address several times and integrated the billboard slogan to tie back to the billboard creative. In a humorous and clever way, the radio script showcased the benefits of doing DMV business online and highlighted DMVs commitment to customer service. Online vehicle registrations numbered close to 4.9 million in 2007, an increase of 25 percent over 2006. Online driver license renewals also experienced a 25 percent increase over 2006. While some of this increase occurred on the natural, campaign research shows a direct link between the increase of online business and the campaign. Of those surveyed, more than 30 percent of respondents indicated they had paid for a vehicle registration or license renewal over the Internet for the first time; of these individuals, approximately 36 percent indicated they had heard or seen the Departments messaging.Department:
