Pvc casement windows give great flexibility to rooms that need regular airing, but still need the benefits of double glazed sealed units. A pvc casement window is side-hinged and opens outwards. The single pane stretches from top to bottom. This means that the whole pane opens out and also opens fully to allow maximum airing. A pvc casement window can be single or double fronted.
This type of window is ideally suited to kitchens particularly when situated above sinks or other appliances. The fact that the window opens fully means that any unwanted smells or steam can be dissipated rapidly and without fuss. Conservatories and sun lounges are also good places for this type of window. Indeed any room that is liable to get overly warm benefits from the ability of the pvc casement window to catch the maximum of amount of breeze. Pvc casement windows are very easy to open as there is no lifting involved. This makes them ideal for any position where access is slightly hampered, such as above a counter or sink in a kitchen.
The fact that the window opens fully does bring some security concerns. However, the design of pvc casement windows has developed significantly. These days sophisticated locking mechanism have replaced the old simple latch system and so pvc casement windows are at least as secure as any others. The window and frame are typically manufactured as a single unit and the locking systems built in. It is also often possible to lock the window in an open position.
It is possible to get pvc casement windows in a wide variety of frames including metal, plastic and wood. The pane is typically double-glazed and the window is delivered with the frame as a complete double-glazed package. Pvc casement window make a great option for providing light and airy atmospheres to any room.
