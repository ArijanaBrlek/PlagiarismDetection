Background
Twenty-two healthy male blue-collarshift workers underwent 24-hour ECG recordings during each ofthe 3 different shifts (first, 6 to 2 ; second, 2 to 10; third, 10 to 6 ). Spectral analysis of heart rate variabilityover 24 hours provided the normalized markers of cardiac sympathetic (LF)and vagal (HF) modulation of the sinoatrial node activityand of the sympathovagal balance (LF/HF). LF and LF/HF exhibited24-hour oscillations with different times of maximum and minimumin accordance with the working and sleeping periods, respectively.Lower values of LF and LF/HF suggestive of a reduced cardiacsympathetic modulation were present when the job task was performedat night compared with the values observed when the work wasperformed during morning and evening.Methods and ResultsAMPMPMPMAMnunununu
Continuous weekly changes of time of maximumand minimum in the cardiac sympathetic and vagal autonomic controlmay play a role in the excessive rate of cardiovascular diseases inshift workers. The reduced values of the indexes of cardiac sympatheticmodulation during night work might be related to the presenceof sleepiness or diminished alertness, which in turn could facilitateerrors and accidents.Conclusions

The autonomic nervous system activity also oscillates over the24 hours. A multisynaptic pathway between the suprachiasmaticnucleus, responsible for circadian rhythms and daily changesin behavior and physiology, and several sympathetic and parasympatheticoutflows has recently been documented in animals by viral transneuronal labeling. Studies based on plasma and urinary catecholamine determinationsindicate that sympathetic nervous activity is higher duringthe day and reduced at night or during sleeping. Similarresults have been obtained by direct recording of peroneal sympatheticfibers, although not consistently. 11 12 13 14
In a study performed on healthy habitual day workers based onspectral analysis of heart rate variability over 24 hours, wepreviously observed that the index of cardiac sympathetic modulation, LF,was reduced during sleeping hours, increased with awakeningin the early morning, and was high during the remaining periodof the day, particularly during the work period.nu 15
In the present study, we hypothesized that a change in workingtime over 24 hours, as happens with a shifting schedule of work,may modify the 24-hour oscillation of the spectral markers ofcardiac sympathetic (LF) and vagal (HF) modulation and mightbe associated with a different level of cardiac autonomic modulationduring the different working periods.nunu
These aspects may be of paramount importance in attempts tobetter understand maladjustment to shift work and to assessthe neural modifications likely to facilitate work accidents.In fact, it is conceivable that a reduction in sympathetic toneduring night work might be attended by a decreased alertnessand deterioration of working performance, promoting an excessof accidents and errors in the performing of job tasks. In addition, the weekly changes in the time of maximumand minimum of cardiac sympathetic and vagal autonomic controlmight play a role in the higher rate of cardiovascular diseasesdescribed in shift workers. 16 1 2 3 4 5 17 18
   Methods
Population
PMAMPMAMPM
The mean age of subjects was 39±3 years. Each had 10years of experience in shift work. At the time of admissionto the study, every subject underwent a physical examinationand routine laboratory tests. We considered only normotensivesubjects who were free of any signs of disease and smoked <15cigarettes a day. All subjects had similar environmental andworking conditions.
Each subject underwent 24-hour ECG recording during the 3 differentshifts after 2 days of adaptation to the current shift. All ECGrecordings were obtained with a 2-channel Holter recorder (Reynolds,Traker model), starting at about 2 The workers were instructedto maintain a daily routine outside the firm as close as possibleto their habitual one. The Table shows the average time of workand sleep of the population during every shift.Experimental Protocol

RR Interval and Cardiac Autonomic Control Indexes During Sleeping Time and Working Period as Observed in Workers During 3 ShiftsTable 1.
The experimental protocol was approved by the hospital ReviewBoard in Human Research, and all subjects who participated inthe study provided written informed consent.
Twenty-fourhour Holter recordings were played back offlineby an analyzer unit (Cardio Data Holter Analysis System) at120 real time. Analog-to-digital conversion was performed at300 samples per second. The principles of the software for dataacquisition and spectral analysis have already been described. In the present study, we used a recursive version of theprogram, which provided, depending on individual heart rate,>200 consecutive spectra for every 24-hour ECG recording. Briefly, from the surface ECG, the computer program calculatesthe series of consecutive RR intervals as a function of beatnumber, thus obtaining the so-called tachogram. Thereafter,simple statistics (mean and variance) and the autoregressivecoefficients necessary to define the best estimate of the powerspectral density are calculated. Two major oscillatory componentscan be extracted from RR spontaneous variability : a high-frequency(HF, 0.25 Hz) component, an accepted marker of vagal modulationof the sinoatrial node activity, and a second low-frequency(LF, 0.10 Hz) component considered, when normalized, a markerof cardiac sympathetic modulation. In the present study,the power of the oscillatory components is presented both inabsolute (ms) and normalized units (nu). Normalization is obtainedby dividing the absolute power of each oscillatory componentby total power within 0.04 and 0.5 Hz and multiplying by 100. The LF/HF ratio is a convenient index of the reciprocalchanges of the sympathetic and vagal modulation of the sinoatrialnode discharge (sympathovagal balance).Data Analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Students test forpaired observations and 1-way ANOVA for repeated measures witha Newman-Keuls method posttest were used when appropriate. Differences wereconsidered significant at <0.05.Statistical Analysis

The 24-hour variations of spectral indexes of cardiac autonomic modulation during 3 shifts. In every shift, marker of cardiac sympathetic activity, LF, was higher during working time and lower when subjects were sleeping. Interestingly, night work period (third shift) was characterized by reduced values of LF compared with morning and evening working periods corresponding to other 2 shifts. Marker of cardiac vagal modulation, HF, showed circadian opposite pattern.Figure 1.nununu

The 24-hour changes of heart rate and index of cardiac sympathovagal balance LF/HF in 3 shifts. Notice that in every shift circadian oscillation of LF/HF ratio parallels 24-hour fluctuation of heart rate (HR). Lower values of LF/HF during night work (third shift) compared with other 2 shifts indicate reduced cardiac sympathetic modulation to heart rate when subjects were working at nighttime. Heart rate was similar in concomitance with 3 sleeping periods, and same pattern can be observed for LF/HF.Figure 2.
The Table summarizes the mean values of RR interval, its variance,LF, HF, and the LF/HF ratio observed during the workingperiods corresponding to each of the 3 different shifts. RRvalues and RR variance were similar in all shifts. The vagal-relatedspectral index HF was only slightly higher during the third shiftcompared with the others (Figure 1). Conversely, LF and theLF/HF ratio were lower when working activities had been performedat night time (third shift) compared with the working periodsof the first and second shifts (Figures 1 and 2).Working Periods and Different Shifts

As inferred from the Holter diary, sleeping time was different amongthe shifts, being longer during the second shift (the Table).Sleeping periods were characterized by similar values of RRinterval, RR variance (the Table), and the spectral indexes ofcardiac autonomic modulation in the 3 shifts (the Table and Figures1 and 2).Sleeping Periods and Different Shifts
   Discussion
References
The population of steel shift workers furnished the opportunityto deal with an identical working load because of the standardizationand repetition of job tasks in each of the 3 shifts, thus overcomingthe potential confounding effects induced by different physical and mental activities on power spectral components during24 hours. 24 25 24
The first major finding was that the spectral indexes of cardiac sympatheticand vagal modulation maintain their 24-hour fluctuations withmaximum and minimum values in accordance with the different workingand sleeping periods. Second, nighttime work was associated withlower values of LF and the LF/HF ratio, suggesting reducedcardiac sympathetic modulation compared with the morning andevening working periods.Major Findings
nu
The results of the present study suggest that regardless of thetime of day, work activity and sleeping time played a majorrole in generating the maximum and the minimum of the spectralmarkers LF and HF. Indeed, in every shift, LF and theLF/HF ratio were higher during working periods and lower atsleeping time, thus paralleling the 24-hour fluctuations ofheart rate. Conversely, HF was higher during sleeping hours.Autonomic Circadian Rhythms and Different Shifts
nunununu
The relationship between changes in the autonomic profile andworking and sleeping periods has previously been assessed onlyin habitual day workers, ie, in subjects with a lifestyle characterizedby fixed working and sleeping times. In this population, theoverall sympathetic activity was found to be higher during thedaytime compared with nighttime. In fact, plasma and urinarycatecholamine concentrations were higher during the day andlower during sleeping hours. Direct recordings of sympatheticnerve activity have documented a higher rate of sympatheticdischarge during wakefulness compared with the nonrapideye movement phase of sleep at night. In a study that usedpower spectral analysis of RR and blood pressure variabilities, LFand the LF/HF ratio, which reflects the sympathovagal interaction,were lower during sleeping hours, increased at wakening time,and were higher in concomitance with daily activity. Similarresults were obtained in continuously recumbent healthy subjects and by other studies that used EEG recordings to better definethe periods of wakefulness and the different stages of sleep. It is important to point out that normal cardiovascular neuralregulation is essential to maintain the 24-hour periodicity.In fact, the autonomic alterations attending diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and hypertension were found tobe associated with blunted 24-hour fluctuations of the spectralmarkers of cardiac autonomic control. 12 13 nu 15 26 27 28 29 30
The 24-hour oscillatory patterns of LF and LF/HF observedin the present study are synchronous in each shift with workingand sleeping periods and seem to differ from the circadian oscillationsof body temperature and plasma cortisol as observed in differentgroups of shift workers. Indeed, morning peak levelsof temperature and cortisol tend to move only slightly towardearly afternoon values when work is performed at nighttime,thus showing a time lag between their maximum and the workingperiod.nu 9 31 32 9 31 32
Finally, the continuous changes over the years of the time ofmaximum cardiac sympathetic modulation, as suggested by thepattern of the LF and the LF/HF indexes, might play a rolein the excessive rate of cardiovascular disease described inhabitual shift workers.nu 17 18
An important aspect of the present study is the observation thatthe spectral indexes of cardiac sympathetic modulation (LFand the LF/HF ratio) were lower when subjects worked at nightcompared with morning and evening periods of work, despite thefact that job assignments were similar during the 3 shifts.This finding is corroborated by the concomitant observationof slightly increased values of RR interval during night workcompared with the other 2 shifts.Different Working Periods and Cardiac Autonomic Control
nu
A previous study by Freitas et al did not observe any variationin the low-frequency component of RR variability in a group ofsecurity shift workers of an oil refinery considered duringmorning and night work. Differences in the experimental designand in the intensity of physical activity during working periodsmay account for the discrepancies with our results. 33
In the present study, the finding of a decrease in the cardiac sympatheticmodulation when work was performed at nighttime entails 2 majorconsiderations. First, it might reflect the presence of periods ofsleepiness or reduced alertness. It must be emphasized thatfor security reasons we could not assess the consciousness statedirectly by continuous EEG recordings. Nonetheless, a reductionin alertness or periods of sleepiness have been previously reportedin truckers and train drivers and in pilots during trainingsessions when the appropriate tasks were performed at nighttime.As a consequence, a higher rate of errors or accidents hasbeen observed compared with day work. Second, the fact thatthe indexes of cardiac sympathetic modulation, LF and LF/HF,were reduced during night work compared with the other diurnalworking periods may reflect the likely opposite influences exertedby the work-sleep schedule (according to which the physicaland mental activity attending job execution would increase LFand LF/HF) and the internal, schedule-independent, biologicalclock. In fact, in accordance with the latter, LF and theLF/HF ratio would have been reduced at night as happens in habitualdiurnal workers for a stress marker such as cortisol and forbody temperature. 34 35 36 4 1 nununu 6 7
