THREE PIECES FOR TROMBONE QUARTET
Catalogue Number: TQ975
$24.00
Don Sweete has brought forth another interesting composition for brass players. His is a difficult work for advanced musicians. The upper trombone part is in a high tessitura for the majority of the work but the melody parts are distributed throughout the ensemble. All parts are kept rhythmically interesting with frequent metre changes with many 7/8 and 5/8 bars. The lyrical second movement is surrounded by two fast articulated movements. The ending is a sure delight by audiences as the first trombone drives to the final high D.Three Pieces for Trombone Quartet
