The question of Korean names versus Chinese names resembles the Japanese name question in this article: The Korean word for Chinese characters is "Hanja." Korean letters, distinct from Hanja, are called "Hangul." Hangul are only visual representations of the vocal pronunciations of Korean. Therefore, Hangul do not have the visual appeal and meaning of Hanja. Guess what we use! At Good Characters, we transliterate your name into a Hanja (Chinese) name. We use traditional characters, standard or ancient script, for their classic and artistic value. 1. 2. 3.Choosing between Hanja and Hangul
