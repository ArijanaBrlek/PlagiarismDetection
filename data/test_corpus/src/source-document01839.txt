Collector Issue 42
Yep, our printer found them in a back room- a pristine, unopened box of the classic # 42- a jewel from our last publishing series that are otherwise out of print. These won last for long. This 100-page issue starts with photos of adobe restoration taken by photographer Bill Sears of Tucson in the Colonial town of Alamos, Sonora. There 4 pages about Foundation trench requirements for Earthen homes, then 5 pages about how to install brick floors, followed by articles on making adobes, adobe stabilization, speed leads and starting walls. One page on building a Roman arch is followed by 8 pages on adobe fireplace masonry. Next, craftsman Joe Gutierrez shows how to build a concrete windowsill, before he devotes almost 4 pages to the secrets of interior gypsum plastering on adobe and terr walls. Then, mason Al Knight of Albuquerque (who is still building) answers a series of cost and material questions- and on the next page, Paul Logsdon of Santa Fe shows how to cut corbels using a chain saw. Five pages on electrical wiring tips in adobe walls are followed by two passive solar home projects. There are 12 pages on bond beams, vigas and roofing solutions. A rare article by engineer Peter Harris gives charts for viga size and spacing under dirt roofs or contemporary roofs. Page 95 has a starter adobe layout- how to start small and expand later. There more in this ldie but goodiethan we can list.
