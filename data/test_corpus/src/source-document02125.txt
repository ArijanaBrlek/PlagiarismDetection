Tornadoes
"Tornado Alley" is the area of the country that runs north from Texas through eastern Nebraska and northeast to Indiana.
Just because you live elsewhere doesn’t mean that you’re safe from tornadoes. Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas may see more of these unpredictable and dangerous storms than other states, but the rest of the country gets its share of twisters too.
Should a wayward storm come your way, you can take several basic steps right now to protect your family and your home from disaster. Although Nationwide can't control the weather, we can help ease the financial woes that come from the damage or even loss of your home and possessions due to a tornado.®
Know the danger
May strike quickly, with little warning
May appear transparent until they pick up dust and debris
Peak in southern states from March through May, and in northern states, from late spring through early summer
Often have the following danger signs:
Dark, often greenish sky
A large, dark, low-lying cloud
Loud roar, similar to a freight train
Your home, your castle
Structures built to meet or exceed current model building codes for high-wind regions have a much better chance of surviving violent windstorms.
The Standard Building Code, developed by the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., is one source for information on how to fortify your home against fierce winds.
Although no home can withstand a direct hit from a severe tornado, good construction will help your home survive if it's on the fringe of the tornado's path.
Limit flying objects
Take these simple steps now to limit damage from flying objects:
Replace landscaping materials such as gravel and rock with mulch such as shredded bark
Keep trees and shrubbery trimmed, paying particular attention to weak branches that could fall on your home
Consult a landscaping company about the health of your trees
wThink aheadhen buildingor remodeling
There's no better time to prepare your home for a tornado than when you are remodeling or building a new one. Going that extra mile now could have significant benefits later.
Install impact-resistant window systems
Make certain your doors have at least three hinges and a dead bolt security lock with a bolt at least 1 inch long
Because sliding glass doors are more vulnerable to wind damage, consider installing impact-resistant door systems made of laminated glass, plastic glazing or a combination of plastic and glass
Because garage doors are highly susceptible to wind damage, install permanent wood or metal stiffeners, or contact the door manufacturer's technical staff for information on temporary supports you can attach and remove easily when severe weather threatens
When replacing your roof, take steps to ensure that both the new roof covering and the sheathing it attaches to will resist high winds. Your roofing contractor should:
Remove old coverings down to the bare wood
Remove enough sheathing to confirm that rafters and trusses are securely connected to the walls
Replace damaged sheathing
Install a roof covering designed to resist high winds
Act quickly, but don't panic
You can improve the odds of your home surviving high winds by taking these precautions, but you can't make it tornado-proof. While these measures won't guarantee the safety of your family and you, they can help keep the odds in your favor:
Move anything in your yard that may become flying debris inside your house or garage before a storm strikes. Do this only if authorities have announced a tornado watch. If authorities have announced a tornado warning, leave it all alone.
Don't open your windows. You won't save the house, as once thought, and you may actually make things worse by giving wind and rain a chance to get inside.
Don't try to ride out a tornado in a manufactured home.
If your home has a storm cellar or in-residence "safe" room, go there immediately. If your home has none and you have no time to get to a community shelter, head to the centermost part of your basement or home − away from windows and preferably under something sturdy like a workbench or staircase. The more walls between you and the outside, the better.
Turn off all utilities.
If you happen to be in your vehicle when a tornado hits, get out and try to find shelter inside a sturdy building. A ditch can provide shelter if nothing else is near.  Don't take shelter under a bridge or overpass because these could be destroyed.
