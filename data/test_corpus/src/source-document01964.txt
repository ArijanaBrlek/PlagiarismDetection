Dwayne L. Bachelors Degree, Homeland Security
  AMU was among the first to offer a homeland security degree   well before 9/11. Today, it is one of the nations largest programs.Many adult learners have tremendous responsibilities. However, American Military University (AMU) student Dwayne L. seems to bear more than most  and is proud to do so. He is a technician for a federal government agency  tasked with guarding against enemy attacks.
In five years, Ive traveled to 48 states and 12 countries, says Dwayne.  He has covered international economic summits, United Nations meetings and the Republican and Democratic National Conventions.
In order to maintain this pace, you must be mentally tough, he says. Dwayne takes physical fitness and shooting qualification tests monthly.He works nearly 60 hours a week  and never knows his schedule until noon the day before. His workday may include conducting vulnerability assessments for an overseas presidential trip, devising domestic security plans or spending many hours on a rooftop. It might be 80 degrees one day and 8 degrees the next  in a different country.
Despite his demanding career, Dwayne is taking courses at AMU toward his homeland security degree, with a 3.9 GPA. He is also a husband and father of three.I transferred to AMU because it offered a degree program that is very rare, he says.
Dwayne also values AMUs flexibility, like its eight-week courses. The courses are intense, but allow students to accelerate their degree paths and schedule classes around upcoming commitments. He has even convinced three colleagues so far to enroll at AMU.
He especially values the practical knowledge he is gaining. For one emergency and disaster management class, he is helping his hometown become storm ready.  Dwayne is working with local emergency planners to devise a warning system that integrates with federal procedures and the citys resources.Being a citizen is about being an active participant, not just a bystander, he says.
Dwayne attributes much of his drive to his parents and grandparents. He is proud to be the first in his family to pursue a college degree. His military background  he served four years in the U.S. Marine Corps -- and his time on the counter-sniper team have helped him develop tremendous focus.
His plans after graduation include working as a consultant or owning his own company.
Right now, Im building a foundation for my future, he says. After I graduate, I will always be proud to say that I passed through the ranks at AMU.
