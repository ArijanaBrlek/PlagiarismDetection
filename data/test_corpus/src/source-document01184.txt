Weight Management Information and Ideas
Exercise and Diabetes
According to the National Diabetes Clearinghouse (), it is very important for individuals with diabetes get at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. This physical activity allows diabetics to maintain a healthy weight, and help their body better use insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. www.diabetes.niddk.nih.gov
Before beginning any type of exercise program, diabetics should meet with their physician. The doctor can recommend what exercises would be safe and any special restrictions the patient should follow.
After speaking with a doctor, diabetics should consider the following additional guidelines:
If you havenâ€™t eaten for over an hour, or if your blood glucose is low (less than 100-120), have a snack before exercising.
Carry glucose tablets or a carbohydrate snack with you.
Carry an ID tag or card with you explaining that you have diabetes in case of an emergency.
If you use insulin, avoid activity when blood glucose is high (Over 240).
If you use insulin, avoid exercise before bed; blood glucose levels could drop drastically while you sleep resulting in hypoglycemia.
Pay attention to your foot health. High blood glucose levels can result in nerve damage and poor circulation to your feet. You could develop a while exercising blister and not know it, furthering its severity.
