The or was an experimental satellite communications project launched in in 1975, designed jointly by and the (ISRO). The project made available informational television programmes to rural India. The main objectives of the experiment were to educate the poor people of India on various issues via satellite broadcasting, and also to help India gain technical experience in the field of satellite communications.Satellite Instructional Television ExperimentSITE India NASA Indian Space Research Organization
The experiment ran for one year from to , covering more than 2500 villages in six . The television programmes were produced by and broadcast by NASA's satellite stationed above India for the duration of the project. The project was supported by various international agencies such as the , , and . The experiment was successful, as it played a major role in helping develop India's own satellite program, . The project showed that India could use advanced technology to fulfill the socio-economic needs of the country. SITE was followed by similar experiments in various countries, which showed the important role satellite TV could play in providing education. 1 August 1975 31 July 1976 Indian states All India Radio ATS-6 UNDP UNESCO UNICEF ITU INSAT [1]

[] edit Background
The ATS-6 satellite that was used for SITE
As part of its program in the 1960s, NASA sought to field test the direct broadcast of television programs to receivers via satellite and shortlisted India, and the as potential sites to stage the test. The country which would receive these broadcasts would have to be large enough and also close to the equator for testing a direct-broadcast satellite. While the communist regime of China was not recognised at the time by the U.S., Brazil was also ruled out as its population was concentrated in the cities, affecting the outreach of the broadcast across the country. As a consequence, India emerged as the only suitable candidate; however, its strained relationship with the U.S. prevented the U.S. government from directly asking for its assistance, preferring India to make the first request for assistance for its own .

At the same time, India was trying to launch its national space program under the leadership of . India was interested in the role of satellites for the purpose of communication and asked UNESCO to undertake a feasibility study for a project in that field. Between and , sent an expert mission to India to prepare a report on a pilot project in the use of satellite communication. The expert panel concluded that the such a project would be feasible. Following the report, a study team of three engineers from India visited USA and in June 1967, and came to the conclusion that India could meet the technical requirements for the project. Following this, the Indian government set up the National Satellite Communications Group (NASCOM) in 1968 to look into the possible uses of a synchronous communications satellite for India. This group consisted of representatives from various cabinet ministries, ISRO and (AIR). The group recommended that India should use the satellite  a second generation satellite developed by NASA  for an experiment in educational television.

, then NASA's director of international programs, arranged to have the Vikram Sarabhai approach NASA for help. Sarabhai saw this as a great opportunity for India to expand its space program and to train Indian scientists and engineers. Consequently, the and NASA signed an agreement regarding SITE in .

[] edit Objectives
As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two countries, the objectives of the project were divided into two partsgeneral objectives and specific objectives. The general objectives of the project were to:
gain experience in the development, testing and management of a satellite-based instructional television system particularly in rural areas and to determine optimal system parameters;
demonstrate the potential value of satellite technology in the rapid development of effective mass communications in developing countries;
demonstrate the potential value of satellite broadcast TV in the practical instruction of village inhabitants; and
stimulate national development in India, with important managerial, economic, technological and social implications.
The primary general objectives from an Indian perspective were to educate the populace about issues related to family planning, agricultural practices and national integration. The secondary objectives were to impart general school and adult education, train teachers, improve other occupational skills and to improve general health and hygiene through the medium of satellite broadcasts. Besides these social objectives, India also wanted to gain experience in all the technical aspects of the system, including broadcast and reception facilities and TV program material.
The primary US objective was to test the design and functioning of an efficient, medium-power, wide bandspace-borne FM transmitter, operating in the 800900  band and gain experience on the utilisation of this space application. MHz [4]
[] edit International collaboration
A joint ISRO-NASA working group was established even before the Memorandum of Understanding was signed. This working group studied the possibility of using a communications satellite for TV broadcast in India. After the MoU was signed, many review meetings were held between NASA and ISRO scientists. Indian scientists visited NASA to study front-end converters and earth station operations. On India's request, the organisation agreed to provide free satellite time for pre-SITE testing. INTELSAT
The (UNDP) provided assistance of $500,000 for setting up the Experimental Satellite Communications Earth Station (ESCES) at and nominated the (ITU) as the executing agency for this project. The UNDP provided another $1.5 million, for setting up a TV studio at Ahmedabad and a TV transmitter at Pij in . It also gave assistance for setting up a TV Training Institute to train many of the programme production staff who would join to work on SITE. was the executing agency for this project. contributed to SITE by sponsoring 21 film modules produced by , a noted Indian film-maker.

[] edit Technical details
ATS-F coverage of India at 860 MHz
The production of the television programmes was decentralised, with three Base Production Centres located at , and , and an ISRO studio located in . Each of the centres had a production studio, three tape recorders, two 16 mm. projectors, a slide Projector in and audio equipment like tape desks and turntables. Each centre also had 23 full fledged synchronised sound camera units, an editing table (Delhi had two) and a film processing plant. There was also a sound dubbing studio equipped with a pilot tone recording plant and an audio mixing console. Delhi Cuttack Hyderabad Mumbai IVC Telecine [6]
The television programmes prepared by the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at 6  to ATS 6 from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad. These signals were then re-transmitted at 860 MHz by the satellite, which were directly received in 2000 villages by community television receivers with 3  . Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another 3000 villages in the standard television band. Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster. This setup was called the Direct Reception System (DRS). Apart from the direct broadcasts, the earth station at Ahmedabad was micro-wave linked to the TV transmitter built in the village of Pij. The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR. A receive-only station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter. GHz m parabolic antennas VHF [7] [8]
The DRS undertook terrestrial broadcasting for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, it did not provide for small towns where the TV set density was higher than in the villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a limited (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5 m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a , that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, in (75 villages) and in (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at . low-power rebroadcast low-noise block converter Sambalpur Orissa Muzaffarpur Bihar SHAR, Sriharikota [9]
[] edit Village selection
As the broadcasting time was limited, it was decided that the direct reception receivers would only be installed in 2400 villages in six regions spread across the country. Technical and social criteria were used to select suitable areas to conduct this experiment. A computer program was specially designed at ISRO to help make this selection. As one of the aims of the experiment was to study the potential of TV as a medium of development, the villages were chosen specifically for their backwardness. According to the 1971 , the states having the most number of backward districts in the country were , , , , , , and . Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were eventually left out, as they were slated to get terrestrial television by the time SITE would end. SITE was launched in twenty districts spread across the other six states. Each of the states thus selected was called a "cluster". In each cluster, 34 districts, each containing around 1000 villages, were identified. Finally, around 400 villages were chosen in each cluster. Close to 80% villages selected for SITE did not have electricity in the buildings where the SITE TV sets would be installed. A special project called Operation Electricity was launched to urgently electrify the villages before the start of SITE. 150 villages would have television sets running on solar cells and batteries. These sets were specially designed by Indian engineers with help from NASA. [10] census of India Orissa Bihar Andhra Pradesh Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh West Bengal Karnataka [10] [11] [2]
