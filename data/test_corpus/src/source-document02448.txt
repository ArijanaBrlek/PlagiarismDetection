Managing Diversity In The Workplace
Managing Diversity In The Workplace
Part of managing diversity in the workplace is making sure all employees, regardless of race, gender, cultural background, religion, age, physical ability, financial status, social class or employment level, feel recognized and valued as an important member of the team. This is not always an easy feat. Some do not realize they are being discriminatory towards others.
Sometimes, it is taken for granted that certain types of jokes, comments or even flirtation is acceptable. Little excuses are made for some of this behavior and when it is allowed to go on, the negative remarks and actions grow bolder. Your employees may suffer from much more than hurt feelings. The extreme is that violent actions can be taken in retaliation after the tension has built up to the point where the abuse cannot be tolerated anymore.
This is not the norm, however. Usually, negative tension caused by diversity problems create a low morale in the workplace, which leads to poor productivity, a high turnover rate among employees, and a loss of profits for the company. What's the answer to this problem? Diversity training is a great place to start.
