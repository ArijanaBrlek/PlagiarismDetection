Robusta coffees, traded in London at much lower prices than New York's arabica, are preferred by large industrial clients, such as multinational roasters and instant coffee producers because of the lower cost.

The concept of labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a negotiated preharvest price, began with the labeling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons (of 7,050,000 produced worldwide) were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34% to 0.51%. A number of studies have shown that fair trade coffee has a positive impact on the communities that grow it. A study in 2002 found that fair trade strengthened producer organizations, improved returns to small producers, and positively affected their . A 2003 study concluded that fair trade has "greatly improved the well-being of small-scale coffee farmers and their families" by providing access to credit and external development funding and greater access to training, giving them the ability to improve the quality of their coffee. The families of fair trade producers were also more stable than those who were not involved in fair trade, and their children had better access to education. A 2005 study of Bolivian coffee producers concluded that has had a positive impact on local coffee prices, economically benefiting all coffee producers, fair trade-certified or not. fair trade Max Havelaar Foundation's [36] [37] quality of life [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] fair trade certification [43]
The production and consumption of fair trade coffee has grown in recent years as some local and national coffee chains have started to offer fair trade alternatives. [44]

Processing

Roasted coffee beans.
Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. First, coffee berries are picked, generally by hand. Then they are sorted by ripeness and color and the of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds usually called beans are fermented to remove the slimy layer of still present on the bean. When the is finished, the beans are washed with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of highly polluted . Finally, the seeds are dried, sorted, and labeled as green coffee beans. A traditional way to let the coffee beans dry is to let them sit on a cement patio and rake over the beans till dry. Although some companies just use cylinders to pump in heated air and that will dry off the coffee beans. flesh mucilage fermentation coffee wastewater [46]
The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold by the supplier, or it can be . The roasting influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging. The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches 200 , though different varieties of beans differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, occurs as intense heat breaks down in the bean, changing them to that begin to brown, changing the color of the bean. Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils, acids, and caffeine weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 C, other oils start to develop. One of these oils is , created at about 200 C, which is largely responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor. roasted home roasted [47] process C [48] caramelization starches simple sugars [49] [48] caffeol [17]
Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted beans illuminated with a light source in the near spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee s relative degree of roast or flavor development. Such devices are routinely used for quality assurance by coffee-roasting businesses. infrared spectroscopy
Darker roasts are generally smoother, because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have more caffeine, resulting in a slight bitterness, and a stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the bean after processing. Chaff is usually removed from the beans by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils on the beans. may also be part of the processing that coffee seeds undergo. Seeds are decaffeinated when they are still green. Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either soaking beans in hot water or steaming them, then using a to dissolve caffeine-containing oils. Decaffeination is often done by processing companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry. [50] [51] [48] Decaffeination solvent [17] [17]
Storage
Once roasted, coffee beans must be stored properly to preserve the fresh taste of the bean. Ideally, the container must be airtight and kept cool. In order of importance, air, moisture, heat, and light are the environmental factors responsible for deteriorating flavor in coffee beans. [52]
Folded-over bags, a common way consumers often purchase coffee, are generally not ideal for long-term storage because they allow air to enter. A better package contains a one-way valve, which prevents air from entering. [52]

Coffee beans must be ground and in order to create a beverage. Grinding the roasted coffee beans is done at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in the home. They are most commonly ground at a roastery and then packaged and sold to the consumer, though "whole bean" coffee can be ground at home. Coffee beans may be ground in several ways. A uses revolving elements to shear the bean; an electric grinder smashes the beans with blunt blades moving at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crushes the beans. brewed burr mill
The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used. is the finest grind, while or are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between the extremes; a medium grind is used in most common home coffee brewing machines. Turkish grind coffee percolator French press [53]
Coffee may be brewed by several methods: boiled, steeped, or pressured. Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and is an example of this method. It is prepared by powdering the beans with a , then adding the powder to water and bringing it to a boil in a pot called a or, in Greek, a briki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface. Turkish coffee [54] mortar and pestle cezve [54]
Machines such as or brew coffee by gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds held in a made of paper or perforated metal, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while absorbing its oils and essences. Gravity causes the liquid to pass into a carafe or pot while the used are retained in the filter. In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then passes downward through the grounds due to gravity, repeating the process until shut off by an internal timer or, more commonly, a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature. This thermostat also serves to keep the coffee warm (it turns on when the pot cools), but requires the removal of the basket holding the grounds after the initial brewing to avoid additional brewing as the pot reheats. Purists do not feel that this repeated boiling is conducive to achieving the best-flavoured coffee. percolators automatic coffeemakers coffee filter coffee grounds [55] [55]
Coffee may also be brewed by steeping in a device such as a (also known as a or coffee press). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a coffee press and left to brew for a few minutes. A plunger is then depressed to separate the coffee grounds, which remain at the bottom of the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the beverage, making it stronger and leaving more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine.

The method forces hot (but not boiling) pressurized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9 10 ), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the amount of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called that floats on the surface. The drink "" is popularly thought to have been named after American soldiers in who found the European way of drinking espresso too strong; baristas would cut the espresso with hot water for them. espresso atm crema [53] Americano WW II

Espresso-based coffee has a wide variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, it is served alone as a "shot" or in the more watered-down style a shot or two of espresso with hot water. The Americano should be served with the espresso shots on top of the hot water to preserve the crema. Milk can be added in various forms to espresso: steamed milk makes a , equal parts espresso and milk froth make a , and a dollop of hot foamed on top creates a .
