The One Ton model was launched in September 1968 as an uprated version of the (3/4 ton) 109" Long Wheelbase Series IIa Land Rover. The vehicle was specified with the 2.6 litre six cylinder petrol engine, and the gearbox from the IIb forward control. The axles were heavy-duty ENV units (also used on the 101 FC). From around 1972, the Series III One Ton models had front and rear Salisbury axles, and later still the front diff became the standard Rover unit. The chassis was an upgraded reinforced item, featuring drop shackle suspension as pioneered on military vehicles. The 9.00x16 tyres on deep dish rims were carried over from the IIb forward control. Longer brake pipes were fitted as well as a brake servo, the front brakes being wider than standard with 3" shoes. Production got underway properly in April 1969 when vehicle number two was built, and all these vehicles had the headlamps in the wings, in line with standard IIa vehicles from that period. When production moved on to the series III in September 1971, 170 One Ton Series IIa vehicles had been built. Production of the Series III One Tons is thought to stand at around 235 vehicles. The TACR I airfield fire truck was based on One Ton specs. The 'One Ton' Land Rover and 'One Tonne' Land Rover are very different vehicles, the 'one tonne' being the 101 FC.
