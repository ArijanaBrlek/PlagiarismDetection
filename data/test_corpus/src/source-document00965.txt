Can you believe that most of the 13 million people who enter Disneyland pass through the front gate and down Main Street Disneyland each year? That's a lot of pavement pounding.  Main Street is where the train departs for a tour around the park, horse drawn carts offer a trip down the Main strip and dozens of shops sell everything from candy and clothes to blown and cut glass items, cameras and even watches.  It is also where you'll find lockers to keep your belongings in and customer relations. 
When you walk down the middle of the street, you are likely to get beeped by one of the vehicles passing by.
