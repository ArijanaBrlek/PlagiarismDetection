Grimstad Named MHP Colonel
HELENA -- Attorney General Mike McGrath Tuesday introduced Paul Grimstad as the new colonel and chief administrator of the Montana Highway Patrol.
"Paul's education and experience make him the right person to lead the Patrol at this time," McGrath said. "The Patrol will face some significant challenges in the next few years, including changing technology and the need for an expanded officer corps.
"Col. Grimstad, as part of the new generation of leadership in the Highway Patrol, has the vision and skills to face those challenges," McGrath said.
Grimstad, 46, will mark 21 years with the Patrol this fall. He graduated from the MHP academy in 1981 and began work in September 1983, in Wolf Point, then Great Falls. Grimstad was stationed in Missoula for 18 years prior to his promotion to captain of the Bozeman District. He became the Patrol's administrative captain, based in Helena, in the last year.
Grimstad replaces Col. Randall Yaeger. Yaeger retired this month after 20 years with the MHP. He will pursue a career in aviation.
"I wish Randy the best," McGrath said. "He's been a committed, dedicated member of the Patrol and we're grateful for his service."
Grimstad was born in Sidney and raised in Billings. In 1982, he graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in education. Grimstad's salary in his new position will be $76,700 annually. A formal promotion and swearing-in ceremony will be later this summer.
The Montana Highway Patrol is the state's largest law enforcement agency, with about 200 sworn officers and 70 civilian employees.
