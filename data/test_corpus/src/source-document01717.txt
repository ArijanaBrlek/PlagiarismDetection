Neil Young and Crazy Horse
Years of the Horse - Tales of the 3rd Best Garage Band in the World
Neil Young News
Bill Graham once called Crazy Horse the 3rd Best Garage Band in the World. That was back in the 80's and it's unclear whether that rank has gone up or down since then. Irregardless, it hardly matters to Neil Young and Crazy Horse where they rate.
, Neil Young's producer/arranger on the masterpiece "Broken Arrow", has stated that Crazy Horse was the American equivalent of The Rolling Stones. IMHO, Crazy Horse is to Neil Young what . As perfect a complement as tequila and salt. Jack Nitzsche The Band was to Bob Dylan
As they say in Prisoner's of Rock-n-Roll, "they don't want to be good". Smell the Horse!
From a Billy Talbot interview in Martin Jones Australia's from 11/19/03: BigPond
"I think to play Greendale, it's a much tastier piece of music than we've done in a while. We kind of like feel that when we first started playing and we were playing 'Down By The River' and 'Cinnamon Girl' and stuff like that from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, when we were first out there, we used to play with the same kind of touch, a similar kind of touch that's in Greendale. So we feel really fortunate that we were able to come up with that kind of stuff again."
"'There wasn't a concept when we started,' Talbot recalls the birth of the narrative-based Greendale album. 'There was the driven idea that we wanted to re-invent ourselves so to speak. That was something that we talked about a little bit; that we're a great band and we need to revitalise, we need something really good and juicy. And we didn't know what that was but Neil had a song and we started playing it and the next time there was a new song that he hadn't showed us yet and that was the first song on Greendale. And we didn't know what it was going to be and we got it down on tape and it just started going from there. And the next time he came in with a song, it had some of the characters in it from the song before. He didn't know he was going to do that, he was just following his nose, the muse, and that's how it started happening. Before long, after about three songs, we started to realise what was going on here. But he never tried to think it out, he let it happen.' "
"'I'm sure it's just like a, you know, a fine carpenter who builds something and knows it's good and other people appreciate it,' says Talbot. 'It's that kind of satisfaction I would prefer to call it than pride. But pride is a good word as well, you can take pride in it. I feel more satisfied that we've finally got to a point where I feel like the band has finally gotten to a point where we're really rocking. And when we play, after we do the whole Greendale show and it comes to a finale, when we come back out and do the old classics, well some of them aren't that old and some of them are really old, it's just such a setup, it's just so great and the audience loves it and 'cause that's what Greendale does for us.' "
From November 2003 interview with Undercover's Paul Cashmere on Crazy Horse's on the Archives: Frank 'Poncho' Sampedro
"You know, I think Neil (and he would never say it) just has a feeling that putting out a boxed set like that is kind of like marking the end of your career and it is like a tribute to yourself. He would never say that but he just doesn't want to do that until he is done. That is what I feel. He has never said that to me. There is too much time to spend making new music than focusing on all your old stuff. "
Poncho commenting on Neil and Crazy Horse's musical talent:
"It's a funny thing and I hate to say anything about Neil but I think all of us are not great, great musicians but as a whole when we play with each other we play better than what we can play individually. We have a certain kind of chemistry and energy when we come together. People say our songs are so simple, two chords or four chords or whatever but we don't know that much about music. When we play it is like the first time we have ever played and we put it into our heart. We just can't stop ourselves from becoming that. It just becomes big when everybody does that and has the same feeling a certain amount of energy gets out there that is hard to look away from."
Asked about how he felt replacing Danny Whitten as the Crazy Horse lead guitar:
"I never felt I could replace Danny and to this day I can't play like Danny. Every once in a while Neil will say "you should listen to the record" or Billy will say "just listen to what Danny did". I try not to. Danny had what he did and I think it is very special. He was a great singer and a great songwriter and he played guitar a certain way. That's just not what I do. I play the way I play. I remember when I first met Neil. 'On The Beach' had just come out. It had 'Turnstile Blues', 'Vampire Blues' and I remember telling Neil (and I don't know how I had the balls to say it) but I said "you know, you've got a lot of blues on your record. You should be rockin' and having fun and seeing chick's asses swaying in the audience" (laughs). So that is the kind of approach I brought."
