Objective
The objective of this test is to monitor the development of the athlete's lower back and hamstring flexibility.
Required Resources
To undertake this test you will require:
A 'sit & reach table' or a bench with a ruler
An assistant
How to conduct the test
The Sit and Reach Test is conducted as follows:
The starting position is sitting on the floor with shoes removed, feet flat against the table, and legs straight
Reach forward and push the fingers along the table as far as possible
The distance from the finger tips to the edge of the table represents the score for that person
As the 'sit and reach' table has an overhang of 15 cm, a person who reaches 10 cm past their toes scores 25 cm
It is important to have several warm-up attempts first, and to record the best score
Analysis
Analysis of the result is by comparing it with the results of previous tests. It is expected that, with appropriate training between each test, the analysis would indicate an improvement.
