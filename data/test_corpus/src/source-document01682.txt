Hello. We’d better explain what’s going on with our website. You see, we were called a digital agency, but we think the days of the digital agency are kinda numbered. We also think that about some ad agencies, but that’s a story for another day.
We’re changing into a different type of company. The thinking has been going on for a long time, but the actual transformation process starts here, today. And, in the spirit of what we believe, we’re going to share each and every step of that process in the hope that we’ll get people interested in the debate, receive comments, ideas, criticisms and abuse, all of which will be essential to forming our vision of where we’re headed.
So that’s why our old site is no longer here (though we’ve kept some of our recent work up for you to browse).
We believe that digital is a channel. It’s a great channel. But it’s not a discipline. We believe that the boundaries between products, services and marketing are blurring at a faster and faster rate, and that the future of brands lie in the conception and design of lovely, satisfying, human experiences.
Our clients’ products are no longer the physical objects that you hand over your hard-earned cash for. The experience is the product and the product is the experience. Our discipline must be great ideas that transcend media and technology.
Because as media channels fragment, it is all the more important that the brand experience becomes more focused, and that there is a consistent narrative and tone of interaction. We have to simply create great ideas that make people’s lives better.
This is where we want to be headed, and we want to bring like minded people together to help make this a reality. Over the next 3 months till our relaunch we’ll be detailing our thoughts, ideas and the development of our methodologies for experience planning and experience design. And we’ll post it all up here day by day. We’ll also throw up some behind the scenes insights to our current projects, and expain how we’re applying experience design to them.
We’d really like you to tell us what you think. If you like we’d love to meet up and chat about it, and have some tea and mince pies. That would be a nice experience.
We’re completely open minded. More than likely our main focus in the short term will be digital. After all, it’s currently one of the most interesting games in town. But we can’t and won’t restrict ourselves, because an experience is a journey - and the very best journeys are the ones where you visit a few different places along the way.
Who knows, in 5 years perhaps we’ll all be designing toys. And that would be fun.really
More really soon.
