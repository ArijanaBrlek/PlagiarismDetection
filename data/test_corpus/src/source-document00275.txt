Ive heard the IRS honors a tax deduction that has to do with my vehicle registration fees. Is this true?
Yes. The scoop is that the IRS counts a vehicle registration fee that's based on your vehicle's value as a personal property tax, which is deductible. This is true even if your state calls the fee a "registration fee" or a "vehicle use fee." Check out page 146 of the IRS's for more details. Publication 17
But before you start entering your registration fees on line 7 of the 1040A form, double check to make sure your state calculates the car registration fee based on the car's value. For example, if your state charges you 1% of the car's value each year as a vehicle fee, and you pay $100 based on your car's value ($10,000), then you can deduct $100. If your state charges you for 1% of the car's value, plus a bunch of other miscellaneous fees, then you can still only deduct the $100. The fees might be itemized on your vehicle registration card or registration renewal form.
Other states ignore the car's value and charge only based on the vehicle weight; in those cases, you can't take the deduction.
If you aren't sure about whether the state charges this fee or you can't find the fee, contact your local motor-vehicle office. If you have questions about taking the deduction, call a tax professional or the IRS.
