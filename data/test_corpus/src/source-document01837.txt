About the AVP
The AVP was established in 1983 and is comprised of the best men’s and women’s pro beach volleyball players in the U.S. and arguably, the world. The AVP’s main goal is to deliver its fans the experience of an amazing athletic contest surrounded by an unforgettable beach party. More than one million people are expected to attend an AVP event this year. On May 31, 2001 the AVP was reorganized with a new management team led by agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. When they announced the acquisition of the tour in Manhattan Beach, Calif. they made a historic move by uniting both men and women professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization. With this historic unification of the men’s and women’s competitions, the “new” AVP Tour has been able to capitalize on having one property that could maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money. The AVP now stands alone as the only pro beach volleyball tour in the country and has a cooperative relationship with USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB).
