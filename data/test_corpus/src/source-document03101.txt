Every New Yearâ€™s Eve I get together with friends to celebrate. We mark the occasion by taking time to reflect on the past year with gratitude, and setting intentions for the New Year. Last year we had a lively discussion about having an A plan and a B plan. The A plan in our circle had to do with creativity and the B plan security.
Imagine my surprise to see that newly unemployed bankers have a B plan: Creativity!

With Wall Street hemorrhaging jobs, bonuses disappearing and the financial sector going through a seismic shift, some bankers and lawyers are switching lanes to more creative career paths. They are putting down their Wall Street Journals and picking up Variety as they try their hands at comedy, filmmaking and writing.
Harry B. Weiner, a partner at On-Ramps, a recruiting and consulting firm that works with financial professionals, says the economic downturn is creating a new psychology of career transition.
People feel theres nothing to lose in terms of taking a risk and pursuing a new direction, especially when you have a r sum that says banking and no banks are hiring, Mr. Weiner said.
That was certainly the calculus for Benjamin Cox, 33. After leaving his job as a vice president atin August, he immediately began incubating his plans to work on his screenplay  he calls it a cross between Swingers and Annie Hall  and start a production company.Goldman Sachs
Mr. Cox said that with the upheaval on Wall Street, he feels relieved to have a backup plan. Im seeing a lot of people who never thought of an alternative to banking.
Richard Florida, author of ? and director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, sees the gravitational pull away from Wall Street and toward more creative industries as part of a necessary economic recalibration.
