Halloween:
There are many ways to tie in holidays to the bachelor party theme. It is fun to see just how creative everyone gets. - Supporting our troops is important and nothing says it better than to dress up in military garb. You can go to your local military surplus store and find all types of cool outfits to put together. It is also great to have a fund for raising money for our troops families by donating to the American Red Cross who has a program. Make sure to tell them you want it going to the military family support programs. It is nice to give when we can all have the freedom to do this. - Nothing attracts attention finer than the good ole religious figures. Have the bachelor dress like the high priestess/or rabbi while the others are his disciples giving him guidance. You are sure to have a great time and get loads of laughs! Make sure to bless the women you meet and have a great time. There is nothing better than a religious figure partying and dancing. - A fun and crazy idea is to have all the groomsmen dress up in superhero outfits and save the town. You will make everyone's day when they see Aquaman, Superman, and the rest of the superheroes enter a bar or nightclub. You will make Metropolis safe as well as have an excellent time. If not all groomsmen and guests are into the idea, at least dress the bachelor in a superman outfit or other superhero.

Have all the guys either as devils or Dracula's at the party. It is most customary to make the bachelor the head devil with cool horns and a pitchfork which you can find in any costume store. You can also have all the bachelors wear black and get into the dark/gothic theme. Everyone will be sure to have a fun time preying on the patrons at the bars or restaurants.

The important thing is to ask the groom-to-be what type of party he is willing to have as you don't want her uncomfortable at his own party! Give enough time for those going to the bachelor party to be creative and come up with the chosen theme costuming. It is also okay to have one organizer give places where things can be purchased to make it easier on the guys, especially if everyone is in school or working and don't have a lot of time.
