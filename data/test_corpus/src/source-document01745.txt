Primary types of auctions
: This is the type of auction commonly used by the English auction houses like , , and . Participants bid openly against one another, with each bid being higher than the previous bid. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, or when a pre-determined "buy-out" price is reached, at which point the highest bidder pays the price. The seller may set a 'reserve' price and if the auction fails to have a bid equal to or higher than the reserve, the item remains unsold. A variant popular in the time of was 'auction by candle' in which the winning (highest) bid was the last one to be made before a small piece of lit candle died out. Such auctions can be vulnerable to collusion, when two or more bidders act together to win the auction. Following the auction result, the "loser" threatens to sue the winner, who then proposes a settlement. The settlement is actually the pre-agreed reward for the loser's cooperation. This strategy was described by the economist . English auction Sotheby's Christie's Phillips Samuel Pepys [2] Susan Athey
Within this type of auction, there are several manners in which bidding can occur. First, is the absolute auction, which means that the item will be sold for the highest possible price, with no reserve. Second, is a reserve auction, which establishes a minimum bid or price for the item that will be accepted by the person who is selling the item. Third, you have Absentee bidding, which means that a bid is left with the auctioneer. Fourth, is internet bidding, where the bidding can be online and at the auction house at the same time. Fifth is Phone bids, which is nearly identical as absentee bidding, but an auction house employee does the bidding for the buyer. And last but not least is the sealed bidding process.

, also known as an Unreserved Auction, No-reserve Auction or Auction Without Reserve, is an auction with no minimum bid amount, no set starting bid, no seller confirmation of the high bid price, and no buybacks of the property being offered by the seller of any agents of the seller. The highest bidder will purchase the property no matter the high bid price. This type of auction is designed to attract the maximum participation from the buying public as the seller has committed to convey their property to the highest bidder without limitation. It does offer buyers excellent opportunities from time to time, however. A 2003 Virginia statute defines an absolute auction as "an auction where at the time of the auction sale the real or personal property to be sold will pass to the highest bidder regardless of the amount of the highest and last bid."

If more than one identical item is sold, there are two possible generalizations of the second-price auction. In a uniform-price auction, all of the winning bidders pay the price submitted by the highest non-winning bidder. Bidders will not typically bid their true value in a uniform-price auction with multiple units. In a Vickrey (or second-price sealed-bid) auction, the pricing rule is more complicated, but preserves the property that bidders will bid their true valuation. It is also possible to auction each identical item individually. Once each item has been priced, the winning bidder is entitled to buy the remaining goods at the same price. Items the winning bidder opts not to purchase are auctioned again. This system creates a tension between the desire to hold back on bidding since later items will almost certainly be cheaper, and the chance that by losing the first round of bidding all possibility of purchasing will be lost.
