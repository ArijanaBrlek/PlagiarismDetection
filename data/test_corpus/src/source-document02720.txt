Fan Fiction
I was going to fill this section with my feeble attempts at fan fiction, but I realized that I am actually quite unfit to present any literary works fit for public consumption. Fortunately for you all, one of the most prolific authors Ive ever come across actually agreed to let me host some fanfics on this site of mine. I never thought Id host someone elses works, but this authors stories are of the rare sort that have grammar and spelling and punctuation can produce this nice crawly feeling down the back of my spine, so I caved. Quite gladly, I might add.Inuyashaand
Submissions to this section are suspended until I can figure out how much webspace I can spare for fan fics. I sincerely apologize to those whose fics I had to turn down, but the site was never intended as a fan fiction archive, and I really cannot afford to pay for more webspace. So for now, the only updates expected for this section are continuations to stories already archived here, and/or new stories from the featured authors. The older/original fanfic submissions are at the top, the newer ones at the bottom.Update:
