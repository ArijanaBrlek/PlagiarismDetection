Pesticides & Preventatives Poisoning Pets?
Written by Jan onJanuary 8, 2009 – 3:14 pm
As most of you know, I have for years been sounding the warning siren about the slow poisoning of dogs from pesticides, co-called “preventatives” and other toxic chemicals. If your e-mails are any indication, many of you are listening. But many of you arent. Veterinary waiting rooms continue to be filled with accidentally poisoned pets. Some of these pets dont survive.
Okay, Ive said it before and Ill say it again: Pesticides are proven to increase your dogs (or cats) chance of getting cancer. A University of Pennsylvania vet school46% of dogs and 39% of cats dying of disease will die of cancer. study showed topical insecticides (aka preventatives) significantly increased bladder cancer risk, especially in overweight dogs. Other studies have shown cancer risks from herbicides. Some products meant for pets can even increase the chance and your children will become ill.you
Snail, ant and rodent baits may also prove deadly, sometimes killing quickly, sometimes slowly. Dont think it cant happen to your pet. In the poison free yard of my favorite pet safety advocate (me!), both of my dogs were exposed to rat poison. I immediately induced vomiting, got advice from ASPCAs Poison Control Center, took them to the emergency room visit followed by weeks of Vitamin K supplementation yet my dog Jiggys liver enzymes rose off the charts. Now, nine months later, an incompetent exterminator has lost his job and Jiggy still shows impaired liver function. Jiggys vet bills top $3000 with no end in sight.
Even when we dont realize it, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and other poisons assault our dogs bodies in countless ways:
We apply insecticides to kill fleas and tickspurposefully. Surely, none of us would rub poison between our childrens shoulder blades, or bathe them in poisons, but when it comes to pets, we trustingly accept the wisdom of advertisers and flea-and-tick product vendors. You can check out your Flea and Tick products for safety at . Green Paws Dont forget to check all the products your groomer or kennel owner uses, too, and have them send for a Green Paws Action Kit. And remember, even if a product is labeled natural or listed as safe, it may still be harmful to your pets long-term health. In 2008, ASPCA toxicologists reported more than 31,000 calls related to insecticides, often because of misuse of flea and tick products.
We administer insecticides orallyto kill heartworms, even when sustained cool temps make contracting heartworms all but impossible (according to the University of Pennsylvania and other experts). Yet, advertisers tell us to buy these products year round. Its about money, honey.
Pets unknowingly auto-apply pesticides, herbicides, and other toxins during walks with you. Even if your own yard is free of toxic chemicals, romps on golf courses, common areas and dog parks, with their unknown pesticide and herbicide products and treatment schedules, can prove deadly. Whatever gets on your pets feet is licked into their bodies, assaulting livers and increasing carcinogenic loads.
tells me there is no upper limit for pesticide contamination.Pets eat hidden pesticides in their food, especially corn-laden grocery store kibble. Corn deemed unfit for human consumptionsometimes because of excessive pesticide contaminationoften ends up in pet food. Pet food expert Dr. Jean Hofve
Pets get into rodent, ant and snail poisoneven when are careful. Some of these products (like rat poison) cause death by internal bleeding and you may not recognize symptoms until its too late. Just a tiny amount of some products (like snail bait) can kill. My dogs poisoning came in an usual way: from rat bait locked inside a safe-looking bait box; a raccoonyoutrying to get at the baitbanged the box on the ground and my dogs found the scattered bait.
Pets (and hunting birds, coyotes, etc.) eat poisoned animals(rats, groundhogs, etc.) and are poisoned themselves. This happens more than you might suspect.
So heres what to do to keep your pet safe from poison. First, check all products for child safety. If theyre not safe for kids, theyre not safe for dogs and cats. Second, wash your pet’s feet after walking on any suspect area. , wipe paws with a damp cloth. Clean paws, too, after walks on grimy chemically-laden streets and salted roads. If you wouldnt lick a surface, dont let your animal lick the grime off his paws. It just takes but a moment to wash up, and could save you countless tears, wasted days and thousands of dollars at the vets office.At least

Lowering Vet Bills: 10 Tips for Keeping Costs Down
Written by Jan onDecember 11, 2008 – 11:26 am
The cost of vet care for 2008 is estimated at $10.9 billion, up almost a billion from last year. With the economy tanking, jobs disappearing and the stock market down, many of us are postponing or foregoing dog care because we can’t afford treatment. It’s time — past time! — to cut out those unnecessary products and services too many pet parents think are essential — but may actually be harmful. Here are some cost-saving ideas that will also make dogs healthier:
No more vaccinating against diseases your dog is unlikely to catch and against diseases to which your dog is already immune. Not only is unnecessary vaccination a huge waste of time and money, the resulting adverse health consequences can ruin doggy health and cost you a fortune in vet bills down the line. Watch our video for suggestions, and read or reread “Rethinking Vaccination” in our book, . Also, read our blog article on titer testing. (.) This simple blood test is especially important to prevent over-vaccinating puppies.1. STOP VACCINATING UNNECESSARILY! Vaccinating Dogs Scared Poopless Click here
Although spending more for high quality food may seem a strange way to save money, it is your absolute best shot at long-term doggy health and lower vet bills. Start feeding wisely and you may see allergies, intestinal problems, joint ouchiness and other ailments disappear. At the very least, stop feeding grocery store brands and switch from kibble to canned. Better yet, feed frozen raw or fresh cooked or raw. My book has two chapters on food, one of them you can read free by clicking .2. FEED QUALITY FOOD. here
According to Purina’s much promoted 14-year study of 48 Labrador Retrievers, “lean-fed” dogs (receiving 25% less food than their littermates) eventually developed the same health problems as littermates as they aged, but needed treatment for ailments 2.1 years later. That is, treatment began at a mean age of 12 versus age 9.9. Here’s the secret to longevity: It’s not about feeding a particular brand; it’s about feeding to a healthy, lean (not too skinny) condition. Cut out all fattening corn-laden foods. Don’t leave food out all day and don’t overfeed. Remember: fat dogs aren’t cute; they’re expensive.3. FEED LESS.
Few things are more expensive, or risky, than dental procedures. Avoid them by feeding low-carb foods (not kibble) and by brushing your dog’s teeth at least three times a week. Use a good paste meant for dogs (not Humans!) and use gauze around your finger or a super-soft toothbrush.4. BRUSH TEETH MORE OFTEN.
Check out your dogs meds (especially steroids and arthritis medications) on-line by name, and at the websites listed under on my website link page. Also, if it’s not mosquito season where you live, why are you giving heartworm meds? No skeeters … no heartworm. Fleas aren’t much of a problem during the winter in most places either. Check out my book’s chapter, “Stop Pest-ering Me!” or do research on-line to learn more about heartworm and flea life cycles and natural methods of pest control. Just make sure your research is from reliable, unbiased sources. Websites that look “scientific” may be fronts for manufacturers of pet meds. Also check out my blog post on for more information about protection.5. STOP GIVING UNNECESSARY OR DANGEROUS DRUGS. Preventing the Preventable Heartworms
if she hasn’t had one in the last year (or six months for senior dogs). Remember, dogs age faster than we do and a thorough blood test (with a chem panel) is the easiest (and sometimes the only) way to detect disease while it’s still curable and cheaper to treat. Also test yearly for heartworms, whether or not you use meds.6. GET FLUFFY A BLOOD TEST
that can perforate or lodge in tracheas and intestines: cooked bones, rawhide chews, pigs feet and other too-hard chews. Surgery for obstructions and perforations is very expensive and may come too late to save your dog’s life.7. STOP GIVING DANGEROUS TREATS
after a walk on chemically-laden surfaces like city streets and salted roads. Beware park areas which may have been recently fertilized, or treated with herbicides, without your knowing. And dont use toxic chemicals in your home or yard. If its on your dogs feet, before long it will be in your dogs mouth. If it’s in your dog’s mouth, he’s on the slippery slope toward cancer.8. WASH YOUR DOGS FEET
You’d be shocked at how much money is spent on inadvertent poisoning from snail, ant and rat bait, and also the general ailment called “Garbage Can Syndrome.” (Thanks to Pet Evironmentalist Elizabeth Allen of for her work in this area.)9.

Cancer in Dogs: Natural Ways to Prevent and Treat It (Part II)
Written by Jan onOctober 9, 2008 – 12:12 pm
When Woody, beloved dog of holistic vet Dr. Paula Terafaj, was diagnosed with cancer of the spleen and liver, she set out to help Woody battle his own cancer without toxic chemo or surgery. Her fight to help Woody resulted in a series of articles on cancer care. Even if your dog doesn’t have cancer, and I very much hope he or she doesn’t, I hope you’ll bookmark this page. 46% of dogs dying of disease now die of cancer, so this is information, sadly, many of us may someday need.
I personally am no expert on canine cancer, so I’m happy to bring you this piece by a vet. Dr. Paula also allowed me to post Part 1 of this series, first published in her own blog. Read Part 1 by clicking . We’ll publish Part 3 in a few weeks. And now, Part 2. here
Part 1 of this article introduced the importance of disease prevention and how to promote better health. This discussion continues with the emphasis on how you can assist the bodys natural healing power. We can empower our army of immune fighting soldiersboth in terms of stronger prevention tactics and a stronger battle plan to attack a stealth enemy like cancer.
Remember that a well functioning immune system is your best guarantee of health. In fact, the immune system is on guard 24/7 in what has been termed .immune surveillance
A basic summary of states that:immune surveillance
Immune surveillance performed by specialized cells in the immune system known as Natural Killer (NK) cells can recognize and destroy spontaneously arising malignant tumor cells. Tumors can develop when transformed malignant cells escape immunological host defense mechanisms. The increased incidence of spontaneous tumors in immunosuppressed individuals indicates that theimmune system can provide a major mechanism for host resistance against cancer and infectious diseases.
Now I will tell you how you can up your health insurance policy and fight back by taking nutraceuticalsfood extracts from selected plants and herbs proven to have medicinal properties. One key nutraceutical from the plant kingdom that has proven to enhance natural killer cells (special cells that attack cancer) is AHCC* (Active Hexose Correlated Compounds)a proprietary blend of mushroom mycelia extract that was developed by scientists in Japan.
*The Amino Up Chemical Company produces AHCC in commercial quantities at its facility in Sapporo, Japan.
Still skeptical? Just do a Google search.
Here is a list of the published research:
http://www.ahccpublishedresearch.com/wwwroot-ahcc/default.htm
As outlined in the research studies, AHCC stimulates the production of NK cells, killer T-cells, and cytokines such as interferon. Making it a welcomed weapon against chronic infections as well as cancer.
In Japan, AHCC is routinely used in the treatment of cancer patients. It has been found to reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy and has also been documented to increase the survival rates of cancer patients.
AHCC is a trademarked product sold by Quality of Life Labs as . Other recognized supplement companies such as NOW Foods have also formulated products using AHCC. NOW Foods sells this trademarked product as **the same potency for less cost than . For additional savings, buy the powdered form and not the capsules. Mix it into a smoothie or soft food like yogurt or applesauce. Your dog will enjoy lapping up these tasty foods too!Kinoko Gold AHCCAHCC Immune SupportKinoko Gold

Human adult dose is 2-6 capsules per day, preferably on an empty stomach. Use the higher dose (2 capsules 3 times per day, for a total of 9) to battle cancer or fight off infections. Use the lower dose (2 capsules daily) for disease prevention.
A supplement rule of thumb for dogs:give one-fourth the human dose to dogs under 25 pounds; one-half the dose for dogs between 25 and 40 pounds; three-fourths the dose for dogs between 40 and 55 pounds; the full dose for dogs over 55lbs. AHCC has no reported side effects and is regarded to be very safe.
Dont be confused by the many different types of medicinal mushroom products available. Many have merit. To name just a few well studied mushrooms: Maitake, Shitake, Reishi and Cordycepsall have been shown to have many healthy benefits. More of these mushrooms are popping up in natural food markets since they have become popular food-fare among health enthusiasts.
So you see, it is possible for us to help ourselves and our canine pals boost the natural abilities of an amazing immune system to battle cancer and other health threats. Yes, we can fight back!
Taking is a far different approach from swallowing toxic chemo cocktails in the war against cancer or using a super charged line of antibiotics ready to combat the next super bug. By working with the bodys intelligence we can evoke its natural healing powers and not worry about the negative side effects or fallout from using our super power, Big Pharma. Declaring should be our last resort, never our first option!Nutraceuticalsdrug war
Nutraceuticals, another gift from Mother Natures medicine cabinet, offer real help for an army of natural fighting soldiers. Remember, a top notch immune system is your best defense to ward off any type of illnesseven cancer!
