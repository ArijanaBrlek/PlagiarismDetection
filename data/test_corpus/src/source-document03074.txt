The late billionaire's money is being used to probe life's medical mysteries through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, America's second largest charity worth about $11 billion.

The new money will fund 56 additional scientists working in a variety of medical fields including genetics. One question to be studied: is climate change affecting the spread of cholera and malaria.
