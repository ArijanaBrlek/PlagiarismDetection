STAR TREK
THE FEATURE FILMS
Ten years after 's cancellation and on the heels of the aborted TV series, the entire cast returned to a refitted in a $44-million special effects adventure - one of the most expensive feature films of its day. The basis of the script used for the film was a script from - "In Thy Image." Both and , originally slated to appear in , were then cast in . Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, the film still managed to bring in a respectable $82 million at the box office. Due to production problems with the special effects and pushing up against a release date set in stone by the studio, the resulting film, while visually stunning, was overly reliant on the special effects. It also seemed as if all of the cast had forgotten the characters they played a decade ago. Still, the film was a success and fans later lobbied Paramount to re-release the film with footage reportedly cut from the original release. Paramount, relatively gun-shy on the subject of re-releasing a film so quickly to the theaters, instead issued a video version with 12 minutes of previously unseen footage. In 2001, director , who had tried for many years to distance himself from , decided to embrace the film once more. Working with the studio, new special effects shots were created in line with what had been originally intended by the renowned director and the film was released on DVD. The film also introduced a new look for the Klingons, which would carry over to the other series including , , and even to the 'prequel' series which is set 150 years before Kirk. Bjo Trimble, the woman who helped orchestrate the 1967 letter-writing campaign that kept from being cancelled after the first season, appears as an extra. On repeated viewings recently, I found that while the film is terribly stiff, it isn't really bad. And a theory put forth in novel - that the 'machine planet' that Voyager 6 encountered after coming out of the black hole was actually the Borg homeworld - seems to actually play really well in hindsight.The Motion Picture

While could hardly be called a disaster, it failed to produce the fire at the box office that Paramount was expecting. They had hopped to tap into the fan base and reap some of the windfall that had been created by Lucas with "Star Wars". Stinging from the expense if , the studio decided to give the franchise another go on the big screen - but this time with very strict controls on the budget. Paramount tapped famous television producer to produce this next big screen adventure for the crew of the starship . Bennett screened all seventy-nine episodes of the original series to get a feel for the characters and what had been done before. The 1967 episode struck him as having the potential to bring the continuation of that story to the big screen. Work began and Bennett was able to regroup the entire cast of the show, plus the added bonus of Ricardo Montalban returning to his role of Genetic Superman egomaniac Khan Noonian Singh. Produced on what was literally a 'made for TV' movie budget of $11 million, was steered by and provided the film with the feel of a high-seas adventure. The crew interaction, little more than stick figures in recovered in this film, returning to the camaraderie so familiar during the three years of the series. The Starship took a beating at the hands of Khan in a hijacked Federation starship and fans were shocked into silence as the death of Spock. Paramount could not have been more pleased with at the box office. While it did not gross as much money as the first feature film, taking in $79 million in domestic ticket sales, it did prove the franchise was viable. Could a third installment be far behind? During the years after the theatrical release and perhaps as a result of the interest generated by the extended version of , Paramount restored several minutes of footage to for airings on network television. Fans requested this extended cut be released on video for years, but they were met with disappointment. However, in early 2002, Nicolas Meyer returned to his first outing and issued which included the footage cut from theatrical release, but included in the television airings. That version was released on DVD in August of 2002.The Wrath of Khan

This sequel served as a bridge between two much better movies. is not considered the weakest of the series, but it was this film that triggered what is now referred to as the odd-numbered curse. There isn't much done to move our characters along, really - what we have is a story that ties up all the loose ends left by . Spock's death. The mind meld that gave McCoy Spock's katra. The creation of the Genesis Planet - and it's destruction. One thing about the Genesis Planet that always bothered me - if the Genesis matrix was so unstable that the planet literally ripped itself apart in just a few short days, how on earth was the Genesis Cave in so stable? And, let's be honest for a minute - would Carol Marcus really have allowed something as unstable as proto-matter in her research? And where is she through this whole film? She didn't strike me as the type that would create a planet an then just disappear into the cosmos. Perhaps it was felt that recasting Saavik was shocking enough and adding a new actress for Carol Marcus would have put us all over the edge. In what would become a trend in films, those which focus too much on just a few characters seem to suffer the most. is no different. Our focus this outing is mainly on Kirk, Spock and McCoy (just like the poorly received ). And even then, Spock wasn't in the first 70 minutes of the film. Scotty doesn't have much to do except help steal the . Chekov gives a third of the self-destruct sequence that destroys the . Uhura runs a transporter platform in Space Dock and Sulu wears a flowing leather cape. Stories that are strong actually give all the characters something to do - a purpose that moves the story along. This point alone is where and excel. The Bird-of-Prey made its first appearance as a Klingon ship - the term had been Romulan in . Apparently, in early working drafts of the script, Kruge stole the ship from the Romulans. The Romulans were eventually cut from the film, the ship made into a Klingon vessel, but the ship class retained the name. The Bird of Prey has gone on to became part of all subsequent adventures. The third theatrical installment in the franchise was produced for just $17 million. And like the previous outing, the box office take was very promising - pulling on over $76 million in domestic ticket sales. And since the death of Spock proved to be a gut-wrenching twist for the fans, the producers decided to do it again - but this time the character that was lost was the herself. Watching the saucer section literally melt away and then explode brought a lump to my throat. But with such a box office performance, I knew the mighty Starship would return.The Search for Spock

was the first in a series of films planned for crew, and opened at the box office with greater success than any previous film - mostly because it promised to unite the cast with the Kirk-Scotty-Chekov trio of the classic series. (Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly declined.) was considered by many to be the swan song for the original cast, and the much-rumored climax involving Kirk's death was another draw for Trekkers. The hit film was visually stunning from start to finish, with a renovated (complete with a stellar cartography lab) and outstanding special effects - topped by the amazing saucer-section crash. In terms of dramatic appeal, there were riveting scenes between the steely-edged Picard (while mourning the loss of his brother and nephew) and the hot-tempered Kirk as they confront the evil Dr. Soran, who is deliciously played by science-fiction veteran Malcolm McDowell. Brent Spiner does another fine turn as Data, who, equipped with an emotion chip, loses control and succumbs to fits of laughter, cowardice and remorse. Also neatly woven into the story line are the Klingon Duras sisters, who meet their demise in a spectacular battle with the .Generations

returns the crew from to the big screen. Back at the helm once again is director who seems to have a firm grasp on the franchise and understands how the characters are supposed to interact. The ninth feature film outing opened to underwhelming numbers and bested only in opening weekend grosses. The final box office numbers would be disappointing as well, pulling in just $70 million in domestic grosses. Clearly superior to Star Trek V's $55 million numbers, it still ranks eighth overall in domestic gross. It is not clear if one could attribute these problems to what has been called "the odd number curse." has highly imaginative special effects and a few surprises, but the troubles with the film rest almost solely on the story. This outing was penned by long time series veterans Rick Berman and Michael Piller and while the screenplay would have played wonderfully on the television screen, the outing hardly seems fitting for our large screen entertainment dollar. Very little about Star Trek was new in this outing. The re-kindling of the relationship between Commander Riker and Counselor Troi marked the final closure of the relationship between Troi and Worf. Jerry Goldsmith returns to compose his third Star Trek feature.Insurrection

The second weekend proved even more disastrous, dropping 76% to bring in only $4.4 million. proves to be the most expensive production to date (reported at $70 million). The domestic box office stalled at $47 million, with the worldwide totals bringing in another $50 million. With such poor numbers, it is the first to not break even. Even managed to clear it's $27 million budget. Unsure of where to place the blame, many feel the director's unfamiliarity with the material could be a bulk of the problem. The story, however is not without its faults. Several have drawn parallels between our story of the long lost Remans (offshoot of the Romulan empire) and the films last half in particular to events of . As with all previous outings of crew (with the exception of ), this story would have played out much better on the television screen, and is the weakest outing of the series for our crew of the . Little is done with our crew except to further splinter the cast. Riker and Troi finally get married and their wedding night on provides one of the films several out of place elements. The invasion of Troi's thoughts during the lovemaking scene by our head villain () does nothing to further the story and seems this thread is the only reason for Troi's appearance in the film at all. Also around for what seems like set dressing are Worf - whose absence from is never explained, Geordi - who spends less time in engineering than ever before and Beverly Crusher - who does little more than declare that our villain is Captain Picard's clone. While he has no functional part in the film, makes an appearance at Troi's and Riker's wedding in full Starfleet dress uniform. Didn't he leave Starfleet to become one with the cosmos? Clearly this outing is the "Picard & Data Show". Anything of interest in the story whatsoever happens to these two. How sad it is to see what was once an ensemble cast be reduced to two headliners and a bunch of bit parts. Jerry Goldsmith returns to score his fourth and final feature.Nemesis
