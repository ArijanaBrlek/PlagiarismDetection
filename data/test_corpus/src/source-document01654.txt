From gigs in tiny church halls in the mid-sixties to multi-million selling albums and spectacular stadium shows all around the world, the Pink Floyd story in a rock legend.
This remarkable book is a celebration of Pink Floyd's entire career - 2007 marks the official 40th anniversary since they started recording. It contains a biographical account of the band's collective and individual careers from their pre-Floyd origins in 1962 right through to the present day.
Echoes also combines, for the very first time, a meticulously researched chronological listing of every single Pink Floyd and solo concert, set list, TV and radio appearance plus a UK and US discography.
Illustrated throughout with a wealth of rare and previously unpublished photographs as well as rare graphic memorabilia, including posters, advertisements, handbills and tickets from every era of the band's remarkable history, it is, quite simply, the most comprehensive account of Pink Floyd in print.

Customer Reviews
This has it all,wonderful pictures and is a great read even if you know the bands history. But its very heavy in its weight so be careful :)Great book
I have long been a Pink Floyd fan and this book is a work of art. It is both beautiful in design and accurate in its detail on the band. I strongly recommend it as a fantastic factual reference book. Even if you don't read it, buy it for the pictures. If you love this band, buy this book.A comprehensive encyclopedia of knowledge
