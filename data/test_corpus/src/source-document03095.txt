Very Few Arabica Coffees Meet Starbucks Standards
The coffee we buy is truly special, spectacular coffee. The coffee buying team evaluates over 1,000 "offer samples" each year, and only a few make it into our warehouses. Starbucks coffee buyers spend approximately 18 weeks per year traveling to countries of origin. The purpose of these travels is not to directly buy coffee. The goal is to continue to learn about coffee and to strengthen relationships with growers and suppliers. These relationships are critical to our future success - they solidify our role as champions of quality and progress at every level of the coffee business. It is because of these relationships that Starbucks gets the first pick of the best crops worldwide.
