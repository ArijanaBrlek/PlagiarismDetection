Nupedia had an elaborate system of and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow. During 2000, , founder of Nupedia, and , whom Wales had employed to work on the project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources are suggested for the idea that a might allow members of the public to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10.

There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a Web site in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 (now called "" by some users). The and (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past employees who have worked on the project include , one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey. The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the not-for-profit was launched as its new parent organization, prompting the use of a ".org" domain to denote its non-commercial nature. In March 2007, the word became a newly-recognized English word. Wikipedia Day bandwidth server Bomis Tim Shell Wikimedia Foundation wiki [1]

Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content. About 75,000 editors  from expert scholars to casual readers  regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our . Manual of Style
Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining . Editors are able to watch pages and techies can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits. Over 1,500 administrators with special powers ensure that behaviour conforms to Wikipedia guidelines and policies. Where there are disagreements on how to present facts, editors work together to arrive at an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject. The administrators can temporarily or permanently ban editors of Wikipedia who fail to work with others in a civil manner. civility

Using Wikipedia as a research tool
Main articles: and Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia
As a , articles are never complete. They are continually edited and improved over time. In general, this results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a representation of information. wiki fair and balanced
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as partisan; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argument, they gradually take on a reached through . Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time  months perhaps  to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article that they edit comprehensive. However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, the editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article. neutral point of view consensus
The Wikipedia article is well-written, balanced, , and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second best tier of articles are designated . However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved, as each user adds their contribution in turn. Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully . Others will later be augmented with new sections.

Wikipedia vs. paper encyclopedias
Main article: (on ) Wiki is not paper Wikimedia Meta-Wiki
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries and a low environmental impact, since it need never be printed. In addition, Wikipedia has instead of in-line explanations and it incorporates overview summaries (article introductions) with the extensive detail of a full article. Additionally, the editorial cycle is short. A paper encyclopedia stays the same until the next edition, whereas writers update Wikipedia at every instant, around the clock, ensuring that it stays abreast of the most recent events and scholarship. wikilinks
Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia
Main articles: and Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is so great Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
Wikipedia is , drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias. A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that Wikipedia can produce excellent encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence. It also means that like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions. While articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, et cetera) and may, therefore, show some bias. Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth.open to a large contributor base "obviously important" topics most
Allowing Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal. While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. However, bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key , or may add information without sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring and edits to articles on their .anyone to edit policies citable recent changes watchlist
Wikipedia is  an approach that has its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing "official" points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time. Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their "neutral approach" that all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by . Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed.written by open and transparent consensus neutral point of view extreme-viewpoint contributors
That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterwards he "didnt know was used as a serious reference tool.") Therefore, a common conclusion is that it is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects. this incident Wikipedia
The software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes". Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously- or thoughtfully-advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. Like any source, information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of new that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media), namely "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources."
