Slam! Bringing Poetry to Life
Authenticity
Key QuestionHow can students use performance techniques to bring the written word to life and share their own poems with the school community?
OverviewThis is not your usual poetry unit where students study Wordsworth, Longfellow, and symbolism. Slam! encourages high school juniors to bring their own words to life by introducing performance art through videos, guest speakers, CDs. Even the most reluctant performer is showcased in classroom poetry slams. Taking their show on the road, students share mini poetry lessons with grade 10 classes. They also include their own poems and other favorites in an anthology that they present to the school library. The culminating schoolwide poetry Slam! is all about respect for everyone's creations. The audience - including students, family, professional writers, teachers, and the Headmaster - steps up to the mike and shares spoken words. Slam! proves that, rehearsed and performed in the right school setting, poetry is alive and well.
