Next Generation Luminaires
The Next Generation Luminairesâ„¢ (NGL) Solid State Lighting (SSL) Design Competition seeks to encourage technical innovation and recognize and promote excellence in the design of energy-efficient LED commercial lighting luminaires.
Next Generation Luminaires encourages manufacturers to develop innovative commercial luminaires that are energy-efficient and provide high lighting quality and consistency, glare control, lumen maintenance, and luminaire appearance needed to meet specification lighting requirements.
Background
The Department of Energy (DOE) administers federal investment in SSL research and development to advance the technology and realize its projected energy efficiency, lighting service, and economic benefits. DOE has developed a comprehensive program to support the effective commercialization and application of SSL in the general illumination market. This program includes , , , , and , to recognize and reward excellence in application of this emerging technology. technology demonstrations product testing development of industry performance standards and test procedures information dissemination design competitions
On-going advances in SSL technology and the growing number of product introductions signal an opportunity to encourage, recognize, and promote LED luminaires suitable for the commercial specification market, implicitly differentiating them from LED products that will not meet the needs of lighting designers, specifiers, and users. DOE has partnered with the (IESNA) and the (IALD) to organize this new competition. Illuminating Engineering Society of North America International Association of Lighting Designers
Participants
The competition is open to LED, lighting, lighting system, and luminaire manufacturers, including LED device and system manufacturers in conjunction with their luminaire manufacturing partners.
