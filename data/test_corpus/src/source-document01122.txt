Diabetes is a serious health burden that continues to grow. The diabetes communities are now forced to respond and acknowledge three choices. The first is to prevent or get away with the disease, second is to have it cured before it gets worse and the last choice will be to take care and watch over the people who have it already. This is to prevent the different complications associated with the disease, because it can be very devastating.
All the approaches are now being worked out by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The former is involved in research works to come out with different methods to cure and prevent both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
For the meantime, NIH will only be focusing for the prevention of Type 1 diabetes. On the other hand, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is focused mostly with the programs they are doing. Currently they are making sure that all the measures which have been proven by science is placed into the actual daily practice for the people who are dealing with the disease.
To conclude, NIH and CDC gather every important research and science, which is very vital for the daily lives of people who are fighting against diabetes. The approaches that are currently being pursued for the possible cure for diabetes are: transplantation of the pancreas and islet cells, development of an artificial pancreas and genetic manipulation.
Transplantation of Pancreas
This is an organ transplant. Here the healthy pancreas from a donor is being implanted to a person whos suffering from diabetes. However, pancreas transplant should not be done when a person does have a heart or a blood vessel disease. The pancreas is very necessary for the digestion process. During the operation, the recipient pancreas will still remain in its place and the donated pancreas will be attached in a different location.
In some cases, the new pancreas can even be rejected by the system of the recipients body. That is why the original pancreas is not removed from its original position. The healthy pancreas for transplant should come from a donor who has just died, because it is not possible to get a living donors pancreas since it is very necessary for digestion.
