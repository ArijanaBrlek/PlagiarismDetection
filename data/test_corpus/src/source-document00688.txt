We offer these packages to give organizations quantity discount on multiple jobs. These packages are ideal for small and mid- sized companies.
- With these packages, your company can post unlimited jobs in the timeframe purchased. For example an unlimited 3 month package will provide your company the ability to post unlimited jobs for 90 days. In addition, these packages also include limited access to the resume database.2) Unlimited Job Posting Packages
These packages provide greater economic savings and are ideal for mid and large sized organizations.
About Resume Database Access
Unlimited job posting packages included a standard resume database package. The standard resume database access has some restrictions on the number of resume views over the duration of the page. This measure is in place to prevent misuse/abuse. Please contact our sales department for the resume database terms. Resume database access is not included with single job postings or quantity job posting packages but can be purchased separately. For rate information for resume database only, please . contact us
