About Drake Software
Mission Statement & Core Values
Headquartered in scenic Franklin, North Carolina, Drake Software is a rapidly growing tax preparation software company. The Drake family has influenced the business community in Franklin since 1954, when Clyde Drake, father of the current owner, Phil Drake, opened what would soon become a successful tax preparation business. The younger Drake started developing tax preparation software in the 1970s. In 1977, he decided to discontinue preparing tax returns, and instead focus his energy on tax software. That year, Phil made the decision not to compete with tax preparers, a choice that continues to impact the direction of the company to this day. When the IRS implemented a new program for electronically filing individual and business tax returns in 1986, Phil soon began using the new technology, transmitting some of the first electronically filed tax returns in North Carolina. In 2004, Drake Software won the IRS Modernized e-file Pioneer Award for its initiative in electronically filing tax returns. Today, over 26,000 tax professionals nationwide use Drake Software. In 2007, Drake delivered over 7 million federal accepted returns and 6 million state accepted returns. The company provides free electronic filing and excellent federal and state programming. Year after year, Drakes cutting edge research and development gives tax professionals the tools they need to build successful tax preparation businesses. Drake Software employs over 300 people who live and work in the area. We are proud of the high caliber individuals who consistently deliver superior performances.
