Do not go where the path might lead.  Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.

DID YOU KNOW
Of all the Essex class carriers built for service in WWII, none were ever sunk by the enemy.  Several, including Ticonderoga, suffered major damage but all survived the war and beyond.
 
WHAT'S A HEAD??
Well, if you've got any nautical experience you know that a "head" is the bathroom.  But did you know this:
Not many people know that Edison was an avid fisherman.  He usually included some trout fishing in his infrequent vacations. During one such trip to the west he was befriended by a native American tribe.  They provided free room and board, as well as expert fishing guides for his stay.  On his first night he discovered that the only sanitary facility was an old-fashioned outhouse.  To make things worse it had no light even though the village had electricity in the homes. As a thank-you gift for their kindnesses, Edison purchased the necessary materials and personally installed lighting in the their privy. He thus became the first person to wire a head for a reservation.
 
Love cures people--both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.

Any man who may be asked in this century what he did to make his life worthwhile, can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction, "I served in the United States Navy"
President John F. Kennedy, August 1, 1963, US Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD.
