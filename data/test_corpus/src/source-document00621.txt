Benner's Deer Fencing -is a high-strength, wire fence-like mesh (1.75 inch) material constructed of UV stable black polypropylene. This "hi-tech" plastic fence is 7 #39; feet high, cost-effective, easy to install, and provides long-term deer protection without changing the appearance of the property. The ultimate installed height of the fencing is approximately 7'. Six inches of the plastic fence grid is "flared" out onto the ground away from the protected area to keep deer from pushing underneath the fencing. For over ten years now this height has proven to be sufficient. Because deer have poor depth perception and cannot see where the fencing actually stops; they are fearful of jumping it (when pressed, whitetail deer can jump over 10'). In fact, when Benner's Deer Fencing is first installed, white flagging streamers (included) need to be temporarily tied to the fencing every 10 feet so the deer do not run right into it. Unlike electric or wire fence, Benner's deer fencing can be easily attached to existing trees (up to 20 - 25 feet apart). In areas where trees are not present, galvanized steel pipes (baked on black finish) can be installed for support. The fencing is also staked to the ground with ground stakes every five to six feet to keep the deer from pushing underneath it.

440 Fence Company, Inc. -was spawned from the 440 Ranches which at one time were some of the largest quarter horse breeding and training facilities in the world. Still to this day, 440 holds the numbers 1, 3, and 11 spots in all-time leading money earning quarter horses either sired by a 440 Ranch stallion or out of a 440 Ranch mare. Needless to say, 440 has done its share of fencing and knows what it takes to safely fence in livestock. Through years of experience and research, 440 Ranch personel have designed and patented what many would call a "FINAL FENCING SOLUTION".Steel fence is the only truly permanent fencing option on the market. In the past, a custom welded fence was your only choice but with that strength and longevity comes a lifetime of maintenance. All steel fences prior to the 440 Fence would rust and need to be painted every couple of years.440 uses a 4-layer patented process that invloves galvanizing and powdercoating the steel to prevent UV damage and rust. With this in mind, you will never have to paint or replace the 440 Fence and you might also agree that it truly is a "final fencing solution

Guardian Fence System , -you can meet fence project requirements in a cost-effective manner, while also gaining a more secure and better-looking solution. The secret to the Guardian system is an all-new, patent-pending development of an Interlocking Modular Fence System that utilizes a vast array of infill materials to construct the fence. Because of the unique design of the Guardian system, existing fences with inexact or irregular post settings - such as chain link - can be easily and affordably retrofitted with a higher security and more aesthetically pleasing alternative. Plus, the system is capable of employing a dual layer of material, either the same type, or two different types that may be considered to be complimentary in nature based on the application. The system can also use one type material at the bottom and an alternate type, or alternating types arranged vertically based on a particular purpose. Also, as ASTM completes a new standardization of the Department of State crash rating, you can be assured that tests of the Guardian Fence System will be conducted in accordance with the new standard. Our engineers expect these tests will confirm the unparalleled strength, security and anti-ram properties of this modular crash barrier. By design, the Guardian Fence System can be installed more quickly and at less expense than other fence solutions providing similar security barriers. This has proven to provide overall lower project costs and faster turnaround for contractors and clients.
