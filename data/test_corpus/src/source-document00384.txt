Sorry , I haven't been there yet, but would LOVE to go. Since you are from Canada and are going to Brazil, I have a couple of questions for you: 1) Have you heard of Mona Vie? (It's a nutritional beverage company that is open in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and SOON, in BRAZIL!!!) 2) How would you like to be one of the first Canadian distributors to have people under you from a country that will be launching our product soon? MONA VIE in BRAZIL!!! The Acai Berry nutritional beverage will be made available in it's native country, Brasil (Brazil). Distributors are able to JOIN FOR FREE during this pre-launch period. More info: or at: Don't let this awesome opportunity pass you by!!!
