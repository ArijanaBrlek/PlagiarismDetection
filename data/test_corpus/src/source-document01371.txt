Every day, Defenders are helping to save lives, deliver medical care and service industry in areas that only a Defender can survive.
 
From the poles to the equator, the Defender has proven itself to have no equal.
Supreme traction and agility enables Defender to climb and descend the steepest of slopes  even in reverse gear, while a wide choice of gearing allows you to power uphill or to crawl competently and safely at extreme angles over loose earth.
 
Efficient engine braking, matched to a precise transmission means that even descending a 45 degree slope is easy work as Defender advances confidently just on engine tickover.
A ground-gripping handbrake controlling all four wheels makes Defender the ultimate anchor-man whether hauling lifeboats from the sea or winching over terrain that would be otherwise impassable.
For those who need the power and strength to pull heavy loads, the Defender's stance, traction and grip makes it the world's favourite tow vehicle.
If you're looking for the perfect people carrier then there's always the 110 Station Wagon, offering comfort and space for up to 9 people.
