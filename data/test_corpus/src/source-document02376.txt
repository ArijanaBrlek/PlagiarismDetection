LDL Cholesterol
The term "LDL cholesterol" refers to a substance that transports cholesterol from the liver to tissues throughout the body. Too much of this in the blood can lead to plaque buildup on the walls of your arteries, which can cause a blockage. The more LDL you have in your blood, the greater your risk of heart disease. However, it can be lowered through lifestyle changes and medication.
 
What Is LDL Cholesterol?
LDL is another name for low density lipoprotein (LDL). It is a substance found within the body that is used to transport cholesterol to tissues that need it. It is also known as "." cholesterol bad cholesterol
 
Understanding Lipoproteins
Cholesterol is a fat that is made in your body. It is also in some foods that you eat. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.
 
In order to get to all of your cells, cholesterol needs to travel through the bloodstream. But because cholesterol is a fat, it separates from the blood similar to the way that oil separates from water.
 
In order to prevent this from happening, proteins form a shell around the cholesterol, creating a "cholesterol complex." It is then released into the bloodstream and travels to where it needs to go.
 
A protein that is linked to cholesterol to form this cholesterol complex is called a "lipoprotein." There are several different types of lipoproteins. When talking about cholesterol, though, we normally talk about two types of lipoproteins. One is good and the other be bad. You have probably heard about "" and "bad cholesterol." However, in both good cholesterol () and bad cholesterol (LDL), the cholesterol is the same; what makes it good or bad is the type of lipoprotein it is within.can good cholesterol HDL
 
Why Is LDL Cholesterol Known as "The Bad Cholesterol?"
Normally, LDLs transport cholesterol from your liver and deliver it to the tissues that need it. But if you have a lot of LDLs left over after all of your tissues have been taken care of, the LDLs will "let go" of the extra cholesterol while traveling through your blood. This LDL cholesterol can build up on the walls of your arteries (blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body). This buildup of cholesterol is called , and over time, it can cause narrowing or . This condition is called .
 
The Numbers
LDL is the main source of damaging buildup and blockage in the arteries. Therefore, the more you have in your blood, the greater your risk of . But how much is too much? cholesterol heart disease
 
Your "healthy" LDL will depend on how many other you have. If you have or are at high risk for developing it, your ideal LDL may be below 100 mg/dL. If you have no , your ideal LDL may be below 160 mg/dL. cholesterol number heart disease risk factors heart disease cholesterol level risk factors for heart disease cholesterol level

Lowering Your LDL Cholesterol
In general, the higher your LDL cholesterol level and the more risk factors you have, the greater your chances of developing heart disease or other . Treatment for (also known as hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia) focuses on lowering your LDL level enough to reduce your chances of developing these conditions. There are two main ways to lower your LDL cholesterol: effects of high cholesterol high cholesterol
