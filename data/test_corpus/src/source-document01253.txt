Each rapid transit system consists of one or more lines a service that operates a particular route stopping at predetermined stations. Most systems operate several routes, and distinguished them by numbering, names and colors. The lines may share track with each other, or operate solely on their own right-of-way. The simplest solution is a fork out from a common line in the city center, used by many of the smaller systems, such as the . Another solution is to have a single central terminal (often shared with the central railway station), or the use of multiple interchange stations between lines in the city center, for instance used by the . Some of the largest systems are so extensive that they become a large matrix, with interchanges throughout the system, even in the outer sections of the system, such as the and the . Some systems, such as the have a loop line around the city center connecting the outward going lines.

The capacity of a system for each line is a multiplication of car capacity, train length and . Normal length of heavy rapid transit trains is six to twelve cars, while lighter systems may use only three or four cars. Cars have a capacity of 100 to 150, varying with the more standing gives higher capacity. , used mostly on German S-Bahn type systems, allow for the higher seating needed on longer journeys. The headway between services is less with rapid transit than mainline railways owing to the use of ; the theoretical minimum headway being 90 seconds, but in practice limited to 120 seconds to allow for recovering from delays. Typical capacity lines allow for 1,200 people per train, giving 36,000 people per hour.

Rapid transit operators often have built up strong ; in particular the use of a single letter to establish the presence of stations has become widely used, with systems identified by the letters L, M, S, T and U, among others. Branding has been focused on easy recognition to allow quick identification even in the vast array of impressions found in large cities combined with the need to communicate speed, safety and authority. In many cities, there is a single for the entire transit authority, but the rapid transit uses its own logo that fits into the profile. brand [3] [22] image
A is a in the form of a used to illustrate the routes and stations within a system. The main components are lines to indicate each line or service, with named icons to indicate stations. Maps may include only the rapid transit, or other modes of public transport. transit map typological map schematic diagram public transport color coded [23]
Transit maps can be found in the transit vehicles, at the or in printed . Their primary function is to help users to efficiently use the public transport system, including which stations function as between lines. Unlike conventional maps, transit maps are usually not geographic accurate instead they use straight lines and fixed angles, and often illustrate a fixed distance between stations, compressing those in the outer area of the system and expanding those close to the center. Timetables are only published if frequency is so low that passengers can easily time their arrival to the station; if the is sufficient, the effect of there "always being a train" is achieved, and passengers will not need a timetable. This effect is normally considered reached between headways of five and ten minutes. platforms timetables interchange [23] headway [24]
