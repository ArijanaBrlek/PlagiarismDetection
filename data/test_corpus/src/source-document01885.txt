We have a collection of Atari Lynx hand–held retro games consoles and a selection of game packs. The consoles can be bought individually and your choice from the Atari Lynx games packs can be purchased as an optional extra. We also offer a few of the rarer retro games as an individual purchase. See the drop–down menu below. The Atari Lynx consoles were designed to be operated using six AA batteries or an AC mains adaptor . From the safety aspect and due to their age, we do not supply the original power sources with the consoles - the prices reflect this decision. However, the consoles have been tested with both mains adaptors and batteries and they are in full working order.Atari Lynx Retro Games Consoles

The world first portable colour entertainment system. This Atari Lynx console, manufactured in the early 1990, features a full colour LCD, 8 direction joypad, plus a 32 bit audio processor to create realistic sound for maximum enjoyment. This is a boxed item and comes with one free game – California games. Due to the age of the console and for health and safety reasons we have not included the original power pack but the Lynx can be operated very effectively with six AA batteries. A new AC adaptor could be purchased if you wished.
