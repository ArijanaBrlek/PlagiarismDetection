Within-subject repeated-measures study. To examine the immediate effects of counterforce forearm brace on isokinetic strength, stretch reflex, passive stretching pain threshold of the wrist extensors, and proprioception of the wrist in subjects with lateral humeral epicondylosis for different strap tensions of a forearm brace. Counterforce forearm bracing has been used for treating lateral humeral epicondylosis, but the effect of brace tension has not been well reported. Fifteen subjects diagnosed with lateral humeral epicondylosis on their dominant arm were tested under 4 randomized conditions: (1) no brace, (2) brace with minimal tension, (3) brace with 25-N tension, and (4) brace with 50-N tension. The tests included isokinetic wrist extensors strength, passive stretching force in wrist flexion to elicit pain in the wrist extensors, wrist proprioception, and stretch reflex latency of the extensor carpi ulnaris. A repeated-measures MANOVA was used to analyze the data and significant results were further analyzed with post hoc linear contrasts (α = .05). Among the 4 conditions, significant differences were found in wrist proprioception (P = .032) and pain threshold to passive stretching of the wrist extensors (P = .05), but were not found in wrist extension isokinetic strength and stretch reflex latency of the extensor carpi ulnaris. A forearm counterforce brace, as applied in this study, affects wrist joint proprioception and increases the pain threshold to passive stretching of the wrist extensors in subjects with lateral humeral epicondylosis, but it has no effect on wrist extensor strength and stretch reflex latency of the extensor carpi ulnaris.Study Design:Objectives:Background:Methods and Measures:Results:Conclusion:
