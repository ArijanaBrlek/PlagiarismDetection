* A recruiting MLM is an MLM with a compensation system that rewards recruitment more than actual sales of products to persons outside the network of participants. So significant income is unlikely without recruitment of a large downline.
Fair and equitable distribution of income in compensation plans for participants who focus on product sales are extremely rare in MLM/network marketing. Where such MLM programs exist, I call them "retail MLM's". In such programs, every participant can earn a reasonable income for their efforts in selling products without recruiting a large downline. Out of hundreds of MLM's I have reviewed, Pampered Chef is one of those extremely rare MLM/network marketing programs that can be classified as a legitimate "retail MLM," or legitimate direct sales company. According to its web site, Pampered Chef has 70,000 Independent Kitchen Consultants serving 12 million customers worldwide. Products are sold primarily through in-home cooking demonstrations known as Kitchen Shows (over 1 million are held in the United States each year).
In contrast, a "recruiting MLM*"uses a compensation system that rewards recruitment more than actual sales of products to persons outside the network of participants. So significant income is unlikely without recruitment of a large downlineIn a recruiting MLM, there are "" in its compensation plan which, taken together, lead to the abuses of a product-based pyramid scheme.. 5 Red Flags The "no" answers to questions #3, #4, and #5 in the table below clearly place Pampered Chef outside the category of a recruiting MLM.
The Pampered Chef compensation plan is commendable in several respects: (1) For any given sale, commissions to those actually selling the products exceeds what is paid to the total upline. (2) Override commissions diminish at each level removed from the actual sale. (3) There are a maximum payout of three levels of override commissions, which assures that the focus will be on selling products, rather than on recruiting. (This is in sharp contrast to MLM companies which pay on more than 5 levels and which may pay as much or more in overrides to participants several levels above the person selling the product as to the participant whorecruitedthe actual seller.) Also, (4) The Pampered Chef's compensation plan is a straightforward and easy to understand unitary system, as opposed to systems referred to as breakaway, matrix, binary, trinary, or combinations of these.
 
Here is how PAMPERED CHEF stacks up against the "5 Red Flags" of a recruiting MLM, or product-based pyramid scheme   
YES
NO
1.Recruitment of participants is unlimited in an endless chain of empowered and motivated recruiters recruiting recruiters.(However, recruiting incentives are reasonably limited with Pampered Chef.)
P
 
2. Advancement in a hierarchy of multiple levels of participants is achieved by recruitment, rather than by appointment.  
P
 
3. Significant requirements that participants "pay to play" the game via product purchases. Thus, new recruits are the primary customers. (NoWithPampered Chef, consultants' orders for products from the company are filled on credit and based on actual orders from customers. Products are shipped directly to customers, so no inventory stocking is required by consultants. Also, override commissions are not paid on consultants' personal orders.)
P
4. MLM company pays commissions and/or bonuses to at least 5 levels of participants, creating great "leverage" at the top.  (No Pampered Chef pays override commissions on only 3 upline levels, which diminish with each higher level.)
 
P
5. Most of the payout goes to the upline, rather than to the person selling products, creating excessive incentive to recruit and inadequate incentive to sell products (except to new recruits) and an extreme concentration of income at the top of a hierarchy (pyramid) of participants.(No Commissions or discounts for front-line Pampered Chefconsultantsrange from 20%-40%. Total of override commissions for the upline is far less than what is received by those actually doing the selling.)
