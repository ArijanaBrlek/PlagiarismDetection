A few satisfied customers ...
Donna M. Gwin Director of Human Resources Eastern Division Safeway Inc."Once the employer gets past the myth of "If we didn't do anything wrong, we shouldn't go to mediation" and decides to participate, the real issues in the dispute become clear. Through mediation, we have had the opportunity to proactively resolve issues and avoid potential charges in the future. We have seen the number of charges filed with EEOC against us actually decline. We believe that our participating in mediation and listening to employees' concerns has contributed to that decline."
Charles C. Warner, Esq. Porter Wright Morris & Arthur LLP"As an employer's attorney, I routinely recommend mediation to my clients. In mediation, you can build a sense of what the issues are, learn the problems, explore possible options for resolution, and make informed decisions whether or not resolving at that time or moving on is the best outcome for that matter. It makes both business and economic sense from the employer's perspective."
Linda I. Workman Vice President Workforce Effectiveness ConAgra Foods, Inc."Regardless of the issue or whether it has merit under Title VII, if it is draining resources, weighing on the mind of the employee, or having a negative impact on productivity, then getting the issue out on the table, mediating it and resolving it is often the smartest and most expeditious way to ensure workforce effectiveness."
Laurice Royal, Esq. Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation"Hopkins is striving to be an employer of choice. We think that participating in EEOC's mediation program moves us that much closer to meeting that goal. . . .We learned that settlement is not always about money. Sometimes there are non- economic ways to settle a case that may be important to the charging party and the respondent."
