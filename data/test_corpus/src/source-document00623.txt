Power Cooking
Good Morning Everyone, I know there has been a thead about Power Cooking and I have read the handouts, but I'm still a bit confused. I booked a Power Cooking show and it is coming up this Tuesday. How do you do the show? Do you just package the items? I'm a bit worried about this show. Please give me some advice if you have done this type of thing before. Any help is greatly appreciated. Smile,

It is completely typed out on here somewhere. Your host serves Taco Soup as the guests arrive, then you assemble 5 dinners that go in the host's freezer. I try to weave introductions into the middle, as you are pressing a ton of garlic, so I do the intros in the slow parts of the show. You end up doing the demo in about 45 minutes, even with all your spiel about all the products/bookings, etc. They can't believe you can assemble so many meals so quickly.

My Mood:
Just did one Friday night. You arrive early and make Taco Soup, garlic Pull Aparts, and a pan of brownies. For your demo, you talk about 5 power tools--Food Chopper, Ultimate Mandoline, Cookware, Stoneware, and Cutlery. You assemble three recipes for your host to put in your freezer that allow you to show these 5 biggies and other gadgets. I sold lots of Batter Bowls. I found it hard to keep the demo under 45 mins cuz I like to talk, but I think everyone enjoyed themselves and appreciated the info. I gave them a packet with all the recipes.
