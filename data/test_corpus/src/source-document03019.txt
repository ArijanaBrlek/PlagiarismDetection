[] edit Overview
Few cities of the world have a history as rich as that of Alexandria; few cities have witnessed so many historic events and legends. The city that has been immortalized in the works of Cavafy, Durrell and Forster, was named after its founder, Alexander the Great. Founded around 334 BC and designed by Deinocrates of Rhodes, Alexandria was one of the greatest cities in the Hellenistic world, second only to Rome in size and wealth. It was well known for its Lighthouse, which is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the Library of Alexandria, the largest library of the ancient world and the place where great philosophers and scientists of that age came to seek knowledge. Nowadays, Alexandria is the leading port of Egypt and is considered to be a major industrial and tourist city, with millions of tourists and guests coming to the city every year.
Alexandria has 5 well-known museums; the Greaco-Roman Museum, Alexandria National Museum, Royal Jewellery Museum, ElMax Aquarium and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina Museums (for antiquities, manuscripts, and science), and there are another 3 under construction. There are also 5 smaller museums, including the . Cavafy Museum
[] edit Illuminating the World
In ancient times, the Pharos of Alexandria was a beacon of light that brought ships to the safety of the Alexandrian harbor. It was important, as it not only provided guidance, but it also acted as a landmark to identify Egyptian soil; a landmark to the land of knowledge, thought and the ancient library of Alexandria. As we attempt here, in Alexandria, to resurrect the importance of the library and what it stood for, it seems suitable for us to regard the new library, not only as a modern version of the older one, but also as a beacon of light and guidance. To us, the new library combines the purpose of the ancient library and the Pharos, if only in a metaphorical sense. The slogan of our proposed Wikimania2008 bid, "Illuminating the World", is to show that we hope to stand for all what is needed to bring this world out of any darkness, to show our desire to enlighten the world and to provide it with the tools necessary to do so. By allowing knowledge to be available for all, as is the aim of the Wiki projects, we believe that we can achieve this goal of " Illuminating the World".
[] edit Why Wikimania 2008 in Alexandria?
North America, Europe and Asia have already had their opportunities with hosting Wikimania within their borders in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. It is now time for Africa to have its chance with Wikimania2008, especially with Bibliotheca Alexandrina as a hosting venue. Bibliotheca Alexandrina, as a foundation, supports and helps free access to knowledge, which is inline with the message of wiki projects. Symbolically, hosting Wikimania2008 in Alexandria would help to show the values that Wikipedia stands for: world harmony in the pursuit of knowledge.
[] edit Conference Venue
The venue will be provided for free to host Wikimania2008, including the technical facilities available at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina Conference Center (BACC).
Alexandrina Conference Center

Alexandrina Conference Center is a state-of-the-art meeting and exhibition facility and is an integral part of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina complex. It is located on the waterfront across from the Eastern Harbor and Silsilah Peninsula. The Conference Center and the main Library are connected underground below the Plaza of Civilization.
The Conference Center and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, in their joint capacity, combine to form a center of culture and knowledge worthy of serving Egypt, the Mediterranean Region, Africa and the World.
A distinguished feature of the BACC is that it was designed, first and foremost, for international conferences, and offers comprehensive services and diverse facilities.
