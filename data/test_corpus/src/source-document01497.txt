About
The Niagara Peninsula Geological Society (N.P.G.S.) has been operating as a non-profit society since 1962. Our goal is to bring people together who are interested in collecting rocks, minerals, fossils, and jewellery making. We have a wide mix of members from young to old, amateur to professional.
Meetings are held on the third Friday of every month from September through June. These meetings are always well attended. Everyone, even non-members, is invited to join us, listen to one of our guest speakers, and discuss their hobby or professional interests. Collecting  field trips are arranged several times a year to quarries and other locations in Ontario and the U.S.A. Once a year we host a rock and mineral show called GEO-VENTURE.
For more information about the N.P.G.S., please send us email at   If you would like to become a member of the N.P.G.S., a membership form can be downloaded and sent to our mailing address. Alternatively, you can visit one of our meetings, field trips or shows, and we would be happy to welcome you as a member. npgs@ccfms.ca
