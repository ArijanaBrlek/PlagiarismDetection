Today, we rolled up our sleeves and explored the . It isn't America's best-selling digital console piano by accident. From its high quality voices, 64 notes of polyphony, 88-key graded hammer technology, to its two-track sequencer, and stylish console piano looks, we'll take you inside the Yamaha YDP223 digital piano. If you've read our September 27, 2007 review of the P140, you will notice the YDP223 is very similar. A lot of the same content will be repeated here; however, we will also point out some unique features that are only found on the Yamaha YDP223 and will be italicized for convenience. When we sat down to review the Yamaha YDP223, we were surprised by the very natural keyboard feel. Yamaha calls this their Graded Hammer Technology (GH). In a nutshell, like a real piano, the weight of the keys on the bass side is heavier than on the treble side. The result? A fantastic feeling digital piano that articulates the nuances of your playing dynamics while building confidence. Now, for some specs: The Yamaha YDP223 has 14 different voices that range from pianos, electric pianos, organs, to a harpsichord, choirs, and, strings. The YDP223 has 64 voices of polyphony which mean the maximum number of simultaneous voices that can be played at once without any voices cutting out. For playing solo piano, 64 voices will be plenty however, if you have two voices layered, say strings and piano, then your maximum polyphony will be 32. The YDP223 also has 50 preset songs , timbre selector, reverbs, effects, touch control setting, music rest, . The heart of the Yamaha YDP223 is the piano sounds--and they are good. Yamaha used dynamic stereo sampling to achieve this by recording a real Yamaha concert grand at three different dynamic levels: soft, medium, and hard playing styles while capturing the stereo ambience. There are two acoustic piano programs on the YDP223: What is a Yamaha digital piano without the electric pianos? Yes, thankfully Yamaha added electric pianos too. They are quite expressive and playable. From hammer-struck metallic tines to FM synthesized electrics, you will instantly remember hearing the same pianos used in Pop, R&B, and Jazz styles. The Yamaha YDP223 also comes with a several organ programs that are great for Jazz and Church music, and among other voices including a vibraphone, a couple harpsichords, and choirs too. The YDP223 has a great feature for piano students. Fifty popular piano pieces from Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, etc are preloaded from the factory. When playing them back, you can mute the left or right hand parts so you can learn each part independently--this makes learning pieces a lot faster and easier. In addition, you can also set start and end points anywhere in any song, so, for example, say you've been having difficulty learning a particular phrase from Fur Elise. All you do is select Fur Elise and play it, then press the TEMPO/FUNCTION button at the start of the phrase you want to learn and press the TEMPO/FUNCTION button at the end of the phrase. This will set your start and end points and the YDP223 will now only play that segment and repeat it as many times you want. The Yamaha YDP223 gives you the ability to tweak your sounds. The REVERB button allows you to adjust the type of reverberation by selecting from a hall, room or stage--it gives you the feeling of playing the piano in one of these environments. The Yamaha YDP223 also has a touch control setting that changes the response of the keyboard from light, medium, to hard, an on-board metronome, transpose function, seven different scales to choose from, and a fine tuner to adjust the Yamaha YDP223's pitch in case you decide you want to play along with your favorite CD or another fellow musician. The best part of the Yamaha YDP223 is the piano sounds--they are so authentic and playable. They will inspire music to pour out of you. The other sounds are good but, it's the piano that makes the YDP223 sparkle. We didn't understand why Yamaha included a harpsichord program--maybe they were trying to appeal to Baroque music fans We definitely think this digital piano is a great choice for a music student--it will build confidence and inspiration and it's fun to learn the on-board songs. From the quality of sounds, to the touch of the keyboard, and its price tag, the Yamaha YDP223 is an outstanding value and would make a great home digital piano for a family.
