Omega Juicer
While I do eat fruit and vegetables, from everything I've read, I feel the health benefits of juicing are too great to pass up. Unless you are an impatient person, the Omega 8003 is great for a beginning juicer who wants a machine that not only handles apples, oranges and carrots, but won't get bogged down with wheatgrass, spinach and other leafy greens (wheatgrass is one of the harder plants to juice). Unlike a centrifugal juicer, which violently shreds what you put in it, the Omega 8003 uses what is known as a dual-screen, single auger to process produce into juice. That means it doesn't cut or chew as much as it mashes pulp forward into the end of a cone using the pressure of a spinning auger. The juice yield definitely trumps my old Braun centrifugal juicer, which can't handle wheatgrass. The pulp I get from the Omega is drier and if need be, I can easily put it back through for a tiny bit more juice. I put the pulp from the Braun into the Omega and actually got several extra tablespoons of juice!
Of all the machines I’ve , the Omega 8003 just crushes every piece of machinery, especially at this price. After eight months, I still use the juicer almost every other day and nothing has broken or malfunctioned. Juice extractors in general can be jet-engine loud. While the Omega’s motor is strong and hums with authority, I feel it’s killer quiet. I can easily juice in the early morning or night without waking the neighbors or my wife. It’s also not too large in size and the folding handle on top makes moving the machine around much easier than other machines. The construction is solid and Omega backs it up with 10-year warranty. Juicing itself is relatively subjective. Some people want to process lots of fruit and fast. While the Omega isn't as fast as some centrifugal juicers and while it can’t handle soft fruit (like bananas, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, etc) as well as other juicers, it does get the job done over and over. Plus, I really feel the juice quality is better. The only other juicer I think is in the same realm is the Green Star, which is harder to clean, bigger and almost twice the price! researched, tested and used
If you want the benefits of juicing, there is no way around having to spend some time cleaning the parts. Since the 8003 has only a few parts, it is by far the easiest and fastest juicer I’ve seen and tried to clean. Once you understand how the parts fit together, too, it's really a breeze to work with. You can also use the Omega as a food processor and grind coffee beans, flour, garlic, etc. There are also several attachments that come with the machine if you wish to make nut butters, baby food, frozen desserts, pasta and other things. I personally didn't buy it for any of that but maybe I'll end up using it for that later.
For those who are concerned about heat destruction of enzymes, the Omega’s auger turns slowly and doesn't appear to generate much noticeable heat. Granted the process of crushing and squeezing the vegetable matter through a small screen will cause friction, but I just don't feel it's as big a deal for the average user. That goes for oxidation as well. All juicers introduce some oxygen into the juice simply because of the mechanical process of extraction. With some fruits and vegetables, however, this machine does a noticeable job of reducing the amount of foam. Using carrots from the same bag, I juiced one in a centrifugal juicer and one in the Omega. There was a lot less foam with the Omega and the color of the juice was also darker and richer.
One caveat: the feeder chute is small in diameter, so it is best to cut up anything large to make it fit or be more manageable. Carrots are dense and I feel the machine fights with whole ones, but if you cut them up, it will do just fine, juice faster and put less stress on the machine.
Overall I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Omega 8003 juicer. I paid about $229 for mine, plus shipping. I felt that was a very reasonable price to start changing my life and health. The Omega 8005 juicer is the exact same machine as the 8003, but comes in a chrome finish.
