"Last week, I made a new pant using the first time your pattern 120F. I was completely hooked. I printed the pattern, cut it out, sewed the pants and without any trying-on, the pants fitted PERFECTLY. That's so great! I don't know other patterns who are so user-friendly. I added a sewed crease to the pants, and they look absolutely real!!"Silvana Baroffio, Switzerland

The Real Clothes patterns are designed to be easy to sew, easy to use, easy to modify.  Doll clothes should be as much fun to sew as they are to play with. They should challenge creativity and satisfy individual preferences.  Doll clothes for play need to be durable and attractive. For the people who customize dolls, the Real Clothes patterns can be used to create unique garments. Your fabrics, modifications to the basic patterns, hand finishing, and creative embellishment techniques can be incorporated to produce one-off couture fashions. The sewing instructions offer alternative construction methods and suggestions for design changes so you can make the clothes you visualize. The CD format means that you can print the pattern you want, ready to use, whenever you want . . . or ready for you to modify, without tracing or damaging the original pattern. Just insert the CD. install the software, and it's ready whenever you are.
