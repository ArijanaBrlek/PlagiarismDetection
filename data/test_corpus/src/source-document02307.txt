This classics compilation invites players to travel back in time to the early days of arcade and console games.

Faithfully reproduced from the original games, each emulated title includes the sights, sounds and action that made them so enduring. The collection includes 80 beloved arcade and Atari 2600 games, such as Asteroids, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Warlords and more.
Atari: 80 Classic Games in One gives you 80 titles – 62 of which were release on the Atari 2600. The games available give you a good variety and taste of all the classic titles of the day. Your standard Asteroids, Missile Command, Combat, and many others that you learned to love are all present in this bundle. Many of the titles are familiar and you played over and over with your old Atari console. Many of the other titles are not so familiar and fail to capture the essence of gaming in the era. Still others you'll find which weren't released, and you will see exactly why they weren't released – they aren't fun.
Each genre of game is broken down into an individual hub where gamers can check out both arcade and home came versions of these classics. As bonus features, gamers are offered comics, instruction manuals, catalogs, and updated visual modes, which allow higher res versions of the games, to features which distort gameplay to make the games more challenging.
As with any multi-title pack in one like this you'll be most excited about the games you know and love. Some of the hits that will make you want to fork out some cash include: Red Baron, Battlezone, Warlords, Missile Command, Pong, Super Breakout, Tempest, Centipede, and many others. The games that are fun and you remember really stand out and are really worth the budget price.
