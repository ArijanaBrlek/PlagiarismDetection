Why does it feel like you're getting nowhere fast? Hi. My name is Sharon Butler I have been studying the human body, body mechanics, and the effects of soft tissue injuries for over twenty years. I became especially interested in forearm pain and other repetitive strain injuries (RSI's) in 1991 when I developed forearm pain myself. I was just as worried about my injury as you are about yours. I was really lucky. Because of all the experience I had working with soft tissue injuries in my career, I was able to develop some really effective stretches and coping mechanisms. I was pain free in only 2 months. Then I started working with others who suffered from forearm pain too. I quickly discovered that for every case of forearm pain, the body's soft tissues (muscle, connective tissue, tendons) change to reflect how the body is used. So, your injury is reflecting how you've used your arms and hands for years leading up to now, making it unique to your body. I started researching, testing and tweaking my techniques. I made sure they worked on different body types and on people who had different occupations. The result was a set of powerful tools and strategies that people with forearm pain could use to get results quickly. After all that work, after all those hours, after testing all my techniques on my own body, I finally discovered the most interesting piece of all... You have a natural mechanism in your body that shows you the way, points to the place that needs help first, tells you how hard to stretch it, how long to stretch it, when to rest, and when to move on to another place. You've just forgotten how to use this skill. For years I taught forearm pain sufferers this natural skill and they got better really fast. I wanted the whole world to know this easy solution to their pain. My book, highlights this special, natural skill that I think is key to unraveling forearm pain. The book was an immediate best seller among books on Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI). It still is, 13 years later. Through the book, tens of thousands of people have discovered skills that get them out of pain fast. I knew there had to be more to the puzzle. I continued studying and testing. My new search lasted three more years and took hundreds of hours of work. The result? I found four drop-dead simple tools that get results even faster. These are tools that help you customize your stretches and they'll take you about 10 seconds to become expert at. How simple is that? And, combined with the stretches I've developed that really target forearm pain, I knew that more people would achieve successful results even faster than before. This was a quantum leap forward. I took all the best stretches and body mechanics information for forearm pain from my book and combined them with the four simple stretch-customizing techniques that I had developed and created the Forearm Pain Self Care Program. How would I get this information to the people who needed it the most? I had to come up with a solution that could help me reach anyone who was looking for help, anywhere in the world. That's when I turned to the Internet and began offering my Forearm Pain Self Care Program to readers who found my website. The Forearm Pain Self Care Program is a breakthrough in self-help for repetitive strain injuries. For the first time, people are provided with the exact information they need to create an effective recovery program for themselves. Nothing excites me more than hearing that people have gotten better, gotten back to their lives, and no longer fear losing their jobs because they followed my techniques. I'm absolutely delighted every time someone sends me an email or letter telling me of their success.

How I Found The Solution to Forearm Pain
Your Body Already Knows the Answer
So, I Wrote A Book
Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self Care Program
- Coco DuBois, Destin, FL"I'd only be repeating the praises others have given this book, but I just want to say I highly recommend this book. The stretches are explained clearly and simply and they do work. I've bought this book for friends and when they follow the exercises, they get relief. Another plus, is doing the stretches FEELS so good and it only takes maybe 15 minutes."
Having A Book On The Market Was Good But...
The Forearm Pain Self Care Program Was Born
It had to be affordable.
It had to be delivered fast.
It had to be in a format that was easy to follow.
- Hugh Denholm, Jomtien Beach, ThailandCase Study: Hugh Denholm
"I am 56 years old. I'm originally from the UK. "I retired last year and moved to Thailand so I could take up windsurfing again. I did no stretching either before or after surfing. "About 3 months ago I started to get a pain in my arms while I was sailing. I carried right on! It got progressively worse until I felt I was losing so much strength I could not hold the sail properly when I came out of the water. "I went to the local hospital where I was told that a muscle in my forearm had "seized up". I chose a course of muscle relaxants. I still had the pain. I finally decided I had to stop sailing (by this time I could not even lift a cup of coffee) and seek treatment. "I trawled the web to try and understand more of my condition. I found your site and a program targeted specifically at the forearm seemed worth a try!! Windsurfing is a key part of my life, it enhances me spiritually and physically and I wanted to do something to make myself better, rather thanseeking out doctors and medicines. This did seem like something that my own body should be able to cure rather than needing medicalassistance. "So the program arrived. I liked the concept that I needed to release muscles in other parts of the body before working on the forearm. I now realize another benefit is that it gets you to understand stretching, how it should feel, and how you create benefit and not damage. "Week Four included the full arm twist, and I could really feel that one working!! I finally felt a big difference in my forearm. The best word I can find to describe it is "looser", my arm just felt more free, and the pain was going away. Over the next few days it became progressively better so that by the end of the week, other than a little stiffness when I awoke, my arm felt fine again. "One day during Week Five my girlfriendcame in from sailing and I hopped on her board and went out for 15 minutes (having stretched beforehand). No pain, no problems!! Of course I stretched again when I came back. I am finishing Week Five now and plan to continue your stretches as part of my daily life. "Sharon, I don't know how long it would have taken me to get back on my windsurfer without your programme. But I do know that your approachhas helped me cure my own body in six weeks and I am deeply grateful to you. You have developed an intelligent, workable program whichreally delivers and I hope many more people around the world get to enjoy the same benefits. "I will now gradually work my way back into windsurfing. When the sun sets over the ocean after a good day on the water, I will raise a beer to you and say "Thank you Sharon for giving me back the sport I love!! "I wish you every success in the future."

-T. Slade, Norman, OK - A.Troffer, Denver, CO"I would like to see everyone in the world suffering from RSI give Sharon Butler programs a try. I think Sharon is the top expert in the world on how to teach people to recover from RSI using simple self-help techniques."
"For seven years I couldn work, cook, clean or hold a book. No "expert" among the 15 Medical Doctors and countless Physical Therapists I consulted was able to help me. Sharon Butler was the true RSI expert who helped me achieve recovery. When I first read her explanation of the role of fascia, poor posture and previous injury as critical factors in the development of RSI, I cried with relief because her principles made so much sense. Now, I am fully employed as a Technical Editor and use the computer extensively in my work. I maintain my wellness with periodic practice of a few of Sharon simple stretches! I discovered that even if your injury seems beyond hope, you truly can recover from RSI."
