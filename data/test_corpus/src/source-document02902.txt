Frequently Asked Questions
How much mechanical knowledge do I need to build a car myself?
Common sense is more important than previous knowledge. Quantums are designed with the home builder in mind, so only a very basic toolkit is assumed when preparing the kit. For instance, all holes over 10mm in diameter are drilled, and many fixing locations are scribe-marked into the mould - this ensures that every single car has tiny location markers in exactly the correct position.
What insurance group would a Quantum be in?
As with most specialist cars, there is no formal insurance grouping, and you may find that your usual broker is unsure of the car. However, there are a plethora of brokers who specialise in insuring specialist vehicles such as classic cars, 15+ year old sports cars, motorbikes and kit cars. Premiums are particularly competitive, usually cheaper than you would expect to be able to insure the original car from which your Quantum was built.
How do I go about getting my Quantum registered?
Once the car has been checked at the Single Vehicle Approval* examination, you contact your local Vehicle Registration Office (VRO). After completing two forms relating to the source of the parts for the car (i.e. the chassis/shell from Quantum and the rest from the car whose logbook (V5) you will need to present at this time), you are issued with the first tax disc for the car. You can drive the car as soon as you have had the number plates made, and receive the new V5 from DVLA Swansea a few weeks later. If your car is factory built, this will have been done for you.
...so, what is Single Vehicle Approval?
All cars must be Ministry approved. Production cars are 'Type Approved', involving crash testing etc. Cars of very low volume are approved via the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) scheme. Crash testing is obviously not feasible when the amateur 'manufacturer' builds only one car, so each builder takes their completed car to one of the designated HGV testing stations. The car is stringently inspected to check features such as brake ratios, interior design safety and external design. It is no more onerous than the annual MOT - it is just looking at different aspects, which are virtually all related to the design of the vehicle. For Quantums this is straightforward, and the current cost is 65.
How do I ensure when ordering parts that they will be compatible with my Quantum?
The Quantum is not a hybrid car - all mechanical parts are sourced from a single car, so you can re-order parts using the identity of the car around which the specification of your Quantum is based. The Quantum parts department carries a huge stock of parts, from minor fixings to entire engines, and anything we don't stock can usually be arranged for next day delivery.
How will my local garage service or repair a car as unusual and specialised as a Quantum?
Although your local garage may not have seen a Quantum before, a look under the bonnet, together with a brief explanation from yourself, will quickly give your mechanic his bearings. The car will be serviced exactly as the 'parent' Ford would be.
How can I get a finish like the demonstrators at the factory if I have standard gelcoat bodywork?
The inside surfaces of the Quantum moulds are polished to a mirror finish, hence the components produced are of such high quality. Whether for factory built cars, or home build kits, all fibreglass panels are fully machine polished to showroom standard before leaving the factory.
I don't want to source an old car - I want to build from as many new/clean parts as possible.
We supply a choice of both new and second hand components to complete any Quantum.
