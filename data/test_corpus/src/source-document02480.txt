Cholesterol aka Cholestrol
Substantially lower cholesterol naturally by diet, vitamins, herbs, spices and exercise.
s a past high cholesterol sufferer, when I got the news that I might live my life and die like my father did, I undertook an enormous amount of research to find out how to treat my high cholesterol by diet.
~ The Safer Alternative to Cholesterol Drugs ~
A
As a result, over the past several years, I have developed this cholesterol site into one which covers just about everything cholesterol.
Photo Picture of Cholesterol
This photo picture of cholesterol shows two vials: The clear vial of blood liquids is normal, but the other is a milky white because it is loaded with cholesterol.
Although you can't see the cholestrol looking at the blood directly, once the lab extracts the good stuff, you can see the dangerous cholesterol fat that's left behind that could be killing you.
Imagine having that stuff running through your car radiator - it would clog up fast, like your arteries and veins may eventually do with it.
Everything from pictures of cholesterol and it's symptoms, to diet, drugs, alternative medicines, to the value of animals to lowering and reducing cholesterol, to our own free cholesterol levels analysis, are all exhaustively covered.
We try to meet every need you may have in your search for understanding and controlling high cholesterol, by giving you this easy to read, easy to understand, indepth material, which is well researched with frequent updates to take into account new research.
Very seldom will high cholesterol lower of it's own accord. The typical outcome is for high cholesterol to just get worse, slowly and silently killing you as the months and years progress.
Education is your main defense against high cholesterol - without the knowledge to treat you cholesterol, you will most likely die, after, maybe, suffering several serious heart attacks and strokes, which may leave you more and more disabled each time.

2... High Cholesterol Kills and Maims
My father died about 30 years ago from cholesterol related cardiac disease, when I was just 21.  After a triple bypass operation, he had lasted another ten years, but was always weak and needing to rest.
Understanding and controlling cholesterol was new in his day.
Yes, he was advised to follow a low cholesterol diet - avoid foods high in cholesterol like butter and eggs, use margarine, eat fish, avoid fat - that was about the most they could tell him about lowering his cholesterol.
When I came down with high cholesterol, the doctors and dieticians gave me the same advice as my dad received - that didn't really help that much.
Let's face it, when you look round this cholesterol web site, you can understand why doctors and health professionals cannot possibly hope to impart the life saving information to you - the cholesterol information you need to succeed is enormous and many cholesterol sufferers will repeatedly come back to this site to gain more and more cholesterol information as they digest the earlier information they have obtained here.
How dangerous is dangerous when we talk about cholesterol and cardiac disease? Well, if you were to fall down dead in the street with cardiac arrest and if you were to be given immediate CPR, your chance of NOT being resuscitated is 90%. If you are lucky to be amongst the 10% who live, you run a 10% chance of remaining in the hospital for the rest of your life.
Cholesterol is deadly - very few people get a second chance when they ignore it or fail to control it. Controlling cholesterol is vitally important.
What you may not realise is that a cholesterol caused stroke could occur anywhere in your body.  If the cholesterol doesn't kill you, it can still be very disabling.  I saw a photo of foot that had had a stroke caused by cholesterol.  It looked yuk and the person may have been going to lose it.
People can lose their eyesight when cholesterol deposits build up in the blood vessels feeding the eyes.
Cholesterol is not a game, you may feel well, but it can still be doing it's thing...
 
3... The Cholesterol Induced Stroke:
One way cholesterol does it's bad thing is to build up on an artery wall, which narrows it. 
The cholesterol then becomes encapsulated by a fibrous deposit, which narrows the artery even further.  This cholesterol process alone can cause weakness and reduced blood flow to vital areas of your body, but what's worse, is if the fibrous deposit raptures / tears / breaks open.
  When these raptures occur, the body attempts to repair the break it then perceives in the artery wall, by creating a blood clot over the rupture - the blood vessels normally fix themselves like that - but with the cholesterol buildup on the artery wall, the fibrous coating that developed over the cholesterol deposits and the resultant narrowing of the artery at that point, the blood clot that is formed to repair the rapture, can block / close the artery, preventing blood flow.  This is called a stroke and this is the role that cholesterol can play in causing a stroke.
You may have heard about the cholesterol myth, hoax, great con, lie, but the truth is, it's hard to believe everything these people are saying, when you can see the cholesterol clogged arteries, see the results in strokes of body parts caused by cholesterol build up, see people suffering from blindness caused by excess cholesterol.  I wonder which is the cholesterol myth - perhaps the whole idea of the cholesterol myth is the hoax, with the ones perpetuating the idea of the myth making the money from book sales and the like.
  Yes!  Lower cholesterol to normal or better and the narrowed areas of the arteries caused by the cholesterol, even those cholesterol deposits that are grown over, will have the narrowing reduced by as much as 30% per year.  That is, the arteries will be less narrow and more normal in size.Does lowering cholesterol do anything for the cholesterol deposits already grown over?
What's more, after one year of lower cholesterol, the risk of stroke also is substantially reduced - it is much less likely that the blood vessel will rapture at the narrowing.
Well, now you have an idea as to why we control cholesterol, how cholesterol can lead to a stroke and hopefully to be motivated enough to do something about it, like read the rest of this web site!
Let's start with the essentials first - What is cholesterol?  How often should you have a cholesterol test?  What are the dangerous fats and why are they dangerous for people with high cholesterol?  When you have read our essential cholesterol information and the other sections on this page, you can find more indepth cholesterol information through our links on the left - we go into things in greater detail on our other pages - but this is an excellent page to start with.

4... UNDERSTANDING CHOLESTEROL:
The next simple step is to understand the different types of cholesterol - if we lower the wrong one we can kill ourselves, likewise, if we increase the wrong cholesterol, we can again kill ourselves.  Read on for ... 
The essential cholesterol information for understanding and victory
There is some confusion as to what cholesterol actually is
There is confusion even in the medical definitions of cholesterol given by universities and doctors. It is sometimes described as fat, other times it is defined as a fat like substance, sometimes as a waxy substance. What ever the actual definition, we can at least measure the cholesterol in the blood.
 
There are three basic cholesterols you need to know about.
VLDL refers to Very Low Density Lipoproteins. HDL is short for High-Density Lipoprotein, LDL refers to Low-Density Lipoprotein. The HDL cholesterol is referred to as the good cholesterol, the cholesterol we want lots of, while the LDL is portrayed as the bad cholesterol, that we need to keep low. HDL cholesterol also helps to clean the LDL cholesterol out of the blood.
How are the three cholesterols different from each other?
It's a matter of size - the VLDL cholesterol is large in comparison to the medium sized LDL cholesterol or the tiny HDL cholesterol.
A more medical explanation of the different types of cholesterol: VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are all composed of cholesterol, protein, and triglycerides. They are different from each other according to the ratio of the amount of cholesterol to protein to triglyceride. LDL is high in cholesterol. HDL is high in protein. VLDL is high in triglyceride.
Why does the type of the cholesterol matter so much? Why is the HDL cholesterol referred to as the good cholesterol? Why is LDL cholesterol referred to as the bad cholesterol?
LDL, HDL and VLDL actually refer to water soluable lipid protein chains that carry cholesterol around the body. Cholesterol is not water soluable, and will not circulate easily in the blood stream. In fact, cholesterol will drop out of the blood and onto vein and artery walls really fast. To overcome this, the body builds the lipid protein chains to carry it. Much the same as we build boats to traverse water.
Well, lipid protein chains are molecules that run round the blood system picking up cholesterol off vein and artery walls that it finds. When the lipid protein chain has collected the cholesterol, it is referred to as " HDL cholesterol".  is then jettisoned from the body tissues, it's size tells us it is earmarked so that the liver will eliminate this type of cholesterol from the body or convert it to bile. As HDL cholesterol will not be left to build up on arteries and so on and represents cholesterol being eliminated from the body, it is referred to as good cholesterol.the HDL HDL cholesterol
on the other hand is cholesterol ear marked for cell use and is carried by LDL lipid protein chains. LDL cholesterol is the necessary cholesterol moving through the blood stream to allow the body's cells to take as much cholesterol as they require for normal functioning. When there is too much bad LDL cholesterol in the blood, there is way too much for the cells to use, the bad LDL cholesterol remains in the blood, but while it is waiting to be used, it may deposit onto artery walls and so on where it then becomes a health hazard increasing the risk of cardiovascular accidents - for this reason, this necessary cholesterol is referred to as the bad cholesterol, even though, in moderation, it is beneficial to us.Bad LDL cholesterol
There is another cholesterol that has been identified as a bad cholesterol and that is   Lp(a) is a type of LDL cholesterol and has been found to be linked to cardiovascular disease.  This particular type of LDL cholesterol is apparently easily controlled by vitamin C.  See our page on the to learn more about this particular type of .Lp(a) cholesterol. cholesterol myth LDL cholesterol
, the high triglyceride cholesterol, is also considered a bad cholesterol. The main role of VLDL cholesterol is to act as a storage device for excess calories that cannot be used straight away. When the excess calories are converted to VLDL cholesterol, the VLDL cholesterol is then taken up by the fat cells. When there is more VLDL cholesterol circulating in the blood than the fat cells can immediately take out, it becomes a problem for the cardiovascular system, in much the same way as LDL cholesterol does.VLDL cholesterol
 
When should blood cholesterol levels be checked?
If you are over 20 years of age, it is recommended that you have both your HDL bad cholesterol and LDL good cholesterol checked every five years, along with your triglyceride level - most triglycerides are VLDL cholesterols. The actual levels considered normal or beneficial have been changing over the years, so it is best to check with a doctor about whether your particular levels are high or not, but we have included an to assist you. ALL ABOUT CHOLESTEROL LEVELS WEB PAGE
 
There are several types of fats you need to know about in relation to improving blood cholesterol levels.
Why are some fats bad for cholesterol and other fats considered to be good for cholesterol?
Unsaturated fatty acids ( plant fats ), such as polyunsaturates and monounsaturates are considered the "good" fats to have in your diet because they don't increase your blood cholesterol directly, while saturated fatty acids ( animal fats ) and trans fats ( which is a type of fat sometimes formed during food processing ) are considered the "bad" fats to have in your diet - bad because they increase the bad cholesterol ....
More about Trans Fats / Trans Fatty Acids and Cholesterol
Trans fats have been found to be the most dangerous fat for cholesterol levels to date. Trans Fats raise total cholesterol levels, raise the LDL bad cholesterol and lower the HDL good cholesterol. It is believed trans fats can double the risk of coronary disease in women through it's effect on cholesterol.
Trans fats are intentionally made in our foods - hydrogen gas reacts with oil under pressure in food processing to form the trans fats which increase the shelf life of the product.
Trans fats can be found in cookies / biscuits, crackers, icing, potato chips / crisps, corn chips, margarine, microwave popcorn.
Unfortunately, for trying to control cholesterol, trans fats and the amount of trans fats are not normally shown in the ingredients listed on products.
However, on a cholesterol controlled diet, these products - except for perhaps small amounts of margarine - are seldom consumed. So for those of us with a cholesterol problem, our low cholesterol diets protect us from them anyway - which is a big relief for the high cholesterol sufferer !
