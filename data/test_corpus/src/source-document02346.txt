Planning a bachelor party should center around the personality of the bachelor. Is he fun and outgoing or is he more quiet and prefer not to be in the spotlight? Also, with the traditional bachelor party, would he be comfortable with the more risque, or would it be offensive? These are all important questions which will determine the success of your bachelor party.
You can choose activities centered at home, or out in the community. Community gathering places include the traditional restaurant and bars. Increasingly popular are creative outings such as sporting events, camping, and amusement parks.
The groomsmen typically pay for the bachelor party. It is also acceptable for everyone attending the bachelor party to chip in.
Typically, the bachelor party consists of the closest friends and family members, so it shouldn't be a problem sharing the costs. Also be sure to arrange for a limo or hotel room if everyone will be drinking up for a lively celebration!
Bachelor parties are associated with strip clubs and limo rides. There are also many creative "PG-13" ideas to make it fun for all!Activity Ideas
Here are some activity ideas:
Roast the bachelor. Include all kinds of funny memories and embarassing videos or photos!
Is the bachelor known for any particular hobby or activity? How about an all-inclusive sport such as golfing, paintball games, or laser tag? It may have better participation than if the bachelor is known for sky diving or extreme sports!
Gambling on a winner? Choose a casino night for an easy to put together bachelor party.
Take the guys to a sporting event complete with beer and dogs
A western theme can be used to "wrangle" the bachelor into marriage. Decorate with "wanted" posters of the bachelor or bachelorette. Give a lasso as a prop to the bachelorette as a metaphor for "roping" her man to the alter!
Create a time capsule to be opened in five years. Include some of her cherished pre-marriage items and a questionnaire about what he thinks marriage will be like. For example, "Who (bachelor or bachelorette) will there be "more of to love (weight gain)" in five years?" Make a video of the party to include in his time capsule.
Board games or card game championships
Hold a couples party and play the Newlywed Game to see who's most in tune with each other.
Murder mystery party with a honeymooning script. Purchase murder mystery scripts or use a local murder mystery company to host the event.
Take a day cruise on a local body of water.
Have a pig roast for the guys only or include the bridal party as well.
Go out dancing at the bachelor's favorite club.
