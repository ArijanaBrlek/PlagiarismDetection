There are many  dial-up internet service providers out there.  How do you chose the one that is best for you- it can be overwhelming.  What features do you need?   Here are some of the things you want to consider when you are looking for an inexpensive isp.
Connections Speed
 The speed of your connection will determine how fast pages load while surfing and how fast you can download programs and email.  Connecting via a dial-up is slower than DSL.   Make sure your modem has a connection speed of at least 56k. The latest dial-up modems are called V.92.  Those with V.92 modems can enjoy a bit better connection speed, and also take advantage of "modem on hold", which works in conjunction with call waiting -this lets you to connect to the internet and accept telephone calls at the same time.  Not all access numbers are V.92 compatible, so you'll want to check for those when you pick a dial-up number if you wish to take advantage of these features.
Access Numbers
One of the first things you need to do check to see if there is a local access number (and maybe even multiple local numbers)  so you will not have to pay long distance charges. If the provider does not have a local access number, you could end up paying a lot of money in telephone charges.  The best bet is to chose a national provider which have thousands of numbers nationwide and there is also less chance of a busy signal.  
Email 
How many email accounts do they offer?  Some offer only 1, some offer up to 5 or more.   If they offer only 1 email account, you can still get a free email account from hotmail or yahoo.   You may also want to check to see if they offer a spam filter.  
Price
Many National Internet Service Providers have monthly unlimited service starting at $9.95.  Cheap ISP are more than 1/2 half of the cost of large name ISP. Over a year this can save you more than $150.   Also check out whether you are signing a contract for a year.  So consider using a budget priced internet service provider if meets your requirements.
Technical Support
Is technical support opened 24 hours a day?  Do they have a toll-free number? Or it is a long distance call for you.
