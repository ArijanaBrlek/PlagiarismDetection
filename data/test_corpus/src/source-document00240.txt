Flushing Council partners with schools and local community organizations in the development of arts-in-education programs that will spark interest in the arts and enhance learning in all academic areas. We currently partner with the NYC Department of Education, the Center for Arts Education, the New York State Council on the Arts and NYC Department for Youth and Community Development to bring arts programs into schools. Through a grant from the New York State Council for the Arts, Flushing Council partners with JHS 189 to produce a multi-media performance based on students' adaptation of a familiar piece of literature. This year-long project engages students in several academic areas including visual arts, music, and language arts. They work with their teachers to adapt a script, develop a storyboard, digitize the story, write lyrics and integrate a live musical theatre repertoire into the final production. As result of working on this project, students report that they learned to work as team members and that they are more analytical in making choices. New York City Department of Education Project ARTS funds also make this project possible. Flushing Council also provides experienced teaching artists in visual arts, literary arts, music and dance who will work with teachers and administrators to plan appropriate instructional projects and activities, provide direct services to children, conduct parent workshops, and work with teachers in professional development sessions devoted to curriculum writing and creation of projects. We are partnering with PS 22 in a Parents as Arts Partners grant provided by the Center for Arts Education. The Parents as Arts Partners program provides an opportunity for schools and cultural organizations to engage parents and/or families in hands-on, interactive arts education activities. Flushing Council's teaching artist, Tina Seligman, is working with parents at PS 22 to design and paint a permanent mural for the school that celebrates its multi-cultural diversity. Flushing Council recently received Cultural After School Adventures (CASA) grants to provide cultural programming for students enrolled in after school programs. The funding for this program is provided by the New York City Council in partnership with the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Department for Youth and Community Development.Â  It gives an opportunity for non-profit organizations and DYCD Out-of-School-Time (OST) providers to offer cultural experiences to our City's youth.
