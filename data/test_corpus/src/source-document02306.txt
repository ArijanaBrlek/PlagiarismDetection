The sites contain hundreds of photographs, panoramic images, time-lapse videos, and other multimedia components. This project is a collaboration between NASA's Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum, the National Park Service at Chaco Canyon, INAH and UNAM in Mexico, and Ideum, a multimedia design firm located in Corrales, New Mexico.
