Qourum Seleccion
Posted on November 25th, 2004 by Shane
I haven’t had a site stand out like this to me in a while, in fact this week in general was a great week for sites that just set themselves apart from everyone else. When you show me a site with neutral colors, you can’t go wrong. I think I have made a reputation for myself of using neutrals and pastels. They are easy on the eyes and I like to see them. Aside from this the site just looks different, and it looks pretty damn good. Love the simplicity, while still being complex looking in areas. I haven’t seen anything done like this, but if you actually take a look at the code it is all lists. The style part, that’s not a big deal. However, if the name of this site was unmatched accessibility, this would not even be in the ballpark. Via:
