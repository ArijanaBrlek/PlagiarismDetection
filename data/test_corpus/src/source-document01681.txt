At Home Workout Tips
Nothing beats the convenience of at home workouts. You save time and money, while losing more weight than those who workout in health clubs. A University of Florida research study found that home-based exercisers lost 10 pounds more than those who exercised in gyms. But what if you're home workout is not working? Here are the quick and easy at home workout tips you need to get results. Pick your workout program or plan then gather the equipment you will need for that plan and place it in a bin or basket near the area where you will be working out. Now gather your shoes, music, and attire and place in a separate bin in a visible place. When you have everything organized you save time and burn more calories because you're not running around the house looking for your gear before and during your workout. When you finish take 5 minutes to pack everything back in the bins. If you were training at a gym you would have a general time that you would try to get there. Working out at home should be the same. Set a time that works with your schedule (that may vary from day to day) then set an alarm 15 and 10 minutes before your workout. You can use your iphone, outlook calendar, watch, or clock. I set two alarms just to make sure I'm not tempted to skip. The enforcer is a person who can keep you honest without making you feel bad if you don't stick to your plan. It could be your spouse, a friend, your co-workers, members of an online community like diet.com, or an online workout partner. Discuss your plan then report to them daily or weekly. Knowing that you have to tell somebody whether you worked out or skipped a workout boosts compliance. My accountability partner is my boyfriend and my readers at www.freeworkoutsguide.com Try not to multi-task while you're working out. This can lead to injuries and can cut your calories burned in half. You are better off zoning in on a challenging workout for 10-20 minutes than going back and forth between workout, phone, cooking, and handling people's issues for 60 minutes. Your kids and partner can take care of themselves especially if you tell them that you are not available for another 20 minutes. Empower them to leave you alone and they'll find stuff to do and solve their own problems for a change.
