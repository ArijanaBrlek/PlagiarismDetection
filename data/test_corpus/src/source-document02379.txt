New Superior Poolside Rooms offer resort-style comfort 'above the beach' on Rincon's Rt. #413
Rooms and Rates - the best selection & value in Rinc√≥n
The Lazy Parrot Inn and mini-Resort has a great selection of rooms and rates to suit your budget and personal style. All rooms offer air conditioning, ceiling fans, private bath, satellite 'Dish Network' TV with 100 channels, clock, microwave, mini-fridge and our Continental Breakfast Buffet. Free Wi-Fi internet access is available in our main poolside lobby.
Family owned and operated since 1989, our friendly small Caribbean country inn has been a favorite of adventurous travelers to Puerto Rico for over two decades. We have many guests that return year after year - but we are not right for everyone.
If you are expecting the same accommodations and services you would find at at Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton or other major hotel chain - The Lazy Parrot may not be for you. However, if you want a truely Caribbean 'small hotel' experience within a few minute's drive to everything Rincon has to offer - we may be the perfect choice for your stay in Rincon.
