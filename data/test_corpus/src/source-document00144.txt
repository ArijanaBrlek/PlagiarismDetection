Two former Michigan Public Media employees pleaded no contest to charges that they embezzled meals, money and Persian rugs, among other goods and services.
Michael Coleman, former deputy director of the Ann Arbor pubcaster operated by the University of Michigan and now g.m. of WDET-FM in Detroit, agreed May 18 [2006] to a reduced misdemeanor charge of embezzlement under $200. He could receive up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine when he’s sentenced June 22. He will pay $3,500 restitution, according to the .Ann Arbor News
The original charge was embezzling less than $20,000, a felony punishable with a 5-year sentence and fine of at least $10,000.
Coleman will keep his job at WDET, according to reps from license holder Wayne State University. 
“We are looking forward to continuing the momentum we are seeing at WDET under Michael’s leadership,” said Louis Lessem, interim executive v.p. of the university, in a statement.
Justin Ebright, former development director, pleaded to the original charge April 12. He was sentenced May 18 to two years’ probation, 50 hours of community service and $10,000 restitution, according to the .

A third defendant, Jeremy Nordquist, will face embezzlement charges in a July 24 trial, according to the Washtenaw County prosecutor’s office. Nordquist has maintained that he didn’t knowingly break any laws.
The prosecutor filed charges March 15 after a University of Michigan internal audit found underwriting irregularities in Michigan Public Media’s radio division.
The university found its pubcasting unit lost more than $50,000 in underwriting revenues to in-kind trades involving massages, airline tickets, a pool table and a lawn sprinkler system, among other perks, that did not benefit the station. At the time, Coleman told that he had done nothing wrong and was “confident that I’ll be vindicated through this process.”

He declined to comment last week about why he opted to take a plea. Asked if he acknowledged any wrongdoing on his part, he replied simply, “No.”
“I’m quite excited about putting this behind me,” he said.
