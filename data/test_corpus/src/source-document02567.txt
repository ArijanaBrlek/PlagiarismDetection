About Me
I am a professional chef, who trained with renowned restaurateur Prue Leith before setting up a successful catering business offering distinctive food, at affordable prices but with exceptional style and visual look. My quest to improve the quality of Jewish cooking led to a number of highly successful 'hands-on' cookery demonstrations all over the country and a commission to write two books that have established me as the leading name in modern kosher stylish cooking. Modern Jewish Food with Style and The Book of Jewish Cooking enabled me to broaden my appeal both in the UK and abroad. My third book, The Jewish Mamma’s cookbook was published in Autumn 2005 and my new book 'Flavours of The Jewish Table' published by Ebury Press is now available via this website.
I also write regular cookery columns for Jewish newspapers from London to Toronto and New York, member of the Food Writers Guild, broadcast on the radio (including my own show on Jcom Radio 101.4 FM), lectures at charity and other events in the UK and teach in London at my own Cookery school and also in New York (Institute of Culinary Education, the Sephardic Centre, Brooklyn and the JCC- the Jewish Community Centre.) My TV appearances have included ITV, Channel 5, Carlton Food Channel and UK Food, where my modern approach to designer recipes has won me much acclaim.
My practical approach to even the most complex of recipes makes learning fun, and my recipes will enhance any occasion, from formal family meal to Sunday brunch. Although strictly kosher, I am constantly seeking to ensure that being Jewish does not limit our ability to enjoy food, or keep up with the latest trends.
I am passionate in my belief that the creation of modern, stylish dishes should not be beyond the capabilities of the average person and although my ingredients may be readily available in any supermarket, the finished dishes would grace any quality restaurant table.
With three young children and an active lifestyle, I always ensures that my recipes fit around the needs of the family and a busy schedule.
So whether you attend one of my courses obtain one of my books or join a demonstration, you sure that your cooking skills will be greatly enhanced.
So what does Denise really like and dislike ?
Likes
Italian food is definitely a weakness especially risotto and traditional thick vegetable soup – La Ribillata - for which I have a very special recipe of my own. I love sea bass with mash potato and like all true foodies, fine wine and chocolate is definitely a must! And of course all my own recipes as I can not cook anything I don’t like to eat!
Dislikes
Taramasalata, steak and the smell of kippers certainly never tempt me. Cooked breakfast and any dessert laden with cream will never twist my arm. Ketchup is certainly on the no no list except when I was pregnant and now my youngest son has every meal covered in it!
