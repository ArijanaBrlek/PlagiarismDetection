From the Founders
We founded Home & Garden Party in May 1996 because it was our desire to provide others the opportunity to succeed in business.  The Lord had blessed us financially through other business ventures, and we have always believed that to whom much is given, much is expected.   Our goal continues to be to provide our Designers, Hostesses and Customers with outstanding service.  We believe Home & Garden Party has the best people, the best products and the best pay!
Sincerely, Penny and Steve Carlile
 
 
More than 28,000 Independent Designers Are Paid to Party! MARSHALL, Texas  Penny and Steve Carlile have been a team almost their whole lives, first as high school and college sweethearts, then returning to their hometown of Marshall, Texas, to raise their two sons. Steve became a partner in his familys oil and gas business. After the business was sold, Penny and Steve both believed that along with financial blessings comes the obligation to share by helping others. They decided to create a business that would employ people in Marshall and provide an outlet for their creativity and business savvy. First, they bought a pottery company, since local artisans already had a reputation for quality craftsmanship that drew customers to East Texas. Next, they developed retail stores that sold pottery and home decorations. Soon, they wondered how they could share their dream with more people in more places. Steve found the answer in a Wall Street Journal article about a family-owned direct sales business based in a small Midwest town. We already had a successful product line. I could see that selling in homes instead of in retail stores would allow people to set their own hours, without the overhead costs of retail space, inventory and employees. That would mean more flexibility and more income potential  a perfect solution to help families everywhere. Steves wife, Penny, chimes in. We saw this concept could expand our business in the very best way, by providing an opportunity to others who in turn could become successful from their own home base. Together, Steve and Penny talked to people who had sold for direct sales companies, asking what worked and what should change. They began to create a model for a people-oriented business that would provide individuals with the best possible products, tools and training along with a generous commission structure that would rival any other. They chose the name Home & Garden Party to bring a picture to mind  an informal gathering in a home or garden with wonderful decorations, artwork and greenery. And since the very first party in May, 1996, thats just what guests see when a hostess opens her home to friends to learn about the company, purchase products, and plan future parties. Independent Designers create attractive displays, share ideas to add warmth and interest to any home, and they get paid to party! No lecture, no flip chart. Just a chance to learn, laugh, and enjoy shopping from the items displayed or hundreds more featured in the catalog. Home & Garden Party offers high-quality products to enliven any home, including stoneware pottery, candles and fragrance lamps, framed art, florals, bakeware and accessories for both home and garden. Because of their retail experience, Steve and Penny have an eye for what consumers will buy, and they know how important it is to maintain high quality standards with reasonable prices. When visitors arrive at company headquarters in East Texas, they cant help but notice a large warehouse that dominates the property. Inside, an automated order picking system and almost 300 employees fill more than 7,000 orders every day. Home & Garden Party made a substantial investment in the system after a best-selling holiday season in 1998 resulted in backorders, unshipped products, and substantial losses. We certainly did not intend to create the situation, which really resulted from too much growth, too fast, Penny admits. But we vowed that it would never happen again! Providing the best possible customer service along with value and convenience is front and center among the companys goals. Steve adds, We see no reason why we cant provide the best in everything. The best people, the best products, and the best pay for our independent Designers. The company has recruited a number of top-level executives to enjoy the smalltown atmosphere of Marshall while building a powerhouse business. Penny and Steve are particularly grateful that both of their sons have chosen to move back to Marshall with their families to work at Home & Garden Party. Steve says, We started this business to help families, and we feel so blessed that our own family has found a reason to live and work together in Marshall. Penny is President of Home & Garden Party, with Steve holding the titles of CEO and Chairman. Together, these lifetime partners want to give the same sense of shared independence to others. According to Penny, We consider it an honor and privilege to serve our Designers, and we want to see their personal and professional dreams become a reality just as ours have. Home & Garden Party offers a unique combination of decorating products, training, compensation and marketing support to more than 28,000 independent Designers across the United States. Home & Garden Party is a proud member of the Direct Selling Association, upholding the highest standards for the industry with a culture of integrity, caring and superior service.HOME & GARDEN PARTY FOUNDERS SHARE THEIR SUCCESS
