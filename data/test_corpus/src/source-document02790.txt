These are the rules.  Pass the Trash Draw Poker is also known as Anaconda poker.Pass the Trash Draw Poker
In Pass the Trash Draw Poker, seven cards are dealt to each poker player.  Before the first round, each player examines his poker hand, and removes exactly three cards from his poker hand and places them on the table to his left.  After each player has thus discarded, each player then picks up the cards discarded by his right-hand neighbor and places them in his poker hand (thus, each poker player will have given three cards to his left-hand neighbor).  It is important that each poker player discard before looking at the cards he is to receive.  poker betting
In Pass the Trash Draw Poker, there is then a poker betting round after the first pass.  Then a second pass occurs, each poker player passing two cards to his right.  A second poker betting round is followed by a third pass, each player passing one card to his left.  Finally, a fourth betting round and a showdown, in which the poker player with the best five card high poker hand he can make out of the seven cards in his hand wins the pot.
In some truly silly Pass the Trash poker games, the showdown is replaced by a rollout phase, as described in .  This makes a total of eight betting rounds in the poker game, which generally destroys any chance for skillful play in the later rounds. Shotgun Poker
