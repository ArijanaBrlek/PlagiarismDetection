Jim Commentucci/The Post-StandardJason Wright's gingerbread replica of the Brewster Inn, in Cazenovia, includes details like snow on the roof and smoke billowing from the chimneys.
If you felt challenged baking a couple dozen gingersnaps or gingerbread cut-outs this holiday season, imagine how Jason Wright feels.
Each year at this time, Wright, the executive chef at the Brewster Inn, orders extra supplies of flour, sugar, eggs and food coloring so he can make a gingerbread replica of the historic inn overlooking Cazenovia Lake.
Wright says he starts the project around Halloween because Christmas comes fast and it takes him about 160 hours to bake, build and embellish the gingerbread structure with marzipan and royal icing. The finished product measures about 3.5 feet long by 2 feet high.

The inn's guests enjoy seeing the inn in miniature, and if your travels take you to Cazenovia, you can check it out, too. Wright's work of gingerbread art will be on display at the Brewster for another month or more.
The Brewster Inn is at 6 Ledyard Ave. (just off Route 20, walking distance to the village). For information, call 655-9232 or go to . www.thebrewsterinn.com
