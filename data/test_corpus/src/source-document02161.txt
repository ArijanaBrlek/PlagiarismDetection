WELCOME TWO NEW CHAPTERS!
It is always wonderful to share good news. I am pleased to announce the establishment of two new state chapters of the Forest Fire Lookout Association: Indiana and Louisiana. Both are lead by U.S. Forest Service people. Teena Ligman is the Public Affairs Specialist for the Hoosier National Forest. Mark Gutzman is a District Archaeologist on the Kitsatchie National Forest. Indiana once had 32 fire towers, and 10 remain. There is one remaining on the Hoosier National Forest next to the Charles Deam Wilderness, and the other nine are on various Indiana State Forests. One of those on the Clark State Forest has been restored and four more are scheduled to be restored soon. One of the early tasks of the new Indiana group will to locate the remains of the other 22 fire towers and determine if they are still standing on private land or have been removed and stored or relocated somewhere else. The Kitsatchie National Forest has just completed the restoration of the historic Mosley Hill Lookout and relocation to a former CCC site near the Ranger Station. It had to be moved because of a highway widening project. There are still quite a number of fire towers in Louisiana, most state facilities and many located near ranger unit offices. Louisiana once had 200 fire towers and about 25 remain, mostly in the southern half of the state.INDIANA AND LOUISIANA

For those of you in the Pacific Northwest, why not plan to attend the meeting? These meetings are always fun, and Oregon Director Howard Verschoor has interesting field visits planned for Sunday. Our meetings are open and everyone is welcome!ANNUAL MEETING
