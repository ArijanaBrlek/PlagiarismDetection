Overview
Cervical cancer starts in a woman's cervix, which is the lower, narrow part of the uterus. The uterus holds the growing fetus during pregnancy. The cervix connects the lower part of the uterus to the vagina and, with the vagina, forms the birth canal.
Cervical cancer develops when normal cells on the surface of the cervix begin to change, grow uncontrollably, and eventually form a mass of cells called a tumor. A tumor can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
At first, the changes in a cell are abnormal, not cancerous. Researchers believe, however, that some of these abnormal changes are the first step in a series of slow changes that can lead to cancer. Some of the abnormal cells go away without treatment, but others can become cancerous. This phase of the disease is called dysplasia (an abnormal growth of cells). The precancerous tissue needs to be removed to keep cancer from developing. Often, the precancerous tissue can be removed or destroyed without harming healthy tissue, but in some cases, a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and cervix) is needed to prevent cervical cancer. Treatment of a lesion (a precancerous area) depends on the following factors:
How big the lesion is, and what type of changes have occurred in the cells
If the woman wants to have children in the future
The woman's age
The woman's general health
The preference of the woman and her doctor
If the precancerous cells change into true cancer cells and spread deeper into the cervix or to other tissues and organs, the disease is then called cervical cancer.
There are two main types of cervical cancer, named for the type of cell where the cancer started.
Squamous cell carcinoma, which makes up about 80% to 90% of all cervical cancers
Adenocarcinoma, which makes up 10% to 20% of all cervical cancers
In addition, there are a few other rare types of cervical cancer.
Statistics
In 2008, an estimated 11,070 women in the United States will be diagnosed with cervical cancer. It is estimated that 3,870 deaths from the disease will occur this year. The number of new cases of cervical cancer is decreasing as screening with the Pap test (see ) becomes more prevalent. The number of cervical cancer deaths continues to decrease each year. Prevention
The one-year relative survival rate (percentage of patients who survive at least one year after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other diseases) of women with cervical cancer is 88%. The five-year relative survival rate (percentage of patients who survive at least five years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other diseases) for all stages of cervical cancer is 72%. When detected at an early stage, the five-year survival rate for women with invasive cervical cancer is 92%.
Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States each year, but the actual risk for a particular individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a woman how long she will live with cervical cancer. Because the survival statistics are measured in five-year (or sometimes one-year) intervals, they may not represent advances made in the treatment or diagnosis of this cancer.

Risk Factors
A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing cancer. Some risk factors can be controlled, such as smoking, and some cannot be controlled, such as age and family history. Although risk factors can influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. However, knowing your risk factors and communicating them to your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health-care choices.
The following factors may raise a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer:
The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is infection with HPV. This virus is passed from one person to another during sexual intercourse. Factors that raise the risk of being infected with HPV include becoming sexually active at an early age, having many sexual partners (or having sex with a man who has had many partners), and/or having sex with a man who has penile warts.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Women with lowered immune systems have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. A lowered immune system can be caused by immune suppression from corticosteroid medications, kidney transplantations, or treatments for other types of cancer or from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). When a woman is infected with HIV, her immune system is less able to fight off early cancer.Immune system deficiency.
Women who have genital herpes have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer.Herpes.
Women who smoke are about twice as likely to develop cervical cancer as women who do not smoke.Smoking.
Girls younger than 15 rarely develop cervical cancer. The risk goes up between the late teens and mid-30s. Women over 40 remain at risk and need to continue having regular Pap test screenings.Age.
Cervical cancer is more common among black women, Hispanic women, and American Indian women.Race.
Some research studies suggest that oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, may be associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer, but more research is needed to understand how oral contraceptive use and the development of cervical cancer are connected.Oral contraceptives.
Women whose mothers were given this drug during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage are at increased risk for cervical cancer. DES was given for this purpose from about 1940 to 1970. Women exposed to DES should have an annual pelvic examination that includes a cervical Pap test as well as a four-quadrant Pap test, in which samples of cells are taken from all sides of the vagina to check for abnormal cells.Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES).

Prevention
Cervical cancer can often be prevented by preventing precancers and having regular Pap tests. Preventing precancers means controlling these risk factors.
Delaying first sexual intercourse until the late teens or older
Limiting the number of sex partners
Avoiding sexual intercourse with people who have had many partners
Avoiding sexual intercourse with people who are obviously infected with genital warts or show other symptoms
Having safe sex by using condoms will reduce the risk of HPV infection. Condoms also protect against HIV and AIDS.
Quitting smoking
The is the most common test for cervical cancer. Researchers have found that combining it with a test to detect HPV provides the most accurate results. In 2003, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel recommended that Pap tests and HPV tests be used together when screening for cervical cancer in women over the age of 29. The HPV test is already being used as a secondary test in people with Pap test results that indicate abnormal cells are present. Pap test
In 2006, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was approved by the FDA for girls and women between ages 9 and 26. It prevents infection by the four most common strains (types) of HPV. The vaccine does not protect people who are already infected with HPV. Doctors still recommend regular Pap tests using the guidelines below for all women. For more information on the HPV vaccine, read the . ASCO Expert Corner: HPV Vaccination for Cervical Cancer
In 2003, the American Cancer Society, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, and the U.S. Preventive Task Force developed screening guidelines with the Pap test for cervical cancer.
All women should begin having yearly Pap tests within three years of beginning vaginal sexual intercourse, but no later than age 21.
Women should be screened annually with a conventional Pap test or every two years with liquid-based tests. Women with three consecutive normal test results can lengthen their screening intervals to every two to three years. Women with specific medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, should be screened more often.
Women over the age of 70 can discontinue screening if their previous three Pap tests were normal and there were no abnormal test results within the previous 10 years. However, women with certain medical conditions, such as HIV infection, should continue routine screening.
Screening after a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and cervix) is not necessary unless the surgery was done to treat cervical cancer or precancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy without removal of the cervix should continue screening until age 70.

Symptoms
Women with cervical cancer may experience the following symptoms. Sometimes, women with cervical cancer do not show any of these symptoms. Or, these symptoms may be caused by a medical condition that is not cancer.
Most women do not have any signs or symptoms of a precancer or early stage cervical cancer. Symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer has spread to other tissues and organs.
Any of the following could be signs or symptoms of cervical dysplasia or cancer:
Blood spots or light bleeding between or following periods
Menstrual bleeding that is longer and heavier than usual
Bleeding after intercourse, douching, or a pelvic examination
Pain during sexual intercourse
Bleeding after menopause
Increased vaginal discharge
Any of these six symptoms should be reported to the doctor. If these symptoms appear, it is important to talk with your doctor about them even if they appear to be symptoms of other, less serious conditions. The earlier precancerous cells or cancer is found and treated, the better the chance that the cancer can be prevented or cured.

Diagnosis
Doctors use many tests to diagnose cancer and determine if it has metastasized (spread). Some tests may also determine which treatments may be the most effective. For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of cancer. If a biopsy is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis. Imaging tests may be used to find out whether the cancer has metastasized. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:
Age and medical condition
The type of cancer suspected
Severity of symptoms
Previous test results
In addition to a physical examination, the following tests may be used to diagnose cervical cancer:
The doctor gently scrapes the outside of the cervix and vagina and takes samples of the cells for testing. For more information, read .Pap test. Pap Test  What to Expect
In this examination, the doctor feels a womans uterus, vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, bladder, and rectum to check for any unusual changes. A Pap test is often done at the same time.Pelvic examination.
If the doctor finds abnormal changes to the cervix during a pelvic examination and a Pap test, the doctor may test for HPV. An HPV test is similar to a Pap test, where the test is done on a sample of cells from the patients cervix. Certain strains (kinds) of HPV, such as HPV 16, are seen more often in women with cervical cancer and may help confirm a diagnosis. Many women carry HPV, so HPV testing alone is not an accurate test for cervical cancer. But if the Pap tests show some cellular abnormality, and the HPV test is also positive, the doctor may suggest one or more of the following diagnostic tests:
The doctor may do a colposcopy to check the cervix for abnormal areas. A special instrument called a colposcope (an instrument that magnifies the cells of the cervix and vagina, similar to a microscope) is used. The colposcope gives the doctor a lighted, magnified view of the tissues of the vagina and the cervix. The colposcope is not inserted into the womans body and the examination is not painful, can be done in the doctor's office, and has no side effects. It can be done on pregnant women.Colposcopy.
A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. Other tests can suggest that cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definite diagnosis. The sample removed from the biopsy is analyzed by a pathologist (a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and diagnosing disease). If the lesion is small, the doctor may remove all of it during the biopsy. There are several types of biopsies:Biopsy.
One common method uses an instrument to pinch off small pieces of cervical tissue.
Sometimes, the doctor wants to check an area inside the opening of the cervix that cannot be seen during a colposcopy. To do this, the doctor uses a procedure called endocervical curettage (ECC). Using a small, spoon-shaped instrument called a curette, the doctor scrapes a small amount of tissue from inside the cervical opening.
A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) uses an electrical current passed through a thin wire hook. The hook removes tissue for examination in the laboratory. A LEEP may also be used to remove a precancer or an early stage cancer.
Conization (a cone biopsy) removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix. Conization may be done as treatment to remove a precancer or an early stage cancer.
The first three procedures are usually done in the doctor's office using a local anesthetic to numb the area. There may be some bleeding and other discharge and, for some women, discomfort similar to menstrual cramps. Conization is done under a general or local anesthetic and may be done in the doctor's office or the hospital.
If the biopsy indicates that cervical cancer is present, the doctor will refer the woman to a gynecologic oncologist, who specializes in treating this type of cancer. The specialist may suggest additional tests to see if the cancer has spread beyond the cervix.
The specialist may re-examine the pelvic area while the patient is under anesthetic to see if the cancer has spread to organs near the cervix, including the uterus, vagina, bladder, and rectum.Pelvic examination.
This procedure allows the doctor to view the inside of the bladder and urethra (canal that carries urine from the bladder) with a cystoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera). A cystoscopy is used to determine whether cancer has spread to the bladder.Cystoscopy.
This procedure allows the doctor to view the colon and rectum using a sigmoidoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera). A proctoscopy is used to see if the cancer has spread to the rectum.Proctoscopy (also called a sigmoidoscopy).
This procedure allows the doctor to see the abdominal area with a laparoscope (a thin, lighted, flexible tube with a camera).Laparoscopy.
An x-ray is a picture of the inside of the body. For instance, a chest x-ray can help doctors determine if the cancer has spread to the lungs. An intravenous urography is a type of x-ray that is used to view the kidneys and bladder.X-ray.
A CT scan creates a three-dimensional picture of the inside of the body with an x-ray machine. A computer then combines these images into a detailed, cross-sectional view that shows any abnormalities or tumors. Sometimes, a contrast medium (a special dye) is injected into a patients vein to provide better detail.Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan.
An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. A contrast medium may be injected into a patients vein to create a clearer picture.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
A PET scan is a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a patients body and absorbed by the organs or tissues being studied. This substance gives off energy that is detected by a scanner, which produces the images.Positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Staging
Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis (chance of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer. One tool that doctors use to describe the stage is the TNM system. This system uses three criteria to judge the stage of the cancer: the tumor itself, the lymph nodes around the tumor, and if the tumor has spread to the rest of the body. The results are combined to determine the stage of cancer for each person. There are five stages: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (one through four). The stage provides a common way of describing the cancer, so doctors can work together to plan the best treatments. TNM is an abbreviation for tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M). Doctors look at these three factors to determine the stage of cancer:
How large is the primary tumor and where is it located?(Tumor, T)
Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes?(Node, N)
Has the cancer metastasized to other parts of the body?(Metastasis, M)
Using the TNM system, the "T" plus a letter or number (0 to 4) is used to describe the size and location of the tumor. Some stages are divided into smaller groups that help describe the tumor in even more detail. (Roman numerals given are stages used in another widely used staging system from the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d' Obstetrique, or FIGO). The primary tumor cannot be evaluated due to lack of information. More tests may be needed. This stage is called carcinoma (cancer) in situ, which means that the cancer is found only in the layer of cells lining the cervix and has not spread deeper into the cervix. The carcinoma is found only in the cervix. Invasive carcinoma was diagnosed only by microscopy (viewing cervical tissue/cells under a microscope). Any tumor found macroscopically (large enough to be recognized by imaging tests or to be seen/felt by the doctor) is referred to as stage T1b or FIGO IB. There is a cancerous area of 3.0 millimeters (mm) or smaller in depth, and 7.0 mm or smaller in terms of how far it has spread horizontally. There is a cancerous area larger than 3.0 mm but not larger than 5.0 mm, and a horizontal spread of 7.0 mm or smaller. In this stage, there is a lesion visible to the doctor, and the cancer is just found in the cervix, there is a microscopic lesion (one able to be seen using a microscope) that is greater in size than a stage T1a2/FIGO IA2 tumor. The cancer may have been found because of a physical examination, laparoscopy, or other imaging methods. The tumor is 4.0 centimeters (cm) or smaller. The tumor is larger than 4.0 cm. The cervical carcinoma has grown beyond the uterus but not to the pelvic wall or to the lower third of the vagina. The tumor has not spread to the tissue next to the cervix, also called the parametrial area. The tumor has spread to the parametrial area. The tumor extends to the pelvic wall, and/or involves the lower third of the vagina, and/or causes hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney), nonfunctioning kidney, or blockage of the ureters (tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder). The tumor involves the lower third of the vagina, but it has not grown into the pelvic wall. The tumor has grown into the pelvic wall and/or causes hydronephrosis or nonfunctioning kidneys. The tumor has spread to the mucosa (lining) of the bladder or rectum and grown beyond the true pelvis. The N in the TNM staging system stands for lymph nodes, the tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. Lymph nodes near the site of the cancer are called regional lymph nodes. Lymph nodes in other parts of the body are called distant lymph nodes. The regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated. There is no regional lymph node metastasis. The tumor has invaded the regional lymph node(s). The "M" in the TNM system indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Distant metastasis cannot be evaluated. There is no distant metastasis. There is distant metastasis. Doctors assign the stage of the cancer by combining the T, N, and M classifications. The tumor is called carcinoma in situ. In other words, the cancer is found only in the first layer of cells lining the cervix, not in the deeper tissues (Tis, N0, M0). Carcinoma in situ is not considered to be an invasive cancer The cancer has spread from the cervix lining into the deeper tissue but is still just found in the uterus. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body (T1, N0, M0). This stage may be described in more detail. T1a, N0, M0 T1a1, N0, M0 T1a2, N0, M0 T1b, N0, M0 T1b1, N0, M0 T1b2, N0, M0 The cancer has spread beyond the cervix to nearby areas, such as the vagina or tissue near the cervix, but it is still inside the pelvic area. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body (T2, N0, M0). This stage may be described in more detail. T2a, N0, M0 T2b, N0, M0 The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and vagina but not to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body (T3, N0, M0). The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina but not to other parts of the body (T3a, N0, M0). The cancer may have spread as far as the pelvic wall and to lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body (T1, T2, or T3a; N1, M0). If it has spread to the pelvic wall, it is called stage IIIb regardless of whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes (T3b, any N, M0). The cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum and may or may not have spread to the lymph nodes, but it has not spread to other parts of the body (T4, any N, M0). The cancer has spread to other parts of the body (any T, any N, M1). . Recurrent cancer is cancer that comes back after treatment. It may come back in the cervix or in another place.
