Infection with sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV)is a cause of virtually all cervical cancers. Molecular evidencealso provides support for a role for HPV, particularly HPV-16,in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of squamous-cell carcinomasof the head and neck. Genomic DNA of oncogenic HPV is detectedin approximately 26% of all squamous-cell carcinomas of thehead and neck worldwide, but the molecular evidence is mostrigorous and consistent for oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma,in which viral integration and the expression of viral oncogenes(E6 and E7) have been shown.    Oropharyngeal cancer was also strongly associated with serologicmeasures of exposure to HPV-16 and with the presence of oralHPV infection (). Oropharyngeal cancer was significantlyassociated with seropositivity for the HPV-16 L1 capsid protein,a validated measure of lifetime HPV-16 exposure (odds ratio,32.2; 95% CI, 14.6 to 71.3). The presence of an oral HPV-16infection was strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancer(odds ratio, 14.6; 95% CI, 6.3 to 36.6), as was oral infectionwith any of 37 HPV types (odds ratio, 12.3; 95% CI, 5.4 to 26.4)().  To explore whether the association between sexual behaviorsand oropharyngeal cancer could be explained by HPV-16 exposure,we reevaluated the associations using multivariate models afteradjusting for HPV-16 L1 serologic status. In this analysis,sexual behaviors were no longer significantly associated withoropharyngeal cancer (data not shown). However, associationsof sexual behaviors with oropharyngeal cancer became strongerwhen the analysis was restricted to patients with an HPV-16–positivetumor (). A high lifetime number of oral-sex or vaginal-sexpartners, engagement in casual sex, early age at first intercourse,and infrequent use of condoms each were associated with HPV-16–positiveoropharyngeal cancer ().  We evaluated whether combined exposure to HPV and tobacco oralcohol further increased the odds that oropharyngeal cancerwould develop. No evidence of synergy was found (, top):combined exposure to HPV and heavy tobacco and alcohol use wasnot additive (synergy index <1). Moreover, when the analysiswas restricted to patients who were seropositive for the HPV-16L1 protein, the odds of oropharyngeal cancer were not increasedamong heavy users of tobacco or alcohol (, bottom). Bycontrast, among patients who were seronegative for the HPV-16L1 protein, the odds of oropharyngeal cancer were increasedamong heavy users of tobacco or alcohol, and the odds of oropharyngealcancer were further increased among heavy users of both tobaccoand alcohol (synergy index >1) (, bottom). Similarrelationships were observed in patients with and those withoutthe presence of an oral HPV-16 infection (). Therefore,tobacco and alcohol were important risk factors for oropharyngealcancer, but they may not have acted as cofactors in HPV-mediatedcarcinogenesis in the oropharynx.  To corroborate the in situ data, we tested for serum antibodiesagainst HPV-16 oncoprotein E6, E7, or both, which have highspecificity but moderate sensitivity for the detection of invasivecancer associated with HPV-16. Such antibodies were foundin 64% of the case patients and in 4% of the control patients(odds ratio, 58.4; 95% CI, 24.2 to 138.3; P<0.001) ().
