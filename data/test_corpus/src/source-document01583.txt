(p. 479) The first mayor of Tulsa, and the father of the town government which was organized in 1898, was (p. 480) Col. . He is a pioneer lawyer of Indian Territory, having located at South McAlester in 1889, about the time the United States Court was established there. He moved to Tulsa in 1894, and practiced law until 1906, and now gives his time to his property interests in the city. It is a remarkable instance of the rapid growth of Oklahoma cities that Tulsa first organized a municipal government in 1898, and that just ten years later it had grown to be a city of such business interests that its commercial club could afford to send out a special delegation to the principal cities of the United States to advertise the advantages and resources of this former trading point for three Indian nations.     Colonel is a veteran soldier as well as a veteran lawyer. He has had a varied career since he was admitted to the bar at Greenville, Ohio, in 1860. He had come to Greenville with his parents in 1852, from his birthplace at Burlington, Bradford county, Pennsylvania, where he was born August 20, 1836. He was a student at Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, and read law three years in Greenville. While trying his first cases at Greenville the war broke out and he enlisted, on the first call for volunteers for the three months' service. While with the Eighty-seventh Ohio Infantry he was captured at Harper's Ferry, and being exchanged, re-entered the service at Indianapolis in the Seventh Indiana Cavalry. He became lieutenant under , was for two years on staff duty with the noted cavalryman, General , and with headquarters at Memphis, participated in all the cavalry raids through Tennessee and Mississippi, in conflict with General . The most effective part of this service was in the scouting and cavalry movements leading up to the siege of Vicksburg. At the battle of Guntown, Mississippi, in March, 1865, Mr. was wounded, and was disabled for further service in the conflict then drawing to a close. For over twenty years he practiced law at Rochester, Indiana, being one of the leading members of the local bar and also influential in Indiana politics. He was a Republican member of the Indiana legislature in 1870-71, during the notable session when was elected to his second term in the United States senate. From Indian Mr. moved to Indian Territory. Since moving to Tulsa he has judiciously invested in business property, most of it along Main street, which the city's development has made many times more valuable that at the time he secured it. Colonel was one of the organizers of the Tulsa Bar Association, and was its first president, an office he held for four years. Outside of his profession one of his chief interests has been in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was present at the first reunion of the armies of the Cumberland and Tennessee in Chicago in 1868, at which all three great commanders of the war were present. It is an interesting incident of his career that at that session he introduced a resolution expressing sympathy with the Cubans in their struggles with Spanish rule, and it was a continuation of this same contention that brought about American intervention in the war of 1898. Colonel organized the G. A. R. in Indian Territory, and was the first department commander of the Territory. He is a Republican in politics. , before her marriage, was Miss . She was born in Lima, Ohio, and reared in Peru, Indiana. They were married at Watseka, Illinois. Her death occurred September 29, 1908. COL. EDWARD CALKINS. Edward Calkins

    The history of Tulsa's development is truly marvelous, and yet it has been but the logical result of the well-directed and concerted efforts of its citizens of enterprise, foresight and determination. To this class belongs , a prominent business man who was formerly mayor of the city and came originally to this section of the country as a minister and missionary. He was born at Melton-Mowbray, Leicestershire, England, in 1847, his parents being and . Melton-Mowbray has been the ancestral home of the family for many generations, extending back to the year 1066, when the original Mowbray in England, COL. GEORGE W. MOWBRAY. George W. MowbrayJohnCatherine (Lockton) Mowbray

having crossed the channel with William the Conqueror, there established his castle. His more remote ancestors were Norsemen, who settled in Normandy. This ancestral home in Leicestershire became the seat of the earldom of Mowbray, occupied by the successive lords of the Mowbray name until the time of , who destroyed the castle because of the fact that the Mowbrays were royalists. The family also built the old parish church at Melton-Mowbray and the remains of the ancestors now rest in its mausoleum.     was educated principally at the Grantham grammar school, from which he was graduated. This is the Lincolnshire school which enjoys the distinction of having had Sir for a pupil. Although Mr. Mowbray's parents were communicants of the established Church of England, he decided to enter the non-conformist ministry and accordingly was licensed to preach by the Wesleyan Methodist church. He came to America at the age of twenty-two years, and preached his first sermon on American soil in the Methodist church at Binghamton, New York, in November, 1869. There he remained in an active pastorate for six years, while subsequently he was located at Owego, New York, and afterward at Elmira, where he remained as minister of the Methodist church for nine years. He was afterward transferred to a church of that denomination at Tioga county, Pennsylvania, where he continued for about a year and a half, and later went to McCune, Crawford county, in southeastern Kansas. In 1887 he left the Sunflower state for Tulsa, coming here as a missionary minister for the Southern Kansas conference, and when the Indian mission conference was organized he became one of its members. This was formed by Bishop , March 21, 1889. Mr. was one of the first missionaries to this part of the Creek Nation, and remained in ministerial work until 1896, when he retired from active pulpit relations with the church and entered business life.     Mr. carried on a large mercantile store, which had been established originally by his son-in-law, , who had come to Tulsa with a commissary store at the time of the completion of the Frisco Railroad to this point in 1882. Mr. died in 1894 and Mr. afterward carried on the business for several years, with a full line of furniture, hardware, implements, vehicles, etc. Finally, however, he disposed of the larger part of his mercantile interests, retaining only the undertaking department, which he still conducts. It has not been alone in mercantile lines, however, that he has left the impress of his individuality upon the city's development and substantial progress. In fact, as a public official, he has done much for its welfare. He served as mayor of Tulsa in 1903-04, being one of the most progressive and efficient officials the city has ever had. He took a leading part in advancing its public-spirited movements throughout the period of his residence here and has been an important factor in that growth and development which has made Tulsa one of the remarkable and attractive cities of the southwest. Prior to his service as mayor he had been the treasurer and the first president of the Tulsa Commercial Club, to the interests of which he devoted much time and money, making many trips to western cities for the exploitation of the resources of Tulsa and the surrounding country. He was largely instrumental in influencing the Santa Fe Railroad to extend its line to this point, and, in fact, was the first man to bring Tulsa to the attention of the outside world. For three years he served as president of the school board, and formerly was vice president of the City National Bank.     Mr. was married in England to Miss , and they have four living children: Mrs. , , Mrs. and Mrs. . Mr. is well known as a representative of fraternal circles, being prominent in the Odd Fellows and Masonic lodges. He has attained the thirty-second degree of the Scottish Rite and is also Knights Templar and a member of the Mystic Shrine. He has taken all of the degreesOliver Cromwell

He was president of the board of directors of the beautiful Odd Fellow's Home at Checotah, superintended its construction, acting as its first superintendent after its completion. Mr. is a man of most alert and enterprising spirit, whose interest in his city and its welfare is manifest in many tangible ways, while his business ability and enterprise are widely recognized.Mowbray
  The Democratic representative from the Tulsa county district in the first state legislature, when it convened in December, 1907, was who has been a consistent and enthusiastic advocate of statehood and the highest interests of Oklahoma and Indian Territory for a number of years. Mr. is a resident of Tulsa, where, until recently, he was connected with the mercantile business, but during the past ten years has resided and had business interests in various parts of the two territories. He was a member of the statehood delegation that visited Washington in 1905, and which was chiefly instrumental in bringing about the legislation that resulted in the enabling act, the constitutional convention, and finally statehood.     Mr. was born near Circleville, Fairfield county, Ohio, April 29, 1866, and was taken, at the age of two years, by his parents to Morris county, Kansas, where they located on a farm as pioneers of the country. Reared on a farm, Mr. had the advantages of the local schools, supplemented by higher schooling in the Kansas State Normal at Emporia. He was for eight years a school teacher, and at one time superintendent of the schools at Dunlap, Kansas. He came to Oklahoma Territory in 1897, and has since been actively engaged in business. He was in the grain and feed business at Ponca, then moved to Duncan, Indian Territory, near the line of the Kiowa-Comanche reservation, and with the opening of the latter country on August 6, 1901, established a branch of his Duncan business at Lawton. Later he was in the real estate business at Hastings, in Comanche county, and in 1903 established his mercantile house at Tulsa, where he has since lived. On East Third street, between Boston and Cincinnati avenues, the substantial two-story business block which he erected was the first business improvement in that part of the city, but has since become central in a business district. Since selling out his business in 1907 Mr. has given his attention to his general business interests in the new state and to public affairs. Mr. was on the following committees while in the legislature: Manufactures and Commerce, Oil and Gas, Geological and Economic Survey, Municipal Corporations, Revenues and Taxation. He was elected by the largest proportional majority of any member of the house, getting 2,246 of the 2,372 votes cast in his district. He was the author of the bill to issue county bonds, etc. Fraternally he is a Mason and an Odd Fellow and an Elk. His wife, before her marriage, was Miss , a native of Indiana. They have a son, went to Kansas with her parents when she was six years old. Her father took up land in Lyon county, Kansas. is a member of the Presbyterian church, as also is her son. CICERO L.

  The sixty-eighth constitutional district, comprising Tulsa and vicinity, elected as delegate to the constitutional convention , a prominent lawyer of that city and one of the leaders in professional and public affairs from the time when Tulsa was a village. Mr. was chosen to the convention over a very strong Republican opposition, and was active in the deliberations which produced the first constitution. He was a member of various committees, the one which occupied most of his time and attention being the committee on county boundaries. As one of the representative citizens of the new state, he was further honored by appointment, in December, 1907, from Governor , as one of the regents of the Oklahoma State University.

    Mr. , who has been a resident of Tulsa since 1895, was born in Copiah county, Mississippi, in 1870, a son of and , both of whom are still living in Hazelhurst, Copiah county. In 1861 his father, then only fourteen years old, enlisted in the Twelfth Mississippi Regiment, and served throughout the war, mostly in Virginia, participating in the historic battles at Seven Pines, Manassas, Fredericksburg, and others. Virginia was the ancestral home of the , grandfather of the Oklahoma lawyer, being born and reared in Culpeper county. Bringing his family to Mississippi some time before the war, he bought the old homestead of ex-Governor in Copiah county, known as Holly Grove, a fine old estate surrounded by one of the largest plantations in the state. The residence which he erected there, of the finest material and construction, still remains one of the noted attractions of Copiah county. mother is descended from a North Carolina family, her father coming from there to Copiah county and, like , becoming one of the large planters of the county.     The old homestead was the home of during his youth. He received the best educational advantages. After attending the local schools and leaving high school in 1885, he entered the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College at Starkville, winning a medal in oratory. Three years later, having determined to study law, he came home and entered the office of Judge , one of the prominent lawyers of Hazelhurst, remaining there until 1889, when he became a student of the University of Mississippi at Oxford. He was elected by the student body as salutatorian at commencement of '89. Following a two-years' course of English and belles-lettres, he finished the two-year law course in one year, graduating in 1892. Another member of his class was , now the distinguished Oklahoma lawyer at Oklahoma City. Mr. located at Birmingham, Alabama in September, 1892. Taking naturally to politics and public life, he stumped the city for Cleveland and the Democratic ticket, under the auspices of the Democratic state executive committee. After practicing awhile in Birmingham, he moved to Muskogee, Indian Territory, in September, 1893, taking a partnership in the law office of his cousin, .     In 1895, when Mr. permanently identified himself with Tulsa, that center, now so populous and industrially and commercially prosperous, was an inconspicuous village in a thinly settled Indian country. From this condition Mr. has substantial real estate and financial interests in this city and surrounding country, and as one of the prominent lawyers has become a dominating influence in the public affairs of the eastern half of the new state.

  The industrial opportunities of Oklahoma and Indian Territory during the last eight or ten years have attracted some forceful men to engage in the work of development. Men of unusual daring, eager to undertake large affairs with little regard for difficulties, gifted with remarkable business acumen and skill, such talents and abilities may be found in those at the head of the largest business enterprises of Oklahoma as would do credit to any state. The oil region about Tulsa has brought there some men of this character. One of the best known is , whose own career is interesting, and whose father possesses the business genius and the striking attributes of the modern man of affairs that are the chief characteristics of the modern age of business.     Captain was born at Huntsville, Missouri, a son of , a Kentuckian, who helped found the town of Huntsville.

( is now a wealthy retired citizen of El Paso, Texas, of which city he was mayor a few years ago.) is a born speculator. He has made and lost several large fortunes, always with a steady courage that enables him to continue fighting whether he wins or loses. He raised the capital and built the Galveston, LaPorte & Houston Railroad, from Houston to La Porte, Texas, now a division of the Southern Pacific system. He also built a railroad in Mississippi. He assisted in the organization of the Mississippi Valley Trust Company, of St. Louis, and, with other capitalists of that city, engaged extensively in lead and zinc mining in Missouri, and later in gold mining in Colorado and Nevada. One of his latest fields of exploitation is Idaho, where, n 1907, he began work on a large irrigation project. was one of those who made a fortune in the Indian Territory oil fields. In 1904, the pioneer oil well at Alluwe, in the Cherokee Nation, was the strike that at once gave him prominence as an oil developer. In May, 1906, making his first appearance at Glenn Pool, he invested a moderate sum in leases, and within fifteen months had cleared half a million dollars in profits.     One of the stories told of financial experiences illustrates his unshaken nerve under the worst circumstances. He is a game loser, as an ardent winner. During the early nineties he went to New York to close the sale of a railroad he had built in Mississippi to . Three million dollars was at stake in the deal. The papers had been drawn, and he and were closing their interview in the latter's private office. Just as Mr. picked up the pen to sign his name to the document that would conclude the negotiation, a messenger came in with a cablegram announcing the failure of the Baring Bros., of London. His signature was never affixed, the transaction came to an abrupt conclusion, and though it meant millions of dollars to , he took it all with philosophic humor, and at once returned to St. Louis to begin work on other enterprises. wife, now deceased, was , a native of Fayette county, Missouri.  , of Tulsa, is a son of this capitalist, and inherits his qualities. He was born at Huntsville, Missouri, April 15, 1878. His educational advantages were of the best, beginning with the public schools of Mexico, Missouri and continued throughout the Mexico Military Academy, the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, where he was graduated with the class of 1900, in the Kansas City Law School, from which he was graduated in 1901, and a post-graduate law course at Yale Law School. He began practicing law at Kansas City in 1902. While in school he took a great interest in journalism, and his talents in that line and his practical training have afforded him a gratifying occupation aside from the promotion of financial and industrial enterprises. He has the newspaper man's special liking for the work, and his taste has run particularly in the line of dramatic criticism. As a student of drama and a writer on its forms and representation, he has found, not a means of livelihood, but a means of recreation and diversion from the more trying labors of his business career. Just before locating at Tulsa he was temporarily engaged in the newspaper business at Pawhuska, where he established the first daily paper, the . Mr. was formerly a member of the bar at Oklahoma City, where he opened an office in 1904, but came to Tulsa the following year. The oil boom was at its height, and becoming associated with his father in the promotion of some enterprises in this line, he abandoned the legal profession as offering an inadequate field for his energies, and has since made a distinguished success in this industrial field. Several leases in the Glenn Pool came into the ownership of Mr. Hammett, who developed them, and after operating them at a large profit, sold them at large figures of increase over their cost.B. F.

His father, a native of England, came to America in 1858 and resided for a short period in Illinois, after which he removed to the Indian Territory, and following the outbreak of the Civil war he joined the Confederate army and served throughout the period of hostilities. When the war was ended he established a permanent home in the Cherokee Nation, where the town of Claremore was later established and developed. At that time, however, the village had not yet been founded, and the country was but sparsely settled, particularly by white men. He married Miss , a member of one of the most prominent and aristocratic Cherokee families. She was born at Tahlequah, the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and still lives at the old home in Claremore. The death of , however, occurred in 1884. He was a farmer and stockman of large and substantial interests in the Cherokee Nation.     Reared under the parental roof, was afforded excellent educational facilities and after attending the male academy at Tahlequah, continued his studies in St. Francis School, at Osage, Kansas, and in a business college at Fort Worth, Texas. He was likewise a student in Willie Haskell College at Vinita, and when his education was completed he turned his attention to the live stock business at Claremore, being a prominent representative of that important business interest until 1905.     In that year Mr. removed to his present home in Tulsa, established a real estate agency, and has since engaged in the purchase and sale of property, negotiating many important realty transfers, and through his business activities and personal interests is contributing largely to the upbuilding of this remarkable young city, the growth of which has been so rapid as to partake of the nature of the marvelous. He possesses marked energy, keen sagacity and unfaltering perseverancequalities which are always essentials in the successful business career.     Mr. is also a factor in political circles and at the general statehood election on September 17, 1907, was elected, as Democratic candidate, to the new office of registrar of deeds of the new county of Tulsa. On the 16th of November he entered upon the duties of the position, for which his education, training and previous experience ably qualified him. He had previously had legislative experience, for at Claremore, in 1901, he was elected a member of the Cherokee Nation council, and was the youngest member of that body.

  Inseparably interwoven with the history of Tulsa and its development is the name of , now a wealthy merchant and mine owner who has a wide and favorable acquaintance here. His marked enterprise and diligence have not only been factors in his personal success, but have also contributed to general progress. He is yet a young man, his birth having occurred in Forest City, Missouri, in 1870. He resided there until twelve years of age, when he went to Nevada, Missouri, where he made his home until his removal to Tulsa in 1890. The embryo city at that time had a population of not more than fifty and few would have believed that it would prove a city for a successful business career, but foresaw the possibilities here and time has proved the wisdom of his judgment. He has been connected with commercial affairs throughout his entire life, starting when a small boy in a humble clerkship and embarking in business on his own account when but seventeen years of age.     On removing to Tulsa, opened a small store at what is now the southeast corner of the Brady Hotel block, occupying there a little frame building sixteen by thirty-two feet. Day by day the business grew in volume and also advanced in the confidence and respect of the buying public. He has based his success upon certain principles and rules, from which he has never deviated. He has also made it his purpose to carry the best quality of goods and to sell at a reasonable figure and to represent his stock in just and honorable manner. He has also believed in liberal advertising, and his careful control of his business and his keen discernment have enabled him to develop an enterprise which has now reached an extensive figure, its sales being represented by the sum of one hundred thousand dollars annually. Today the house owns its own building and the floor space is forty-four by one hundred and sixty feet. The stock is valued at forty thousand dollars, the shoe stock alone amounting to ten thousand dollars. After carrying on business alone for a time organized the present Brady Mercantile Company and is today at the head of one of the largest commercial establishments in the eastern half of the state.     A many [man] of ready resource, wide outlook and keen discernment, he has not concentrated his energies upon one line, but has extended his efforts into other fields and owns and operates the Brady coal mines, about five miles east of Tulsa, representing an extensive industry. He is indeed not only a pioneer merchant, but also a pioneer in the operation of the coal fields, thus developing the rich mineral resources of this part of the state. He opened his first mine W.TATE BRADY. W. Tate BradyMr. Brady

in 1893 and has since been busily engaged in placing its products on the market. He also erected the Brady Hotel, of which he is still the owner, and which, in 1907, was greatly enlarged by a new addition, making it one of the extensive hotels of the new state. He is likewise financially interested in banks and other business concerns, which show him to be a man of resourceful ability and enterprise, and which are proving an element in the rapid and substantial growth of this section of the state, as well as a source of individual profit.     In 1895, Mr. was united in marriage to Miss , of Kensington, Georgia, and they have four children: and . The family home is one of the finest of Tulsa's many fine residences, and, standing on Brady Heights, commands a splendid view of the surrounding country. In his political affiliation is a Democrat, recognized as one of the leaders of the party in the state, and now serving as a member of the Democratic state executive committee. He has always refused political preferment for himself, accepting only honorary positions, but has done effective work in municipal affairs as president of the Tulsa school board and is a member of the city council. He is prominent among the energetic, far-seeing and successful men of Tulsa and is equally well known for his public spirit.

a leading architect whose ability has gained him prestige in his chosen profession, is located at Tulsa and is an influential and governing factor in building operations, which are making this a beautiful modern city. He was born at Zanesville, Muskingum county, Ohio, in 1846. In 1866 his parents, and , went with their family to Missouri, settling in Pettis county, where the mother still resides, the father, however, having passed away in 1905.   is numbered among the veterans of the Civil war. He was, however, one of the youngest soldiers of the Union army, enlisting when only fifteen years of age at Newark, Licking county, Ohio, on the 27th of November, 1861, as a member of Company D, Seventy-sixth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, under Captain and Colonel . Going with his command to the front, he was a participant in many important battles, including the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, the siege of Corninth, the battles of Pea Ridge, Milliken's Bend, Haines' Bluff, Greenville, Bolivia, Chickasaw Bayou, Arkansas Post, Deer Creek, Fourteen Mile Creek and Jackson, the sieges of Vicksburg and Jackson, the battles of Canton, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge and Ringgold, the siege and battle of Atlanta, Sherman's march to the sea and the advance northward through South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia to Washington, where he participated in the grand review at the close of the war, it being the most celebrated military pageant ever seen on the western hemisphere. On that occasion thousands of Union soldiers marched through the streets of the city and passed the reviewing stand, on which were seated the President and other notable men of the nation, while over broad Pennsylvania avenue swung a banner, bearing the words, "the only debt which our country cannot pay is the debt which she owes her soldiers." When the war was over, Mr. , still but a boy in years, but a man in his war experiences, returned home. The following year he accompanied his parents on their removal to Pettis county, Missouri, and resumed his education, which had been interrupted by the exigencies of the war. He received excellent school privileges in Sedalia and St. Louis, the greater part of his technical education in the preparation of the profession of an architect being received in the latter city. He had practical experience, however, from his early boyhood under his father, who was a contractor and builder in Ohio and later in Sedalia, Missouri. His first independent experience in architectural lines was a Warrensburg, Johnson county, Missouri, whence he removed to Monett, that state, where he followed the profession of an architect for several years. In 1903 he arrived at Tulsa, where he has since made his home. LEE MATHEWS, S. H.Margaret (Sperry) Mathews

    As an architect and superintendent of construction Mr. has taken a very important part in the remarkable upbuilding and substantial improvement of Tulsa, which began about the time of his arrival here and has continued uninterruptedly to the present time. He has erected more buildings here than any other one man, a large number of them being the most prominent buildings of the city, including Robinson Hotel, Rosefield building, World building, Trimble block, Mowbray & Half building, Elks' building, Hamilton building, the Alexander & Shelton block, the Kellman block, the residence, the residences of and a large number of other well-known buildings of the city. His contracts have not only included business structures and residence but also public buildings, schoolhouses and churches. The attractiveness of Tulsa from an architectural standpoint is largely due to his efforts and, as will be seen, many of the most important structures here stand as monuments to his thrift, enterprise and ability. He is also the editor and publisher of the well-known architectural journal called Home Building, which is issued at Tulsa, and has been an influential factor in inducing citizens to build more attractive and convenient homes, thus adding to the beauty of the city and surroundings.     Mr. was united in marriage to Miss , of Exeter, Missouri, and they have four children: Mrs. , of Enid; , and .
