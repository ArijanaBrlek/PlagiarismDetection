YOUR CHILD SUPPORT GETTING
Establishment and Enforcement of Child Support Orders
In Indiana, prosecutor's offices provide one-stop shopping for establishment and enforcement of child support. Prosecutors provide the following:
Establishment of paternity
Location of parents owing child support
Establishment of child support orders
Enforcement of child support orders
Receiving and Processing Child Support Payments
County Clerks' Offices are responsible receiving and processing child support payments. The clerk records and disburses child support payments.
Prosecutors can use the following child support enforcement tools to enforce a child support order:
Income Withholding
Child support can be withheld from a non-custodial parent's pay by court order.
Suspension of Driver's and Professional Licenses
If a court finds that a parent is at least $2,000 or 3 months past due on court-ordered child support as a result of an intentional violation of the support order, a court can order suspension of the parent's driver's license or professional license. A prosecutor or private attorney can ask for a court ordered license suspension.
Licensing agencies have an obligation under Indiana law to suspend licenses if ordered by the court. These agencies include:
    - Health Professions Bureau     - Horse Racing Commission     - Indiana Gaming Commission     - Department of Insurance     - Bureau of Motor Vehicles     - Department of Natural Resources     - Professional Standards Boards (teachers)     - Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission (lawyers)
Intercepts
A prosecutor can obtain past due child support by interception a delinquent parent's tax refund, lottery winnings, unemployment and worker's compensation benefits, and unclaimed property.
Liens
A prosecutor or private attorney can establish and enforce a lien against the property of a parent who is delinquent in payment of child support.
Civil Contempt
A court can find a parent who is delinquent in payment of child support in contempt for violating a court order and impose sanctions including jail time and fines.
Criminal Charges for Nonsupport of a Dependent Child
A prosecutor has the discretion to file criminal charges when a person knowingly or intentionally fails to provide support for a dependent child. Criminal nonsupport of a dependent child is a Class D felony with a maximum sentence of 3 years. If more than $10,000 is owed to any individual child, a Class C felony criminal charge, with a maximum sentence of 8 years, can be filed. Prosecutors can extradite out-of-state criminal nonsupport defendants to Indiana for prosecution.
