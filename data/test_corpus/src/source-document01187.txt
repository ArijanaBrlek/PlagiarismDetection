Cumming, Skelton & Quinn’s brief gloss of the Block map reads in full:
This is the first map to show as a separate island the land of the “Manhates” Indians. Adriaen Block, a Dutch fur trader who arrived in 1611, began a coasting trip in the spring of 1614 on which he gathered information for his map. He sailed in his ship Onrust (the first boat built on Manhattan Island) “through Hellegat [East River] into the great bay [Long Island Sound] and explored all the places thereabout”. The territories of the “Mahicans”, “Pequats”, and other Indian tribes, soon to be well known to colonial settlers, are here shown; the “Meer Vand Irocoisen” (Lake Champlain) appears far east of the Connecticut River. Block Island was named after Adriaen Block.
