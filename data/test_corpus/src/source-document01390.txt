A Man On A Mission
I love MG cars. I own three and therein lies the problem. One is for parts, a 1968 MG Roadster, the second car is a 1968 MGBGT, it’s disassembled and sitting in the covered safety of my brothers garage in Idaho where the rust Gods can’t find it. The parts car is for it, and for a soon to be designed “boot” couch. The third car is a 1972 MG Midget that is the priority car to get restored.
I’ve owned one or more of the cars since 1987. The MGBGT was my daily driver until I found the rust and the bad repairs. I tore it apart only to find that life, my wife & kids, and a gazillion other priorities got in the way of restoration. The Midget has a similar story, not running when I found it, sound, minimal rust and none where it mattered. I had it together, bad paint and all and then I thought, hey, it’s a small car, how much trouble can it be to restore it first.
That was 10 years ago and I’m now ready to tackle the project.
This blog is meant to be a history of the restoration, in word, pictures, and maybe some video. I’m not the most serious person in the world so I’m going to inject my own brand of humor into this restoration tale. I hope you will enjoy this project, encourage me in it, and if you’re Bill Gates, will drop me some serious dough so that I can get the bodywork done. I can handle everything else. Hey Bill, I’ll give you a chance to ride in it if you fund the project. You can’t drive it though, I’ve heard you don’t do that well.
