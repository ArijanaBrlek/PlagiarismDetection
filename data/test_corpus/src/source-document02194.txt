The transcription factor 7-like 2 () has been recentlyassociated with diabetes risk, and it may exert its effect throughmetabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits and be subjected tomodification by environmental factors. We investigated the effectof single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs7903146 and rs12255372,within the locus on postprandial lipemia and other MetS-relatedtraits and their modulation by dietary fat. Data were collectedfrom 1083 European Americans participating in the Genetics ofLipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study. Carriers of theminor T allele at the C/T rs7903146 SNP had higher fasting plasmaglucose ( = 0.012), lower homeostasis model assessment of cell function ( = 0.041), higher plasma VLDL ( = 0.035), andlower large LDL particle ( = 0.007) concentrations and higherrisk of MetS ( = 0.011) than CC individuals. Moreover, we identifiedsignificant interactions between this SNP and PUFA intake modulatingfasting VLDL particle concentrations ( = 0.016) and postprandialtriglycerides (TG) ( = 0.028), chylomicrons ( = 0.025), totalVLDL ( = 0.026), and large VLDL ( = 0.018) concentrations.Thus, only T allele carriers with a PUFA intake 7.36% of energyhad elevated fasting plasma VLDL concentrations and postprandialTG-rich lipoproteins. These variables did not differ in T allelecarriers and noncarriers in the low-PUFA intake group. Moreover,these significant interactions were due exclusively to (n-6)PUFA intake. In summary, high (n-6) PUFA intakes (6.62% of energyintake) were associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia in carriersof the minor T allele at the rs7903146 SNP and may predisposethem to MetS, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.TCF7L2TCF7L2PÎ²PPPPPPPPP
