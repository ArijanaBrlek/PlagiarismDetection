of Mill Lake, you could also stop by close by Saddle Lake. There's so much to do here at Mill Lake that you need to camp here for a while, Hardin Ridge - Hoosier National Forest is a magnificent location for that. This lake is so wonderful. Days Inn-Tell City is a wonderful site to get some rest. You'll need more than a day to discover everything Mill Lake has to offer, you can camp at Glennwood Hills Grounds. After a long day outdoors Ramada Limited is a good place to spend a night or two, and obviously Little Sulphur Creek flows through this area.
