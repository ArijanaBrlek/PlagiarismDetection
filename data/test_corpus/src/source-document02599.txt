Super Joints
Rated 10 out of 10
The "Super Joints" by Pavel Tsatsouline was excellent. After 30 years of practicing and teaching martial arts (Uechi/Shohei Ryu, and Ju Jitsu), and the natural "break down" of the joints with age, the "Super Joints" has helped to restore the flexibility and strength of my joints especially an arthritic shoulder. I have incorporated the "Super Joints" into my Russian kettlebell and functional training workouts.

Rated 10 out of 10
I enjoyed this video, as well as the other videos that Pavel presents. Although they seem short in length, Pavel shows you the essentials. Sometimes what is most important such as joint conditioning, is often the most basic in nature. Do the recommended exercises and get Pavelized!!! Thats an Order!!! And watch Rambo III. Its required viewing!!!

Pavel is the Funniest Guy!
Rated 8 out of 10
Not only were these exercises great for me (a non body builder/non special forces person), but Pavel gave me quite a few laughs. I have a dry sense of humor, and some of my friends thought he was down-right cheezy, but I found it enjoyable. As for the purpose of the DVD, it seems to be working well for my creaky joints, but they are not completely fixed after two weeks. I have every confidence they will be fixed soon!

Joints of a teen again...
Rated 10 out of 10
At 37 years of age, my joints had already been cracking and hurting in the morning. I sustained an injury parachuting in the Air Force in 1989 and since, have had many back pains. I ordered Super Joints figuring it would be good, as all of Pavel's dvd's and books have been excellent. The first day I went through the dvd and did all the joint mobility drills. I felt better that day and over the course of the following week noticed that in the morning, my back wasn't as stiff and my elbows didn't hurt. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone that cares about their joints.

Easy and awesome
Rated 10 out of 10
Easy-to-do exercises that really do loosen things up. I'm 52, so it takes some time to kick in, but it works!!! I've been recommending it highly to everyone I know.

Perfect for martial artists
Rated 10 out of 10
I now stretch 3 times a week and I follow this dvd. It's perfect for martial artists who are over 30 like myself. I started Capoeira at age 31 and with all the movements we do, I needed a good stretching dvd that was modified for older joints and this is the one.

Great for old, creaking joints--or young ones
Rated 10 out of 10
As a 54 year old who just refuses to give up on martial arts, lifting and the entire lifestyle, this was really a great addition to my "keep the parts moving" arsenal. Some of these movements I recognized from Yoga, but many were at least a new twist (no pun intended) on things that have added quite a bit to my stretching and joint maitenence efforts. I very strongly recommend it.

Superjoints DVD is perfect for the visual learner
Rated 10 out of 10
I've been doing "Superjoints" for over a year now, and no other component of Pavel's training strategies has had a stronger impact on my progress! Although I prefer books over videos, my father, who needs to improve his joint mobility in the worst way, is more of a visual learner. Not only did the video get him started on the program, but I also picked up a few things that I had sort of missed in the book. The material is presented in Pavel's usual direct and straight-to-the-point style. No bells or whistles, just concise instructions and demonstrations. This video is an excellent resource!!

Comrade...Enjoy
Rated 8 out of 10
Super Joints is a DVD for all levels of ability and experience. This, I feel is one of its greatest strengths. The format is appropriate therefore, with two separate chapters. The less experienced athlete will benefit most from Chapter One while the more experienced athlete will be challenged by Chapter Two. I am personally fascinated by Pavel's unique, individual and quirkily humourous presentation but some might find him...strange. His demonstrations of the movements are outstanding and he performs even the most basic streach with amplitude. Customers who buy this DVD will, I think already be converted to the importance of streaching but what they might not be aware off are the intricacies of method and performance offered by Pavel. I look forward to continued use of this DVD as I progress through the stages of development shown.

DON'T BE A FOOL
Rated 10 out of 10
There are two reasons for not doing Super Joints #1 you don't know about it. #2 You are a dam FOOL. I'm 49 and have had knee trouble all my life. I have done those big squats in my 20's and 30's (500lb+). I gave up squating at 39 and for the last 9 years I suffered with aching knees and was afraid to squat. I have been doing Super Joints for the last 6 months (have not missed a day). No more pain no discomfort. This is my second copy. I love the way it makes all my joints feel. Thanks Pavel.

Pavel; Not so dis-jointed
Rated 9 out of 10
The only reason it didn't get a 10 is because I would like to know the why and how it works,just a little more in depth. The over all excersizes that should be done seemed to be very thorough.

Excellent video
Rated 10 out of 10
Super joints has been the perfect compliment to my kettlebell training. Residual tensions I developed over the last year of strength training have disappeared after my first day using SJ. The wind mill, and belly dancing alone were worth the price of the video. I also enjoyed the simple and precise explanations of the exercises. Pavel is truly a great fitness teacher.

Rated 10 out of 10
Pavel is ripped, flexible, funny, strong, and knows his stuff. I hurt my right shoulder, the AC joint, awhile back, and have been reluctant to lift weights and exercise, due to a slight pain. I got Super Joints hoping it would help--many customer reviews reported that it aided in rehabilitating their injuries. Even though it has only been a week of me doing the exercises, I am happy to say that is HAS helped. I'm not healed yet (it will take more than stretching; strengthing is next), but my joints all feel looser and more lubricated; even my ligaments and muscles feel looser and even STRONGER. Any which way, now I'm saving up to get Pavel's other stretching DVDs and Enter the Kettlebell! DVD, book, and kettlebell (I'm aiming to order it in the upcoming month). Along these lines, due to Pavel's non-endorsing endorsment, I've also begun the Warrior Diet/Anti-Estrogenic Diet, and it has helped clean me out from the inside as well (which I'm sure will help heal my shoulder and other ailments). No matter what, I'm now a Pavel enthusiast and look forward to building not only my Pavel library, but also my Pavel body!!!!

This DVD is the best of its kind.
Rated 10 out of 10
I have researched a lot of DVD's and the ones that keep your joints healty are few and far between. (I am a 65 year old librarian/exercise video enthusiast.) In fact, I have found only two others. I very much like the two other I found, but like Pavel's the best. It gets every joint and does it in a minimal amount of time. I am very happy I found it!

I saw your product while visiting my sister this summer. I enjoyed adding this flexibility to my regular workout with dumbells. The exercises really get rid of the creekie joints, especially in the shoulders and neck for me.

Good, solid information
Rated 7 out of 10
The Super Joints DVD provides some good, solid information about joint flexibility and strength. If you have spent any time stretching then you won't find much new in this DVD. Much of what Pavel demonstrates (especially in Chapter 1) is very similar to the stretches in QiGong Recharge. Chapter 2 coveres strength stretches. While Pavel goes over some very good stretches, I wish they had been presented in a coherent, sequential order. It seemed more like Pavel would demonstrate a stretch, and then would suddenly remember another stretch for another part of the body. There didn't seem to be a beginning, middle, and end. If there were a PDF document included as bonus material for this DVD that gave some suggested stretch routines I'd give the DVD a higher score.

Maybe a follow along format would be better. Also way too short, Pavel can put much more info and footage on his dvds for the price.

Unique and effective approach to flexibility
Rated 8 out of 10
Pavel is fascinating and sexy! I like to just watch him and then I start doing his flexibility exercises. I bought it for my husband but I love it. I feel great after his workout. It is fast, different, and effective. I run, olympic lift, and play tennis. This is helping to keep me injury free. I like it much better than yoga. Comrades, observe this video!

Back Pain Relief at last
Rated 8 out of 10
I really enjoyed the "Super Joints" DVD. I have suffered from chronic low back pain for years without relief. Putting the exercises into my daily rountine has dramatically reduced my back pain and provided some long overdue relief from near constant pain.

Disappearnce of 25 years of shoulder impingement pain!
Rated 9 out of 10
For 25 years, I have been unable to do any kind of chest press because of an impingement in my left shoulder, which always led to pain the day after doing any kind of pressing. 3 weeks of daily practicing of all the shoulder joint mobility drills in Super Joints (along with careful observation of 'healthy shoulder' pressing techniques learned on the DragonDoor fitness forum) ... and I was able to bench 5X5 55lb dumbbells last week totally pain free! Pain free after 25 years is truly great stuff. I'd love to achieve the same type of hip mobility improvements.

Not his best
Rated 5 out of 10
I own several outstanding Pavel products, but this one is not one of them. Although it is not without value for most people, for an athletic person it is redundant and too basic. For someone just starting a lifestyle change or trying to achieve flexibility, it would fill in knowledge gaps.

SUPER JOINTS, SUPER EFFECTIVE
Rated 10 out of 10
I bought this dvd after purchasing Pavel's Resilient dvd and have since combined exercises from both to turn back the clock on my body. I have been powerlifting for 15 years and Kettlebelling seriously for almost 2 years and have racked up enough injuries, aches and pains to last a lifetime. After using Super Joints for about 2 weeks, the pain that the dvd Resilient didn't take away, Super Joints did. Even though Pavel recommends doing a rep for every year you have lived to get full benefits, i have received tremendous results doing 10-20 reps (not quite the prescribed number but never the less still very effective). Even though i do use exercises from both dvds, Super Joints will solve most, if not all those "pains in the necks" (not human ones, unfortanely) you have experienced. I have recommended this to a friend of mine to send to his 70 year old father and results have been positive. How do i spell relief? SUPER-JOINTS!
