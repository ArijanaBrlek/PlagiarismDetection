King Trombones
The King tradition of excellence goes back to 1893, when Sunday concerts in the park were plentiful and the blare of trumpets & Trombones in minstrel bands sent shivers down the spine of anyone within hearing distance. Music was appreciated in America, but to some, it was more than just a walk in the park. As a young man, Henderson N. White loved music and theater. He ran an instrument repair shop in Cleveland, Ohio, and became friends with the musicians in the city. One of the finest musicians was Thomas King, a solo trombonist with the Lyceum Theatre Orchestra. He urged White to design a new trombone and offered to help. The two men collaborated, White providing his mechanical skill, King contributing his experience as an artist. They tried their ideas, tested them over a period of months, and finally produced a trombone with a vastly improved slide action and superb tonal quality. White named it the "King" trombone, after his friend. It was an immediate success in Cleveland and soon became one of the most popular trombones in the country.
