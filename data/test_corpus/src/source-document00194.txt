Lithium batteries ( for photovoltaic
In anticipation of a fivefold increase of the photovoltaic market in the next ten years, CEA researchers are currently developing batteries for integration in photovoltaic systems.
Install, connect and ready to go! Researchers are currently developing components that will enable the manufacture of photovoltaic systems ready to be installed via modules comprising a panel, a battery and associated electronic control circuitry. A CEA LITEN team is working specifically on the batteries. Design constraints are significant, since the components used must be lightweight and compact to allow easy handling and rapid installation, and their reliability and lifetime must be compatible with that of the photovoltaic panel.) The CEA team has opted for lithium batteries, which appear to meet these criteria more satisfactorily than conventional lead batteries. Various materials have been tested to optimise system performance in terms of lifetime, safety and cost. , explains Hélène Rouault, CEA researcher. A first series of twelve 10 Ah prototypes with a rated voltage of 3.2 V has been produced (15 batteries of this type are needed to power a 75 kW panel). The first cyclability tests under accelerated aging conditions indicate the possibility of faultless operation for 15 years without maintenance, despite temperature variations associated with daily sunshine exposure and seasonal changes (as opposed to lead batteries, whose lifetime - typically 3 years - is random, and which require periodic maintenance).) The housing design, the internal arrangement and the battery connections have been conceived to produce a flat battery. . Arranged uniformly on the entire rear surface of the solar panel (with the exception of the space occupied by the electronic strip), the batteries exhibit homogeneous operating characteristics and can withstand increases in temperature up to 60°C. A second prototype is currently under development to further reduce the overall system weight (to less than 7 kg) and improve performance under high temperature conditions by using new electrolytes.
“We are currently working on a graphite and phosphate-based lithium-ion battery system”“Phosphate is a high-capacity, thermally stable material with low electrolyte reactivity that can be used to propose a safe system with significant cyclability performance and lifetime”.
Zero maintenance (for 15 years
“We have managed to stay within an overall system thickness of 5 cm, which amounts to a battery thickness of only 1 cm, and a total weight of 30 kg, including 10 kg for the battery”
