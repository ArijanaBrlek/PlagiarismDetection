Visit a Rock 'n' Gem Show and be fascinated by a whole range of natural stone products from around the world. All available at reasonable prices, there are spectacular mineral specimens, sparkling crystals of every colour and ancient fossils. Created from the natural products there are beads, polished and carved stones and gold and silver jewellery inset with them. At several of our shows there is a Lapidary or Geology club either cutting and polishing gemstones or showing their geological collections. Our experienced exhibitors are always happy to discuss the products available, whether it is where and how they were mined or how they were formed. Young or old, experienced or novice - these are 'must see' events.
