A is the mouth of a where it flows into an , , or , building outwards (as a ) from carried by the river and deposited as the water current is dissipated. Deltaic deposits of larger, heavily-laden rivers are characterised by the river channel dividing into multiple streams (), these anastomizing (dividing and coming together again) to form a maze of active and inactive channels.delta river ocean sea lake deltaic deposit sediment distributaries
Formation
At the final course of a river, when it enters the sea, it mixes with the surrounding water, and its velocity of flow is checked, causing it to deposit its load of , , and . The first materials deposited are the gravel and sand, as they are by far the heaviest and coarsest. Next to be dropped is the silt. Because it is fine, the clay is transported in suspension quite far out in the sea. When salt water causes the clay to flocculate, it becomes heavier and sinks. As layers upon layers of alluvial materials are deposited, a platform of is built up and it eventually rises above the water, which can now be called the delta. The water then overflows the banks into different channels called distributaries, which build up their own . The vegetation that later grows on the alluvium stabilizes the delta. gravel sand silt clay alluvium levees
Where delta formation is river-dominated and less subject to or action, a delta may take on a multi-lobed shape which resembles a 's foot. The is an example of this type. tidal wave bird Mississippi delta
The most famous delta is that of the , and it is this delta from which the term is derived, because the Nile delta has a very characteristic shape, like the (upper-case) (Δ). Other rivers with notable deltas include the / combination (this delta spans most of ), the , the , the , the , the , the , the , and the .
