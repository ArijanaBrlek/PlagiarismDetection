Physical Rehabilitation and Therapy, St. John Macomb-Oakland Hospital, Oakland Center
It is sometimes difficult to make the transition from hospital to home after illness or injury. To ease the transition, theÂ our rehabilitation team works with patients to become as functional and independent as possible. We focus on maximizing abilities and maintaining dignity.
We offer a complete range of restorative and fitness services, which are individually designed to meet the needs of the total person. Therapists work with the patient and their family to design a specific treatment plan based upon present functional level and agreed upon goals. Our intent is for the patient to return to an appropriate functional level and independent activity.
