I joined the Rocky in January 1993, eager to help my friend and colleague Tracy Ringolsby  we had worked together in Kansas City  cover the Rockies. I knew it would be exciting to be around an expansion team and witness everything from the ground up. And I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to live in Colorado.
The Rocky turned out to be a better place than I could ever have imagined. Ive had the chance to work with talented editors and cover a topic I love and which matters a lot to many people. I consider myself fortunate to have been able to mesh my interests and abilities with my job and realize thats a privilege and by no means the workplace norm.
And now all that may be winding down with the Rocky facing a gloomy fate. At the Rockies first spring training in 1993, I remember interviewing catcher Brad Ausmus and having him use the word malevolent in one of his answers. I told him it was the first time a ballplayer had used that word. It remains the only time, something I reminded Dartmouth graduate Ausmus of in September when we were chatting informally at Coors Field.
Ausmus was then playing with the Houston Astros, and I reminded him of that verbal moment from long ago. He not only remembered but recalled the exact context, namely that there would be nothing malevolent on the Rockies part if they sent him to Triple-A Colorado Springs to open the 1993 season, which they did.
Ive thought lately of that give and take nearly 16 years ago with Ausmus. I know there are many people in this community who wont care and whose lives wont be affected in the least if the Rocky perishes. But if that does happen, something very tangible will be missing. And that will strike many people, not just employees at the Rocky, as nothing short of malevolent.
