Stay alert for high winds even if you do not "see" a tornado.Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up.
In fact, in the Great Plains and other semiarid regions, that scenario is the rule rather than the exception. Tornadoes are associated with a powerful updraft, so rain does not fall in or next to a tornado. Very large hail, however, does fall in the immediate area of the tornado. In humid environments, rain often tends to wrap around the tornado, being pulled from the main precipitation area around the outside of the rotating updraft. The rain could make it difficult to see the tornado.Tornadoes often occur when it is not raining.
In the western United States, waterspouts occur with cold late fall or late winter storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development. Waterspouts, which are tornadoes over a body of water, occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes and causing damage and injuries.Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water and are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states.
Keep windows closed. Houses do not explode due to air pressure differences. Stay away from windows during severe storms. Flying debris could shatter the glass and cause injury.Damage happens when wind gets inside a home through a broken window, door, or damaged roof.
Historical information has shown that any corner on the lowest level away from windows is as safe as any other corner. If tornado winds enter the room, debris has a tendency to collect in corners. When selecting a tornado "safe place," look for a place on the lowest level and away from windows, preferably in a small room (closet or bathroom) in the center of the house. Closer walls will help provide more support to the roof, and each wall between you and the outside will provide further protection.It used to be advised to go to the southwest corner for safety; however, the southwest corner of a house is no safer than any other corner.
Air pressure differences in a tornado are not strong enough to cause a house to explode; houses are damaged by the violent winds associated with a tornado and from the debris blown at high velocities by tornado winds.Folklore passed down through the generations used to advise opening windows in case of a tornado because air pressure differences would cause a house to explode. This information is not true.
because tornadoes do not necessarily travel in straight lines; you cannot always tell the direction the storm is coming from; the road you turn onto may curve and head into the storm, rather than away from it; and there may be more than one tornado associated with a strong storm system, but you may not see it because visibility is diminished by heavy rain and wind-blown debris. If a sturdy building is not available, then get out of the vehicle and lay down in a low spot on the ground not subject to flooding, protecting the head and neckFolklore also used to advise that if you are driving and a tornado is suspected or sighted, you should turn and drive at right angles to the storm. This advice is not recommendedThe safest thing to do is go to a nearby sturdy building and go inside to an area on the lowest level, without windows.
Plan for a Tornado
  Tornado-specific planning should include the following:Develop a Family Disaster Plan.
While severe tornadoes are more frequent in the Plains States, tornadoes have happened in every state. Contact your local emergency management office, local National Weather Service office, or American Red Cross chapter for more information on tornadoes.Learn about your tornado risk.
The safest place to be is underground, or as low to the ground as possible, and away from all windows. If you have a basement, make it your safe place. If you do not have a basement, consider an interior hallway or room on the lowest floor. Putting as many walls as you can between you and the outside will provide additional protection. Less than 2 percent of all tornadoes are powerful enough to completely destroy a sturdy building. Make sure there are no windows or glass doors in your safe place and keep this place uncluttered.Pick a safe place in your home where family members could gather during a tornado.
Additional reinforcement will add more protection from the damaging effects of tornado winds. Get more information from FEMA about building a tornado safe room.Consider having your tornado safe place reinforced.
You may not have enough time to go to the lowest floor. Center hallways are often structurally the most reinforced part of a building.If you are in a high-rise building, pick a place in a hallway in the center of the building.
A sturdy building provides greater protection. If your mobile home park has a designated shelter, make it your safe place. Mobile homes are much more vulnerable to strong winds than site-built structures. Prior to 1994, most manufactured homes were not designed to withstand even moderate winds. Mobile homes are not safe in a tornado so have a sturdy building picked out ahead that you will go to if a tornado warning is issued.If you live in a mobile home, choose a safe place in a nearby sturdy building.
Different communities have different ways of providing warnings. Many communities have sirens intended for outdoor warning purposes. Use a NOAA Weather Radio with a tone-alert feature to keep you aware of watches and warnings while you are indoors. Learn about your community's warning system. Make sure all family members know the name of the county or parish where you live or are traveling, because tornado watches and warnings are issued for a county or parish by name.Discuss how you would be warned of an approaching tornado.
Different communities have different ways of providing warnings. Many communities have sirens intended for outdoor warning purposes, many have no sirens at all. Use a NOAA Weather Radio with a tone-alert feature to keep you aware of watches and warnings while you are indoors.Learn about your community's warning system.
Practice having everyone in the family go to your designated area in response to a tornado threat. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking time during an actual emergency situation.Conduct periodic tornado drills, so everyone remembers what to do when a tornado is approaching.
Every building has different safe places. It is important to know where they are and how to get there in an emergency.Check with your work and your children's schools and day care centers to learn tornado emergency plans.
Everyone should know what to do in case all family members are not together. Discussing disaster ahead of time helps reduce fear and lets everyone know how to respond during a tornado.Discuss tornadoes with your family.
bike, motorcycle and rollerblade helmets in your safe area. This way when you have to take shelter the helmets are there waiting for everyone to put on.Keep your
What to Tell Children
Make sure these places are away from windows and tall furniture that could tip over. In your safe place, get under something sturdy, or use a large, hard-cover book to help protect your head and neck from flying or falling objects. Locate safe places outside in case you are not able to go inside. Frequently, children in schools are told to move to the inner hallways away from windows. Children need to know that a tornado safe place is not the same as a fire meeting place.Find safe places in your home and classroom.
Tornadoes can move quickly, blowing objects at very high speeds, even if they are a distance away. Protect yourself from flying debris by taking cover immediately.Wherever you are, if you hear or see a tornado coming, take cover right away.

Make sure there are no windows or glass doors in your safe place and keep this place uncluttered.If you're in a house or apartment building and a tornado threatens, go to the lowest level - a basement or storm cellar if possible. Once on the lowest level, go to the middle of the building away from windows, into a bathroom or closet if possible.
Being under something heavy will help protect you from falling objects. If tornado wind enters the room and the object moves, holding on with one hand will help you move with it, keeping you protected.Get under something sturdy, such as a heavy table, hold on and stay there until the danger has passed.
Your head and neck are more easily injured than other parts of your body. Protect them as much as you can. If you have a bike, motorcycle or rollerblading helmets put them on your children.Use your other arm and hand to protect your head and neck from falling or flying objects.
Sturdy buildings are the safest place to be. Tornado winds can blow large objects, including cars, hundreds of feet away. Tornadoes can change direction quickly and can lift up a car or truck and toss it through the air. Never try to out-drive a tornado. Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable. A mobile home can overturn very easily even if precautions have been taken to tie down the unit.If you're outside in a car or in a mobile home, go immediately to the basement of a nearby sturdy building.
Tornadoes cause a lot of debris to be blown at very high speeds, and you can be hurt by this debris if it hits you. Dangerous flying debris can be blown under highway overpasses and bridges, or weaker overpasses and bridges could be destroyed. You will be safer lying flat in a low-lying area where wind and debris will blow above you. Tornadoes come from severe thunder- storms, which can produce a lot of rain. If you see quickly rising water or flood water coming towards you, move to another spot.If there is no building nearby, lie flat in a low spot. Use your arms and hands to protect your head.
How to Protect Your Property
Having a list will help you remember things that may be broken or blown away in strong winds.Make a list of items to bring inside in the event of a storm.
Make trees more wind resistant by removing diseased or damaged limbs, then strategically remove branches so that wind can blow through. Strong winds frequently break weak limbs and hurl them at great speed, causing damage or injury when they hit. Debris collection services may not be operating just before a storm, so it is best to do this well in advance of approaching storms.Keep trees and shrubbery trimmed.
Branches and firewood may become missiles in strong winds.Remove any debris or loose items in your yard.
Shutters can be closed quickly and provide the safest protection for windows.Consider installing permanent shutters to cover windows.
Garage doors are often damaged or destroyed by flying debris, allowing strong winds to enter. As winds apply pressure to the walls, the roof can be lifted off, and the rest of the house can easily follow.Strengthen garage doors.
Assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit
 Disaster Supplies Kit Basics
The following items might be needed at home or for an evacuation. Keeping them in an easy-to-carry backpack or duffel bag near your door would be best in case you need to evacuate quickly, such as in a tsunami, flash flood, or major chemical emergency. Store your kit in a convenient place known to all family members. Kit basics are:
A portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries.
Flashlight and extra batteries.
First aid kit and first aid manual.
Supply of prescription medications.
