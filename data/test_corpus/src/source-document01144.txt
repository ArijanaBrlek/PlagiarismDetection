The TRK-240 Mobile Display Terminal provides advanced operational features together with a 4 x 40 character message screen for the driver to receive text or 2-way status messages from the dispatcher.
An optional GPS Automatic Vehicle Location device can be internally fitted to provide geographical co-ordinates of the vehicle at preprogrammed intervals and/or on each transmission. The unit is compatible with a wide range of wireless infrastructures. In addition, a credit card reader, bar code scanner, external keyboard or a mobile printer can be attached.
The terminal also allows the user to activate up to 12 keys (with predefined message legends) describing the current activity of the user, e.g. on-site, in-service, out of service. When any of the status keys are activated the message is automatically displayed and transmitted to the base dispatcher using the existing wireless communications system. Audio and visual prompts assist the driver. When the status is received by the base and automatically acknowledged by the base dispatch software, the status key LED stops flashing and the current acknowledged status is displayed. If the status is not properly sent/acknowledged the Quadtec™ protocol continues to send the call automatically until the message gets through.
The system provides automatic number identification, auxiliary control inputs & outputs, status reporting with time stamping, selective calling, audio and visual indicators, GPS integration and many other important features to increase your operating efficiency and fleet control. All of this provides for lower operating expenses by providing the proper information quickly and easily.
The unit has a RS-232/485 port interface, together with digital inputs and outputs for automatic status registration.
The base software system provides a dispatcher with a menu driven Windows based (PC) software suite for tracking vehicle activity and message dispatch. This multi-channel software system provides a dispatcher with the required information in an easy to understand format. In addition to the main tracking screen, customer, vehicle, driver, history and plant views are provided. Comprehensive reporting, printing and setup capabilities are also supplied. The controller can be easily interlaced to any of the industry specific software systems which provide batching, management and accounting & CAD functions.
