Understanding Solar Heating
Solar heating uses the energy of the sun to heat air or water, which can be used for a variety of applications. Active solar-heating uses pumps that move air or liquid from the solar collector directly to a load (such as the building space heating or hot water system) or to storage for use later. Passive solar heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect and distribute heat throughout the building.
