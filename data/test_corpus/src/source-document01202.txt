[] edit Later Pioneer missions (1965-1978)
Five years after the early Able space probe missions ended, used the Pioneer name for a new series of missions, initially aimed at the inner solar system, before the bold flyby missions to and . While successful, the missions returned much poorer images than the five years later. In 1978, the end of the program saw a return to the inner solar system, with the and , this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

The new missions were numbered from Pioneer 6 ().Alternate names in brackets
Pioneer 6 (Pioneer A) - launched December 1965
Pioneer 7 (Pioneer B) - launched August 1966
Pioneer 8 (Pioneer C) - launched December 1967
Pioneer 9 (Pioneer D) - launched November 1968 ()defunct. since 1983
Pioneer E - lost in launcher failure August 1969
Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 0.8 's distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth's. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 1.1 's distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth's. Because they orbit the Sun on either side of the Earth's orbital path, some of them are, from time to time, 180 away from Earth. They can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground based/earth orbiting observatories. If a powerful solar magnetic storm is born, they can warn Earth in advance. AU
