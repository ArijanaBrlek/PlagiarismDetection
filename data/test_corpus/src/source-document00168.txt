A Midsummer Nights Dream  V, i.
A friend once remarked to me that reading Hamlet was like coming home again.  I dont think she was referring to the action of the play  it does contain a homecoming scene  as much as to the warm familiarity of Shakespeare in Western culture.  His words are an enduring gift to the English language and they frame our communication and comprehension.
This summer the Bard of Avon is enjoying a homecoming in upstate New York.  The in Cooperstown has dedicated their entire season to operas that were inspired by or somehow connected to Shakespeare.  In repertory are Bellinis Capuleti e Montecchi (Romeo and Juliet), Handels Giulio Cesare in Egitto , Cole Porters Kiss Me, Kate (about a theatrical company presenting, and living, The Taming of the Shrew ) and Wagners Das Liebesverbot .  Glimmerglass Opera
The latter opera is a reworking of Measure for Measure , which has been in production by the in Franklin, NY.  Its just a coincidence, but it did lead Glimmerglass and Franklin Stage to coordinate some of their publicity. Franklin Stage Company
Measure for Measure , as staged in Franklin by David Bridel, is performed skillfully by a professional cast of four in multiple roles.  The story of a reformer whose crusade to stamp out vice leads him into his own temptations, critics have long felt that Shakespeare began M for M as a high-minded morality play but may have rushed it to conclusion in the guise of a melodrama.  Its one of those works that makes some people suspicious about the authorship of Shakespeares plays, whose inconsistencies may be a sign of collaboration.
Also this season, the is presenting its fifth season of Shakespeare in the Park, staging Othello at the George W. Johnson Park in Endicott and at Binghamton City Stage and the at Cornell Plantations in Ithaca are continuing a summer Shakespeare tradition with a production of King Lear . Endicott Performing Arts Center Red Bull Players
Shakespeare isnt heard much these days.  But back in the summer of 1937 audiences were treated to a season unparalleled in broadcast history.  The NBC and CBS networks found themselves in competition to see who could present the most and best of Shakespeare.  Some of the great Shakespearean actors of the time, including John Barrymore and Orson Welles, were in the cast of radio productions that included The Tempest , Twelfth Night , Taming of the Shrew and, of course, Hamlet (the final two in separate productions on both NBC and CBS). These had to be revised and shortened for broadcast  NBC called its series Streamlined Shakespeare  but that wouldnt have been unusual even in a theater performance, though cut to thirty minutes was a bit drastic.  Since the Elizabethan stage didnt use much scenery or special effects, Shakespeare had to write a lot of description.  That made him one of the most effective and flowing of radio writers: on the radio
NORTH.  How far is it to Berkeley?  And what stir keeps good old York there with his men of war?
H. PERCY.  There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, Manned with three hundred men, as I have heard, and in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley and Seymour  none else of name and noble estimate.
NORTH.  Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
BOLING.  Welcome, my lords&
                            -- Richard II, act II, sc. 3
There are those who believe that if Shakespeare were alive today hed be writing soap operas and police procedurals.  That would have been a waste of genius, but might he have wanted to supplement his income as an occasional uncredited script doctor ?  The practice of written-by-committee can cut both ways.
