A flute-maker could be off a bit due to that kind of error, but not a lot off. The holes are a lot off from being equidistantly spaced.So this is assumption #1 -- but a likely one: The unequalness is deliberate.
The next assumption is also extremely likely to be true: As we humans seem to show, there is a history of The distances between telephone poles; between pickets; between windows on buildings in the architecture of all periods and cultures; between sidewalk slabs; between inches; feet, yards, centimeters -- between ranks and files of all types, etc. We also use 5's and l0's and symmetry a lot (as we have 5+5 fingers and toes).a predisposition toward equality in measurements:
One of the infrequent exceptions to this mental penchant is the historical 5 and 7-note musical scales. One look at a piano keyboard shows that our inclination for equal spacings for intervals between things (musical notes in this case). Not only in Western music, but even throughout history and by widely differing musical cultures. Prof Anne D. Kilmer, head of Dept of Assyriology at U. of Cal., Berkeley, who corresponded with me about this and visited me here some years ago, had deciphered 4,000-year-old cuneiform tablets and it was a song that had harmony (of thirds) to boot!has been ignored or was over-ridden,as being a song in the do, re, mi (diatonic) scale 1
This kind of growing evidence of the utter universality of the unequal-interval pentatonic and/or diatonic scales has upset many musicological apple-carts, but not mine.
Since the distance between fingertips from one tip to another is more or less equal, then the holes in this Neanderthal flute (if Neanderthals have the same mental penchant for easy arithmetic and equidistant repetitions as we do) have been equidistant -- if for no other reason than to fit the convenience of the finger widths.should
INITIAL CONCLUSIONS
To again see this predilection for equality get over-ridden in the making of these holes, therefore, is significant, and leads, even before we make further measurements, to the following (likely) conclusions:
* Firstly, as to the obvious, the Neanderthal flute-maker didn't want a single tone or a sliding "siren-like" kind of sound; so he/she put in holes That's the dividing of the continuum of sound into scales, just like us.so that step-wise discreet or separate notes could be created.
* But the holes were not acceptable to this Neanderthal if they produced just any old notes (as equidistant holes would produce). When we look at history, such a scale would be, and it seems,felt, to be "out of tune" in human musical cultures. [See note below] The reasons for this are profusely examined in my book on music's origins (.wasmost 5 ) The Origin of Music Therefore, the holes (likely) were made with the goal in mind of producing some kind of non-equal scale or set of notes.
* A large number of different scales made from such non-equally divided hole-spacings are possible -- but earlier research that I and others have published over the years indicates that there are reasons based in acoustics and ratios (of vibrations) to conclude that the likeliest scales to be "sought" with such unequal hole-spacings are pentatonic or diatonic scales. Suffice it to say these scales are overwhelmingly parallel to the acoustic "overtone series" and several other acoustic properties 2 -- yet the scales were produced by ancient people with no knowledge of acoustic facts or properties -- other than the responses of their ears. So, therefore,.if the Neanderthal is going to go for an unequal scale, it "probably" would be one of those two types (pentatonic and/or diatonic)
 
Using negative logic, the question arises:If the Neanderthals weren't seeking an unequal scale, why not make the holes equally-spaced?
There are "probably's" and "likely's" in the above, but I think "very" and "extremely" will be supportable adjectives once we look at accepted conclusions in other disciplines (e.g., as above: psychology, history, artifacts, physiology, musicology and acoustics -- to name a few that we will bring to bear on this anthropological-archeological flute find.
 
WHAT NOTES WERE PLAYED ON THE FLUTE?
 
Regarding the actual notes that might have come from the flute: Unless we can know the full original length of the flute, and the placement of holes on it, we cannot know for certain the notes that were played on it. .But all is not lost
Readers may be aware of all, some or none of the following, so excuse me if I assume none.
If you take a length of violin or piano string, and press down in the center (creating what is called a "node" in the string), then each half of the string when played will produce an octave up, of the note of the entire string. A division into thirds makes notes that are called 5ths, and so on.
Similarly, a column of air (inside a wind instrument) can be divided, and each lesser length of air-column can produce other notes, as well. In order to take a long musical horn and get it to produce other notes, we have seen history roll up the horn, and add valves (trumpet) or a slide (trombone) to force into existence differing lengths of columns of vibrating air inside the instrument -- hence creating the different notes in the scale.
The holes in a flute can likewise create these changing lengths of air-columns (and produce different notes). But clearly, if you don't know the full length of the flute, then the holes, representing different columns of air, can't be assigned as being, for example, at the "halfway" point of the full length of the flute (producing an octave up); or at the rd location, and so on. We might have the last 3 or 4 holes, or the middle 4, of the whole flute./13
(again "assuming" we are looking for a diatonic or pentatonic scale). If we assume the scale there (reasonable to do, I think, just from the unequalness of the hole spacings), then the hole spacings might possibly lead to the reconstruction of the full-length flute.The unequal spacings would be our best clue as to which holes they wereis
Again, we are left with the question above: If the Neanderthals weren't seeking an unequal scale, why didn't they make the holes equally-spaced?
(On the other hand, if we assume a particular scale was sought after by the hole-maker, then we cannot reconstruct anything further than the fragment as found.)don't
 
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WHOLE FLUTE
.
First, disregarding for the moment the actual "key" or absolute pitch of notes, the general way in which a flute is made to produce a pentatonic or major diatonic scale is as follows:
Whatever the length of the flute (bone, bamboo, metal, whatever), that length (called L) is divided as follows:
From the blow-end, if no holes are punched, then the flute will produce its fundamental note (and its octave), namely, Do (from the Do, Re, Mi scale).
If you make a holeths of the length of the effective air column, measuring from the blow end (where the slit, reed or mouthpiece is), then you will get the second note, Re, in a rising scale./89
If you make another hole ths from the mouthpiece, the 3rd note, Mi (in the major scale) is formed./45
And so on, until you have produced notes up to Ti. More holes after that would begin repeating the scale an octave higher. 3
.
 
 
We can (which will be necessarily unequally-spaced) as z, y, x, w, v, u, as many as are needed to suit the number of holes. For our purposes, only six holes (plus the two Do's able to be made with all holes closed) will give us the full scale. There is the possibility of an end hole made on the face of the flute rather than made by the exiting of the hollow bore, and the possibility of a flute with 8 holes playing both Do notes.label the distances between the holes
The distances between holes are listed as percentages of the previous hole distance.
(Of course, the Neanderthal bone flute would have been made "by ear," and could not have been made using this kind of mathematical approach. We are here simply creating a comparative "model.")
Each set of any consecutive set of holes (say 4 holes in this example) . If, after trying to account for errors in construction techniques -- a difficult matter to define, we can match the set of holes in the Neanderthal flute to one or another set of consecutive holes in our theoretical or mathematically perfect model of a flute, then , or the like.will exhibit a pattern of relative spacings between them that is unique to those 4we can say the bone flute fragment is part of a flute that plays, for ex., the mi, fa, sol, la part of the do, re, mi scale
(If the Mi part of the scale was missing, or the Fa note is missing, then we would have the pentatonic scale.)
After reaching this point, the measurements will come into play: . Using other distances between holes and re-doing that calculation, and averaging the results, may compensate somewhat for any errors. The result will be approximate, but still very close to what the length would have to have been.actualPicking a distance between holes in actual centimeters, we can use that to find a multiplying factor that will give us the full length of the original flute
So the above, then, is the methodology we have put in place. (A friend, Mike Finley, very knowledgeable in science and math, is now working with me on this).
We don't want to go into such great refinements of this method as to be exceeding the accuracy possible for the Neanderthal flute-makers of that time. However, the flute, because it was found connected to being used in the cave camp-site, was probably not a throw-away (one they made but didn't like) but was one which played acceptable sounds in a scale for them. On this basis, I would expect the holes, if they are meant to reproduce a scale they desired, would have measurements close to what was wanted.
