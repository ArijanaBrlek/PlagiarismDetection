In January, Alexian Brothers Center for Mental Health completed a 3 day, 4 reviewer, random, unannounced audit conducted by DHS' Bureau of Licensure and Accreditation and the ASO (Administrative Service Organization). The results validated our comprehensive and effective clinical programming, our strong documentation practices and our dedication to the treatment of those who suffer from a mental illness. Our solid documentation of services provided resulted in a score that is one of the highest in the state and our "return" amount was less than one half of one percent of our total State annual billings. We continue to strive for the highest quality, compliance and effectiveness to ensure the best services are provided for those we serve.
Congratulations to Alexian Brothers Center for Mental Health's Board Member, State Representative Fred Crespo, for being honored as "Legislator of the Year" by the Illinois Psychological Association. Thank you for your leadership in advocacy for the many in need!
