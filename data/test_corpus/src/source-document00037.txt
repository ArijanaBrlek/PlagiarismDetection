About the Trombone
The first use of the trombone in a symphony was in 1807 in the Symphony in E flat by the Swedish composer Joachim Nicolas Eggert 1, although the composer usually credited with its introduction into the symphony orchestra was Ludwig van Beethoven, who used it in the last movement of his Symphony No. 5 in C minor (1808).
