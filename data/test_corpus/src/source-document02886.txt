Plus (+) or Minus (-) Sign
The ratings from "AA" to "B" may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. Standard & Poor's ratings and other assessments of credit worthiness and financial strength are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issues by an insurer or to buy, hold or sell any security issued by an insurer. In addition, neither a rating nor an assessment is a guaranty of an insurer's financial strength.
