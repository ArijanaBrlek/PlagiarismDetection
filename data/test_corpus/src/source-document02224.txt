Asbestos
Asbestos Related Diseases
Asbestos exposure has been attributed as a root cause for many types of health complications, with some being more serious than others. Many of these complications affect the respiratory system and can impact breathing and lung function. Because symptoms may be similar (i.e. chronic cough, chest pain, or difficulty breathing), it is important to discuss specific situations with a physician, especially for those who have a known asbestos-exposure history.
Mesothelioma
Mesothelioma is by far the most deadly of all asbestos related health complications. Mesothelioma is caused by asbestos fibers which lodge in the mesothelial lining of the body's internal organs, most commonly in the lungs. Mesothelioma can be managed with treatment but currently has no cure and surgical resection is typically difficult because of the proximity of the tumor to vital internal structures such as the heart.
Asbestosis
Asbestosis is a chronic respiratory condition which, like the name indicates, is directly attributable to asbestos exposure. Asbestosis can cause internal respiratory damage that will seriously limit lung function. Asbestosis has also been known to occur as a precursor to mesothelioma and other malignancies such as lung cancer.
Asbestos Lung Cancer
Lung cancer, which is different than mesothelioma because it actually occurs in the lung tissue as opposed to the mesothelium, can also be attributed to asbestos exposure. There are general sub-classifications of lung cancer. These are and which are assigned based on how the cancer cells appear within the lung tissue. Each of these types has appeared in those exposed to asbestos.small cellnon-small cell
Asbestos Cancer
Asbestos cancer is the general term for cancers either directly attributable or partly attributable to asbestos exposure. These malignancies tend to be quite aggressive and affect the respiratory system due to inhaled asbestos fibers. The most common asbestos cancers are mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer. These diseases are a summation of those gathered in our research of world medical literature. This information is medical in nature. A timeline of significant dates in the history of the legal and medical ramifications of asbestos diseases can be found within our section. History of Asbestos Disease
