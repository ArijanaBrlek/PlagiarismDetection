Renegade Training for Fat Loss

Comments
Within the exercise world, the notion of "isolation" is for the most part the norm in virtually every avenue. Exercise facilities are designed in carefully laid out plans with machinery that focuses on certain isolated muscle groups, in essence leading the user from "station to station" so that they can "workout" in an orderly assembly-line like fashion. Typically to the side there is a "cardio" area with treadmills, elliptical, rowers and stair-climbers and a much smaller area for general floor exercises. Depending upon clientele and size limitations, a club might further offer a separate room that houses fitness, yoga and any assortment of this year's (decade's) top exercise class. With this well laid out plan, individuals will enter the facility and proceed through their workout in an orderly and predictable manner ensuring each aspect of their body's development "in isolation" (whether intentional or not). The expanding home gym environment is much the same with cleverly engineered exercise equipment that features multiple stations so that you can; you guessed it, . At this stage of an article on I would typically mention to the reader that given that the world's obesity is growing at alarming rates and health care costs associated with this problem are devastating government and corporate budgets, action is needed. Since this problem has come at the same time as the "exercise revolution," isn't it abundantly obvious and quite logical that one of the greatest obstacles to improving "health and fitness" is the health and fitness industry itself? Simply stated, what is being "done" and recommended is far from what is needed. As you consider this peculiar problem, you will begin to realize that part of the stems from the fact that physiologically nothing occurs in an "isolated" fashion is the body. In fact, I would go as far as to say that somehow the modern exercise industry somehow derailed itself, took isolationist work out of context and forgot the synergistic effect of a properly laid-out plan that will have a greater effect than individual sections ( "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts"). I should also point out it is not the chief culprit in creating the enormous problem but part of a series of pratfalls that has complicated the issue and without serious changes it will be irreversible. How and why the "isolationist" approach came into fashion is anyone's guess. However it relates heavily to our topic of fat loss. While the rationale may be very well steeped in the development of the , the elimination of the "small" independent gym and the gradual movement towards (expensive) exercise machinery, the acceptance of this broad training model (isolation) is deeply entrenched in society and any dissenting voice is far outside the norm. Yet this is where it gets interesting. Through somewhat of a grassroots program, you've seen the public, likely without considering it, move towards a broader notion of "exercise" and begin to return to protocols which stress "harmony". Whether it be "" classes that merge fitness and through compounding lifts and non-conforming objects in a high intensity setting or even a Pilates or Yoga class, there is a growing segment of the public that is starting to implicitly realize that as you abandon notions of strict isolationist work in a stabilized manner, health and fitness can be attained in a fun, addictive and engaging manner. I've even seen this emerge through my writing career. When I first started to discuss the classic Olympic lifts and training complexes they were virtually unseen and now are rather common-place throughout the field. This trend will continue to grow as it spreads to the major gym chains and gains notoriety in the major fitness magazines as well. Slowly small sections of the public are starting to see that the lessons of the past will solve the problems of today. With this in mind I want to approach our using the firm backdrop of promoting health, fitness and total body wellness / internal strength with a regime that will utilize movements to promote total body harmony. The route to is in essence the optimizing of hormonal conditions, primarily dealing with , and . For a weight management program to be truly successful it must address these facts and approach the issue with a three-pronged attack in the following areas: I am quite aware that as I note this area, many will roll their eyes and want to get to the "meat" of training. However, lifestyle has likely been the hidden over-riding cause in creating the problem of obesity. While I have noted the issue of the "evolution" of the training industry coming at the same time as the growth of obesity and cast blame in its direction, it should be stressed that the general quality of life in the same time has nose-dived. Our lives are riddled with physical, emotional and environmental stresses compared to life thirty years ago. And while some may differ on opinion as to the quality of life, there is little debate that stress is one of the greatest concerns of our life. While certainly this area expands far beyond diet, I have made my commentary solely within that section. The issue of "diet" is volleyed back and forth by the media and marketing gurus. Notions and potions are talked about endlessly and peered at through microscopes to prove one theory or the next so that this new-found product can be sold. Whether it is the of the 90's or the of this decade, will go in an out of style like jelly shoes and espadrilles of the 80's and 90's. However what will never go out of style is simple quality foods in normal proportions. While telling people that "diet is simple" won't put you on the best seller list it is an honest fact. This is only a small part of the major diet overhaul I recommend to most individuals, but these ten general rules will go a long way for you. I have intermingled dietary and lifestyle considerations given their close relationship. Within supplementation I draw a very strict line amongst my clients, using a simple grouping of supplements that will have a powerful effect on all of our goals. However I wish to stress that these work hand-in-hand with our dietary choices and are to "supplement" our diet. In addition to a multi-vitamin such as and a quality protein supplement such as I strongly urge the following five daily supplements: Given the focus of this article is fat loss I am going to make the presumption that most concerned readers have had a difficult time maintaining a properly designed program for an extended length of time. It is quite an obvious observation that likely stems from the lack of motivation that in turn relates to the "reward" of training. I won't beat this topic to death with some bravado-laced commentary of how you should like to work hard for the thrill of overcoming your challenges because no matter what, training needs to be "fun". Without the "fun factor" I very much doubt any adult will continue to motivate themselves effectively through the drudgery of "another" training session. However and this is an important word of advice for young training professionals, as you expand upon the "fun factor" your clients will be motivated and hence more likely to garner good results. With this in mind we're going to use a "fun" that is perfectly suited to be used in a "bootcamp" style environment and in fact will likely be more effective in a supportive group setting. Exercises are chosen with a firm understanding of the , are very safe for the exercise newcomer and the majority can be performed in a stationary area. This program is divided into two major sections; (a) and (b) . While the program is designed to fit within a week, with three "standard" sessions that use very basic total-body movements and two further "recovery" sessions. Certainly, you can add additional "recovery" sessions (i.e. perform two or three days in a row) if you are too fatigued or suffer too much muscle soreness. Each training session will commence with one of the simplest and most dependable training mediums that for whatever reasons seems to have be forgotten in the modern exercise work; the . Jumping rope has numerous benefits such as: Your choice of should be simple and I tend to prefer the inexpensive plastic models or leather although I will leave that up to you. Make sure the rope is long enough so that when it's looped under your feet, it will reach chest height. There is no right or wrong way to position your hands when skipping. However, I prefer to pinch my elbows at my sides and position my forearms parallel to the ground which will increase rope speed. Most important, please wear good quality footwear when skipping and make sure you stretch the calves out immediately after finishing rope work. will be performed in both the "Standard" and "Recovery" training days. Within the "Standard" training day it is used within the following circuit. Please note this is a very challenging circuit and technical form should be watched closely throughout. Perform above three to four circuits with 30 seconds rest between circuits. With the mainstay of your resistance work being the Iron Cross, Squat Pull this will account for nine total sets of work. For an additional challenge for "fitter" individuals perform fisted pushups for thirty seconds before jumping jacks and ten pull-ups immediately following jumping jacks. The balance of the three "Standard" training days is made up of a simple "tri" giant set of three basic exercises performed one after the other. These are highly exhausting sets that will last roughly sixty sessions and will leave you very taxed. Rest between sets will be roughly 90 seconds however expect the fatigue factor to be enormous and to maintaining that work rate to be quite the challenge. Please note the weighted section of each of these tri-sets should utilize 40-65% maximum rep for six total reps over three to four sets. At the conclusion at the end of the Standard training sessions the following shoulder capsule work and postural holds will be performed. With the shoulder capsule work two exercises will be performed each session, of three sets each for 12 to 15 repetitions each for a total of six set of shoulder capsule work. With the postural holds, each hold will be done with holds of 15-30 seconds for 2-3 total sets Proper strength training of the shoulder capsule/girdle has been proven to reduce the incidence of injury and improve general posture. These movements should be a part of every exercise regime in re-creating a strong shoulder capsule and some of best time spent for anyone in the gym. Careful attention must be paid to these movements, given their extraordinary importance for your long term health and athletic development. Given that you will be using two exercises per day, I have included five common moves that you can interchange at your own discretion. The "recovery sessions" are designed as the name would imply to help you recover from strenuous activity. They are relatively "simple" workouts that involve the standard rope work, a straight-forward medicine ball routine and should be followed with a static stretch session of roughly thirty minutes. is used within this grouping solely for restorative purposes, utilizing a light ball typically in the four to six pound range. The following circuit should be performed with ten throws for each exercise moving continuously from one movement to the next for a total of two to three circuits. Feet should be shoulder width apart and hips squared directly at the target. With a solid, rooted base and good posture explode ball forward with as much velocity as possible. Pay careful attention to set-up. Opposite hip should be directly facing target. Elbow is high with rear delts pinched back. Twist body back in a to turn with weight transferring to back leg. In an powerful explosive move, twist body, with weight shifting to lead leg. This is same as typical chest pass but starting with one leg behind. Initiate the movement with a powerful step into the target, exploding the ball forward with power generated from your legs (repeat to opposite leg forward). Feet should be shoulder width apart and hips squared directly at the target. With a solid, rooted base and good posture and the body facing target, lift ball behind head and explosively throw ball directly towards target overhead. This is same as typical overhead pass but starting with one leg behind. Initiate the movement with a powerful step into target and throw (repeat to opposite leg forward). Feet should be shoulder width apart and hips squared directly at the target. With a solid, rooted base and good posture with body facing target swing ball up and behind head swing ball above head, then between legs as you push buttocks back (into a neutral position) and then explosively pull hips through and bring ball up above your head slamming the ball straight ahead. With opposite hip facing target hold ball with both hands direct in front of you. Feet should be shoulder width apart and feet intensely rooted. Swing backwards, twisting and looking behind you, transferring weight to back foot with front heel coming off ground. In a swift, powerful action, explosively drive hips through transferring weight to lead leg as target faces target. With opposite hip facing target hold ball with both hands direct in front of you. Feet should be shoulder width apart and feet intensely rooted. Weight transfers to back leg ball as held with opposite hand. In a swift, powerful action, explosively drive hips through transferring weight to lead leg as target faces target. From seated straddle position, twist body, reaching ball behind you and extend back throwing ball to side. Preferably this should be performed with a training partner / trainer where the ball is thrown back with speed, emphasizing the eccentric action.
