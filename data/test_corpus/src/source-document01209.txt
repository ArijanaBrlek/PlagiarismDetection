1. Vinyl is Toxic by Annette Stelmack
AWESOME!! Thank you for a clear and concise reflection on the toxicity of vinyl products. For over a decade, I have been on my soapbox taking a stand against the use of vinyl products for interior finishes and furnishings of any kind. As Bill stated, PVC-products poison the air, water, and soil with dioxins  from birth to grave. Indoor air quality is profoundly affected by the out gassing of the hazardous chemicals during manufacturing and during/after installation of the products. If a fire should breakout, the fumes are deadly. Additionally, vinyl does not breath  moisture is trapped between the sub-flooring, wall board or upholstery leading to the macrobiotic formation of mold. In 2002, after viewing the movie Blue Vinyl I went cold turkey and took a personal stand - no more vinyl for any of my projects and clients  why would we select a known carcinogen for the interior and exterior finishes when there are equal and superiors products that perform the same, or even better. Id love to hear your comments  Annette Stelmack  Sustainable Interior Designer
