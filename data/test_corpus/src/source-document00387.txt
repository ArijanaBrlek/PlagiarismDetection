Our Approach
We believe strongly that each client deserves a vigorous defense. We handle each case, whether it is a misdemeanor or a felony, with the same degree of professionalism and attention to detail.
Even criminal charges that some deem minimal can have lasting repercussions on a person's employment opportunities, civil rights and freedom. Often, it is not the criminal penalty itself, but the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction that can be so damaging. We use our experience and knowledge of the system to seek optimal results for each and minimize adverse consequences of criminal charges.
