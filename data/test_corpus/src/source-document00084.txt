5. If I lose will I have to pay the other side's costs?
You will not automatically have to pay the other side's costs if you lose. Although it does not often do so, the EAT has the power to award costs against a party (or their representative) where appropriate. The circumstances under which it may award costs are set out in Rules 34A and 34C. See also Rules 34, 34B and 34D and . paragraph 19 of the Practice Direction

6. I won at the Employment Tribunal but my employer has appealed – can I make them pay me before the appeal is decided?
You may be able to. If you apply to the County Court to enforce the Employment Tribunal’s judgment you should tell them that your employer has appealed and what the appeal is about. You should contact the County Court for more information.
