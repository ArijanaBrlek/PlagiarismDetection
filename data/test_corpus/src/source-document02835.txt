Employment Opportunities
We are always looking for reliable, friendly, outgoing and enthusiastic individuals with a positive attitude, neat appearance and excellent written and oral communication skills.  If you fit this description, give us a call.  Prior DJ experience is not necessary, as it is easier to train someone from the start than eliminate any bad habits.  We take a unique approach to our work and will provide adequate instruction, training and experience to an applicant with the right qualifications and enthusiasm.
