Equity-Indexed Annuity Returns
Equity-indexed (also know as fixed indexed) annuities are offering very high returns while providing unprecedented protection to the accumulated principal. Many of these accounts have been averaging 8% a year or better with no exposure to downside market risk.
The yearly interest rate used to calculate returns will vary depending on the performance of the chosen index crediting method, but current first year premium bonuses add immediate value to deposits. Bonuses can range from 2-7.5%* depending on the term of the annuity. First year guaranteed returns can be as high as 10%* or more when the premium dollars, increased by the bonus percentage, are invested in the fixed interest sub account within the EIA. First year returns have been even higher in indexed accounts, often approaching 15-20% during bull market cycles.
Example
$100,000 premium plus 7.5%* bonus equals $107,500
$107,500 credited 3.00%* (guaranteed interest in the fixed sub account) equals $110,725.00
The guaranteed first year yield would be 10.73%* in this annuity!
The following year the money could be invested in the equity index sub account. (Issue age up to 75 years old)
