Broadband Satellite Internet:
The Technology
There are several key differences between the broadband satellite Internet services offered by VSAT Systems and the typical satellite Internet service from other providers. Just compare our with our competition and you will notice the difference. satellite Internet service plans
Unlike broadband satellite Internet services that were adapted from television broadcast technology, VSAT Systems service was built from the ground up for IP services. High efficiency TCP acceleration and accelerated TCP handshake enhances performance by mitigating the effects that satellite latency typically has on TCP/IP traffic. A unique feature of VSAT Systems broadband satellite Internet service is its dynamic transmit (Tx) power control feature that automatically increases Tx power when necessary due to weather or atmospheric conditionsNative IP with Acceleration

Dynamic Tx Power Control
Standard satellite Internet transmitters do not automatically manage Tx power, and therefore must be pre-set to a Tx level that will not overpower the satellite transponder on a clear day. When signal strength is threatened by precipitation or other factors, additional power is automatically provided to compensate. The VSAT Systems indoor unit (IDU) is a single-box broadband satellite Internet modem with onboard TCP optimization and QoS (Quality of Service) capabilities, router and DNS. Therefore with a standard transmitter, upload performance can be substantially lower on cloudy or rainy days. Not so with our system.
Advanced Satellite Internet Modem (Indoor Unit)
The unit is centrally managed from our Network Operations Center (NOC) which frees the user from hassles such as software updates. In fact, the IDU can also be managed remotely from the NOC for configuration changes, real-time monitoring and historical reporting. The IDU is compatible with Ku and C band service as well as Ka band service when it becomes available. The VSAT Systems satellite Internet service is also available with a software load that can allow it to operate in site-to-site mode as opposed to its normal site-to-Internet mode. This is important because it means that connecting two sites directly to each other over a single broadband satellite hop is made possible as an option to our standard broadband satellite service.
Although satellite Internet is more secure than a typical broadband connection, additional satellite VPN security is easily accomplished over the VSAT Systems network.Full 3DES VPN Security / Several Options
Optional VSAT Systems 3DES encryption across the satellite Internet space link is the most secure available, allowing the satellite Internet remote site(s) to connect to the VSAT hub over a secure 3DES VPN.
From the hub, the satellite Internet remote site(s) can be directly connected to a corporate headquarters or data center using an IPSec 3DES tunnel. Alternatively, the satellite Internet remote site(s) VLAN or private satellite network can use frame relay or T-1 as a backhaul. For customers requiring a FIPS-140 or HIPAA compliant solution, VSAT Systems also offers a special designed-for-satellite, fully certified client-server VPN. .

VSAT Systems broadband satellite Internet access offers optional network-based QOS prioritization. QoS can be based on protocol type, source port number, destination port number, source IP address or destination IP address. This feature also can provide class based queuing, which assigns a percentage of bandwidth to each class. Rate limiting which allocates only the bandwidth that is needed is used in the network to maximize resources for all customers.Enforced Quality Of Service (QoS)
Perhaps most importantly, the VSAT Systems broadband satellite Internet service can provide a Committed Information Rate (CIR)  with the ability to dedicate bandwidth as required in order to support voice or other bandwidth critical services.
The VSAT systems broadband satellite Internet network uses Turbo Product Code and Forward Error Correction (FEC) with 10-9 bit-error-rate (BER) guarantee. With a simple email, customers have the ability to increase bandwidth (service plan) without any equipment upgrade or site visit. For maximum reliability and performance, 1.2 and 1.8 meter dishes are standard.Advanced Network Features
