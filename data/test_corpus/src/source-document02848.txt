Exercise Instructions:
Grasp a barbell at shoulder width apart using an underhand grip and sit down on the end of a flat bench. Rest the back of your forearms on the top of your thighs so that your wrists are just off the end of your knees (as demonstrated in the video above). Bending only at the wrists, let the barbell drop as far as possible. This is the starting position for the exercise. Slowly raise the bar up as far as possible squeezing the forearm muscles at the top of the movement. Pause, then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.
Tips & Advice:
Keep the rep timing slow, and pause/squeeze the forearms up the top for a count of two at the top of the movement for added intensity. Use a full range of motion by allowing the weight to drop as far as possible at the bottom of the movement.
