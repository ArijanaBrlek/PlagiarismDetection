The MTA network links the diverse parts of New York, giving the region efficient, reasonably priced, environmentally sound travel alternatives to gridlocked streets and highways.
While nearly 85 percent of the nation's workers need automobiles to get to their jobs, four of every five rush-hour commuters to New York City's central business district avoid traffic congestion by taking transit service  most of it operated by the MTA. MTA customers travel on America's largest bus fleet and on more subway and rail cars than all the rest of the country's subways and commuter railroads combined.
It is impossible to place a dollar figure on the MTA's land, equipment, and facilities, located on or under some of the world's most expensive real estate. But the greatest value of the MTA lies in its beneficial impact on the New York region's economy and quality of life. New York ranks near the top among the nation's best cities for business, Fortune magazine has written, because it has what every city desires. A workable mass transit system. The mobility provided by the MTA helps ensure New York's place as a world center of finance, commerce, culture, and entertainment.
Since 1982 the MTA has been carrying out America's most extensive transportation rebuilding project. With funding by federal, state, and local government and by the issuance of bonds, the MTA has replaced or overhauled nearly all of the subway, railroad, and bus fleets; rebuilt maintenance shops and much of the 2,000 miles of subway and railroad track; rehabilitated scores of subway and railroad stations; and restored Grand Central Terminal and the LIRR's Penn Station.
MetroCard automated fare collection and E-ZPassÂ® electronic toll collection revolutionized payment on subways, buses, bridges, and tunnels. MetroCard brought free transfers between subways and buses, multiride bonuses, and weekly, monthly, and daily transit passes, reducing the cost of public transportation for the first time. E-ZPass transformed regional travel, decreasing congestion, reducing pollution, and speeding commutation.
The results include significant improvements in performance, higher levels of efficiency, and vastly improved reliability, including new highs in Mean Distance Between Failures (the distance rail cars and buses travel between breakdowns), on-time service, ridership, and wait times at bridge and tunnel toll plazas.
The MTA is continuing its rebuilding and improvement efforts with its 2005-2009 Capital Program and will move forward on the first substantial expansion of the network in 60 years, including Long Island Rail Road access to Grand Central, the uptown segment of a full-length Second Avenue subway, the extension of the number 7 line west from Times Square to the Javits Center, and a direct link from Kennedy Airport to downtown Manhattan.
A public-benefit corporation chartered by the New York State Legislature in 1965, the MTA is governed by a 17-member Board. Members are nominated by the Governor, with four recommended by New York City's mayor and one each by the county executives of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Dutchess, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam counties. (Members representing the latter four cast one collective vote.) The board also has six rotating non-voting seats, three held by representatives of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee (PCAC), which serves as a voice for users of MTA transit and commuter facilities, and three held by representatives of organized labor. All Board members are confirmed by the New York State Senate.

When the subway opened in 1904, it launched an unprecedented era of growth and prosperity for the newly unified New York City. One hundred years later, the city's reliance on its underground rapid transit system is greater than ever. NYC Transit keeps New York moving 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as its subways speed through underground tunnels and elevated structures in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. On Staten Island, NYC Transit's Staten Island Railway links 22 communities.
Motor-bus service on the streets of Manhattan began in 1905. Today, NYC Transit's buses run in all five boroughs, on more than 200 local and 30 express routes. They account for 80 percent of the city's surface mass transportation.
NYC Transit also administers paratransit service throughout New York City to provide transportation options for people with disabilities.
MetroCard, the MTA's automated fare collection medium, is accepted on all New York City Transit subway stations and on buses. It can also be used on Long Island Bus, MTA Bus, and on the PATH system (operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey), a subway linking New York and New Jersey.
Among NYC Transit's capital projects are additional new subway cars and a state-of-the-art communication-based signal system to replace mechanical signals dating to 1904.
