Streaming technology has come a long way over the past few years. Consider this:
In the US alone, each month there are over 11 billion views of online video.
More than 150 of the Fortune 200 have streaming video on their public web sites.
63% of business people report accessing online video at least once per week
78% of them say video makes content more compelling
Today, using only standard hardware and software, users all over the world can access high quality video and audio, along with integrated PowerPoint slides, downloadable study guides and other written materials.
Streaming makes sense when there are too few sites to justify the expense of a satellite network infrastructure, when you are trying to reach "external" audiences (such as customers, prospects, investors, the press, etc.), and when you have sites that are outside your satellite network coverage. In fact, many BI clients "simulcast" via satellite and the Web to reach their worldwide locations.
