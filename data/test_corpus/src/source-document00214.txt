For years we have talked about business men who are closet poets.   Wallace Stevens by day was a Connecticut insurance executive, but -- by day and night -- he was an accomplished poet.  These days we find many CEOs who write poetry and even more who love it.  We suspect, too, that you will be seeing more poetry in business documents, as men and ladies of substance try to defy the world of spin that puts such a pall on discourse throughout the darkened world.  Poetry, for sure, is the best way we've got of banishing euphemism and the world of words without meaning.
Everybody has their hand in a production of WGBH, the Poetry Foundation, etc.  On the website you can get readings of Frost, Billy Collins, Emily Dickinson, etc.  The overlay from WGBH, including the graphic that begins each reading, is downright fruity and annoyinga lot of frosting that gets in the way of the poetry.  The selections are often poor, and the readers sometimes pathetic.  But we can recommend to you reading his own, in this case Touch Me.   It does.  (11/19/08)

The Bard of Dundee, William Topaz McGonagall, was known as the worlds worse poet, but ever ventured forth with his verse in the late 19th century.  (See the , May 17-18, 2008, pp. A1 and 8.)  Nonetheless, at a recent auction, some daft collector paid about $13,000 for a good portion of his work.  The William Topaz McGonagall Appreciation Society boosts more than 200 members&.  His work has been translated into Russian, Japanese, and Romanian.   Today, Edinburgh and Dundee fight for the honor of claiming the poet as their own, better honoring him that Robert Burns himself whose memorial is in .  (7/2/08)

Robert Jr, West Point graduate, retired Army colonel, sometime Citibank employee, who was once fired by New York City Transit, is back in to head New Yorks buses and subways (, May 15, 2007, p. A26).  Roberts intends to have a stanza from Two Tramps posted on his office wall.  The poem is a meditation on the things a person does out of necessity and the things he does because he chooses to.   Only where love and need are one, / And the work is play for mortal stakes, / Is the deed ever really done / For Heaven and the futures sakes.   (8/8/07)Two Tramps in Fashion

. 76 George Lawrence is a very vibrant fellowsometimes a journalist, sometimes a publisherfrom and of North Carolina.  Though hes wide angle, he reminds us that North Carolina is a state of small villages that discovers its greatness within town limits. Its said that its all right to go to a local builder for a $300,000 house but no more: you can spend more, but youll still wind up with a $300,000 structure.  All the public parking lots at big buildings and malls are thought to have been designed by one guy with one pen: they are fiendishly hard to get around, all to make sure you go nowhere fast.  They are so frustrating that even retired oldsters speed across them, causing the occasional fender bender.  This is a place where, even if you have a lot of land around you, youre crowded.  Somebody fences you in.  Its a coffin of the mind.  George would deny it, but this inveterate localism is what we think he writes about.  (6/6/07)George Lawrence: Three by Five

Do you have Images in mind Nagging nagging nagging, Seem so familiar and yet You cant figure out where You got them?
You see them, feel them, sense Them so real, tugging like your very home, So perfect you swear Until it dawns on You: they are From Your Dreams.

. 75 We have long been focused on the connection between afflicted souls and artistic merit.  The poems of the Romantics often ask the right question: the poet wonders whether he is blessed by divine madness or just going out of his cotton-pickin mind.  In the early 1980s one Eileen Simpson authored , which touched on something often spiedthe artists migration from expressive exuberance in youth to something more sinister as middle age sets in.  She calls on Wordsworths famous line:  We poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness.   Married to and a psychotherapist herself, Simpson saw the craziness of a whole clutch of poets who visited with, fought with, and gossiped about their fellow journeymen.  We are always wondering whether any artist who has lost his affliction through some sort of lobotomy can generate anything divine.  Its amazing the number of painters who have bad eyesight.  The upsides of downsides seem to occur frequently in creative pursuitsan affliction creates the circuitry that leads to unusual compositions.  (5/30/07)Gladness to Madness

In January 2006, Shigureden Museum opened in Kyoto, financed by the longtime head of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi.  Featured is the , an anthology of 100 poems by 100 poets.  Journalist is much taken with Super Marios Temple. The museum is dedicated to the poetry card game uta karuta.  The basic deck for uta karuta is the Hyakunin Isshu, a compilation of one hundred poems by one hundred poets originally assembled by the thirteenth-century imperial poet Fujiwara Teika.  During the Edo era (16031867), the poems began appearing on playing cards in the houses of Samurai and Shogun nobles, and a game soon emerged in which a reader would sing the lines of a poem and players would scramble to be the first to pick up the matching card.  Over the centuries, uta karuta grew into one of Japans most popular pastimes; memorizing the poems remains part of the curriculum in some Japanese schools.Ogura Hyakunin Isshu David Sax

The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelts Darkest Journey
As his temperature once again began to rise sharply, Roosevelt fell into a trancelike state, and he begin to recite & the opening lines to Samuel Taylor Coleridges &  Kubla Khan : In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree&.   (p. 297) 
By this point in the expedition, Roosevelt had already read and discarded every book in his small traveling library and was desperate for new reading material.  He finally resorted to reading Kermits , even though he was unimpressed by it&.  After tearing through the book of English verse as he lay burning with fever Roosevelt turned, with great reluctance, to the book of French verse, which he considered to be better than nothing, but just barely&.  For French verse father had never cared.  He said it didnt sing sufficiently.  The Song of Roland  was the one exception he granted, Kermit wrote.  (p. 312) Oxford Book of English VerseWe would wager that Roosevelt was the only president that read poetry and debated its merits while sick and off on a life-threatening expedition.  (11/29/06)
71.Okie Poet of Love
Currently, Yevtushenko divides his time between Russia and Oklahoma, where he teaches at the University of Tulsa.  I don't teach literature, he said, I teach compassion through poetry and film.  He has been working on an exhaustive anthology of Russian poetry from the 10th century to the present.  See   I didn't become popular as a political poet, but as a poet of love.  But, as I said, I think intellectuals have a moral responsibility to speak up. [On March 6] I didn't sleep.  In Moscow, an old Cuban man was killed.  He was a cigar roller.  He was killed by some teenagers, some skinheads, nationalists.  I was so ashamed.  My poemDeath of a Cigar Rollerwas published earlier this month in Russia in Novye Izvestiya.  I also called a radio station in Moscow and recited this poem to hundreds of thousands of Russians.  I hate any kind of aggressive nationalism.  Thats why I wrote Babi Yar, many years ago.   (9/20/06) Theres A Danger in Love Poetry.
There are, I believe, only three countries in Europe where the name of poet is everywhere honoured rather than ridiculed.  First comes Ireland, where for over two thousand years the master-poet was also the historian, doctor, musician, magician, prophet, Chief Justice and Counsellor to the Kindand ranked high above soldiers and sailors.  Next, Wales, where the poetic tradition of the Eisteddfod or National Poetic Congress has outlasted even the English conquest.  Finally Hungary.  I am Irish by birth, Welsh by adoption, and Hungary has always brought me good luck, I suppose also because of its poetic tradition.  Why are there about twenty times more poems written and published in Hungary per head of the population than in any other country?  Hungary has survived conquest and enslavement not by the help of religion or politics but by poetryas in Ireland and Wales.  Hungarian poets have, however, a quality unmatched by any other European racetheir language and their myths being completely different from any other.  Thus they cannot get lost under the domination of neighboring powers, few of whose citizens ever take the trouble to learn Magyar.  Hungarians, like the ancient Irish and Welsh, realize that poetry is a means of storing power: notably the magical power of love. See Robert Graves, Address to the Poets of Hungary, Budapest, 1970. 
. 70 Where Poetry Flourishes
 We refer you also to ,where we note that the great General Bem was celebrated by Hungarian poet Sandor Petofi. Poetry in Hungary has been intimately connected to the quest for liberty.  Za wolno[ Graves is on to something here.  We have noted in and in other articles that the best, most original ideas in the world seem to be coming from countries at the margin which are falling off the map.   Since the end of the Cold War the giant nations which have dominated the world look like arthritic elephants, and the nations we forget about are making tracks.  (9/13/06) Just One Fish in the Big Pond

.Afghan Poetry Readings
Afghan immigrants to the U.S. have brought something special with themthe ancient custom of poetry readings.  But rival groups clash over the poetry, debating about which is the right stuff to read.  In Washington D.C. there are two societies (Sufis vs. the Dervishes), and they dont have much love for one another.  See the , July 10, 2006, pp.A1 and A8.  Poetry reading has deep roots in Afghan culture; the art form began more than 1,000 years ago in the ancient cities of Central Asia.   (8/30/06)Wall Street Journal
Ted Kooser seems all right: he comes from the great out thereIowa and Nebraskaand did time in an insurance company like Wallace Stevens.  Donald Hall is our new Poet Laureate, and he may be a worry.  Came from New Haven, and did prison time at Harvard and Oxford, so he has overdone the noxious academic fumes.  We like a few lines from a simple poem, "Ox Cart Man": 68

When the cart is empty he sells the cart. When the cart is sold he sells the ox, harness and yoke, and walks home, his pockets heavy with the years coin for salt and taxes,

We have noticed over the years that the Irish have a little extra poetry in their lives.  Indeed, we have seen more than one annual report from Irish businesses with both blarney and poesy.  We were recently most pleased to stumble on some poetry winners under that mightily pleased our palate.  One Fintan OHiggins took first prize with The Oyster and the Pint : 67

A pretty young oyster heaved a sigh  and addressed a pint of Guinness, How can we bivalves express ourselves when our glory is cloistered within us ? 
It goes without saying that the pervasive Guinness is mixed up in all the awards, loosening the tongue and guiding the hand: 
The winners of the BIM Guinness Quality Oyster Awards Poetry competition were announced at the Ballylongford Oyster Festival.  The winning poets were wined and dined before the prize giving on September 16, 2005.  The judging panel was lead by Billy Keane, son of the late John B Keane. The competition was supported by .  Poetry Ireland This interplay between Main Street and High Street reminds us of  The language of poetry and advertisingan interdisciplinary teaching project at Hamburg University where examine poetry in advertising, and advertising in poetry.  Both are sometimes richer for the interchange.  In any event, we would contend that poetry could recharge the language of business which has been perverted by Powerpoints, consultants nostrums, and the power of euphemism.  (5/31/06) Martin Klepper and Ingrid Piller

.Hedge Fund Poets
Now that hedge funds have become a dime a dozen, their managers, who at best are lingo limited communicators, are trying to become golden warblers as they sing to their limited partners and potential investors.  Most are simply trying to move beyond opaque, tongue-tied prose.  But one Michael Roth of in Milwaukee has burst into doggerel poetry, and has achieved every money managers dream, making it on to the front page of the , February 16, 2006 in Why Hedge Funds Are Feeling the Need to Burst into Poetry. You can sample his October-Stark Ravin Bad, if you are so inclined, through a link provided in the article: the darn thing just goes on and on.  Apparently, many of these would-be authors want to emulate Warren Buffetts style and fame whose annual reports traditionally have done a pretty good job of putting a good face on his company and its performance.  We once told him that hes about the best investor relations professional around.  (3/29/06) Stark Investments Wall Street Journal

John Barr, now head of a transformed Poetry Foundation, is half a poet and half an investment banker.  He leans towards poets who are engaged at several levels with the world, not those totally given over to their interior lives.  Ours, of course, is not a contemplative age anyway.  We suspect we need more monk poets.  In this with Wharton on January 26, 2005, he talks about his kind of poet who is very much a man of affairs:64
.No Barr to Business
interview
I might start with William Butler Yeats, who many believe to be the greatest English-language poet of the 20th century.  He had a poem that was published as he was approaching middle age called The Fascination of What's Difficult.  The point of my story is that Yeats had a life outside of poetry.  He was a founder of the Irish National Theater in Dublin, for example, and the poem talks about the aggravations of trying to put on a play, with actors quitting and budgets overrunall the stuff that we all deal with in running a businessand how he reconciles that.  And he doesn't really reconcile it.  He understands that poetry is like a horse in a sheda reference to Pegasuswaiting to break through the doors and run off, literally fly off as a winged horse.  Any poet who has spent a life out there trying to do things in the external world, like Yeats with the Irish Theater, is likely to capture things that you just asked about.  So I tend to go with poets like that.
There is the problem here, of course, that when you stick a cucumber in brine, it always comes out a pickle.  (2/15/06)

Ted Kooser is a plain spoken Nebraskan who just happens to have turned into a Poet Laureate.  His poetry lacks the overladen agenda that besets urban poets situated on the coasts.  Lest beginning poets persist in the belief that poetry will lead to riches, he lets them know right off there is no money in it (, February 8, 2005, p. D9).  A retired life insurance executive (shades of Wallace Stevens), Mr. Kooser has wisely never relied on poems for a living.    We are amused by his Selecting a Reader :  First, I would have her be beautiful, / and walking carefully up on my poetry  /at the loneliest moment of an afternoon, / her hair still damp at the neck / from washing it. Who wouldnt want a beautiful gal with wet locks to just wander up to his poetry?  (10/19/05)Wall Street Journal
58.Christopher Fry
Christopher Fry was an elegant poet/playwright but in an age where Thespians have been given over to prose.  He had a long life, appropriate for someone of a comic sensibility.  In declining England, it was other angry young, bleak playwrights who took over the stage and pushed him out of the limelight halfway through his career.  His verse dramas only gave him a brief moment of fame, but we can see poesy plays coming back, for the best days of Greek drama were the early ones where rhythmic choruses ruled the roost.  About poetry Fry said,Poetry has the virtue of being able to say twice as much as prose in half the time, and the drawback, if you do not give it your full attention, of seeming to say half as much in twice the time.  And he knew what the moon was for:The moon is nothing but a circumambulating aphrodisiac divinely subsidized to provoke the world into a rising birth-rate.   We have always been taken by the title of his The Lady's Not for Burning , a play that much later came to be linked in jest to Margaret Thatcher.  We would have given our eyeteeth to see the John Gielgud West End production, which also featured a young Richard Burton and Claire Bloom and who were reputed to be electric together.  Were sure any one of the players could have said: I shall be loath to forego one day of you.  Read about its opening in 1948, its move over to the Globe in the West End in 1949, and its vast success at the Brooks Atkinson in New York.  Everything Fry did was thick with language, and you can hear the words even if you are merely reading him.  See .  He died June 30 in Chichester.  www.guardian.co.uk/arts/curtainup/

To our very great surprise, the landmarks that commemorate Scotlands premier poet Robert Burns are in tatters, perhaps soon to be ashes.  See , January 22, 2005, p. 53.  His birthplace, a cottage in Alloway, Ayr, is rundown.  Original manuscripts in out-of-date displays are alternately baked by heating from below and bleached by sunlight from above.  &  Elsewhere in Ayrshire, the Burns Monument in Kilmarnock was burned by vandals last years and a three-story tower in Mauchline billing itself as the Burns National Monument is chained shut.   Obviously the famously thrifty Scots want their verse free, much the case in many places.  (6/8/05)The Economist

Rita Dove has to be an object of no little satisfaction to any poet with a love for tempo who wants an example of someone who has challenged the introverted disposition that enriches and plagues poets all.  She called dancing a corrective to her own shyness.  Egocentrism is the privilege of the dancing couple, Dove said. If Im feeling shy, I never wear neutral colorsgive me red or lime or turquoise!   See , Dance Fever, November 21, 2004, p. 9.  Poet and competetive ballroom dancer, Dove mixes the arts or mixes her media, if you like, to great effect.  We suspect more and more artists will want to perform in different media, going forward, since oddly enough, that seems to be the key to creativity in a multimedia age and to be therapeutic as well for the individual artist.   For Dove, dance is an implicit parallel to poetry.  Dance is very much part of her poems offered up in .  See her homepage at .  Her husband, of German background, is a novelist and scholar in residence at the University of Virginia.  We think its one title, Ta Ta Cha Cha, that most easily expresses the dance of life in her poetry.

We have previously remarked on John Barr, an investment banker who has taken  over as king at the Poetry Foundation,  now unfortunately renamed the Modern Poetry Association, a moniker which sounds dangerously close to the politically correct Modern Language Association.  (See )  Hes just been interviewed by an online publication, Knowledge@Wharton, where the questioner tries to get at the  impact business and poetry have upon one another.  Barr opines: That sense of art expanding to the limits of human experience makes for a better decision-maker in the business world, because it tends to offset the tendency to reduce every business question to a simple algorithm or a simple proposition that we can boil down and make a decision about.   ( The tendency to simplify has to be balanced by a passion not to injure the complexity of the full fabric. )  52 .

Any poet who has spent a life out there trying to do things in the external world, like Yeats with the Irish Theater, is likely to capture things that you just asked about.  So I intend to go with poets like that.   Poetry, Barr implies, is all the stronger when the poet is very much mixed up in the business of life. 
There is an essential difference between business and art or poetry in terms of the attitude towards risk.  I think businessmen seek as much return for as little risk as possible&.  Artists, on the contrary, have to enhance risk to succeed.  See Knowledge@Wharton at .

Poets House
We understand this archive to be a hidden space in a nondescript office building on New Yorks Spring Street.  But it may be that the poetry movement can only flourish in disguise hidden behind anonymity, just as subterranean errant culture was concealed from the all-prying state in Orwells .  That said, Poets House, set up by Stanley Kunitz and Elizabeth Kray in 1985, is a scramble of activity with a horde of activities on its program, the Directory of American Poetry Books online to keep track of poets on the loose, and an alliance with libraries and others to encourage poetry events nationwide.  Poets House. 72 Spring Street, 2d Floor.  New York, New York 10012.  212-431-7920.  We uncovered it, because a jazz performer chose to have his wedding there. . 1984 www.poetshouse.org

Poetry Therapy for Businesspeople
Ive been writing poetry for a couple of years now, having not done anything since I was at school in the fifties.  During the sixties and until about ten years ago, I was a stockbroker and corporate financier.  I now run think tanks for Chief Executives in the UK. Ive also developed a 90 minute workshop which I deliver as a precursor to deep issue sessions.  The is that once guys have opened up to each other by reciting (their) poems, theyve nothing to hide so we get teams transforming themselves after a very short time.  I call this Poetry in Business and have used it to great effect with banks, industrialists and museums.

 And he has a poem to tell you how this all works miracles for company persons:   
Corporate PoetryGetting to the Point 
Poetry flows Poetry connects Poetry communicates Its joys and woes To an ever increasing and ever Voracious group of individual souls. 
Manic issues evolved over long frayed Tantrums in the night and day Of corporate life can be And are Distilled, fumigated, analysed and Even resolved by forcing them Elegantly through the sieve of Heartfelt poetry. 
The poetry of the immovable Juxtaposed with the poetry of the solution Solved, determined, extracted, Alive.

Our recent correspondence is full of examples of what happens when we and history take a holiday from one another.  The Wall Street poet Eugene Schlanger, who is by day counsel at a Wall Street firm, tells us of 8 Mute Minimal Designs,the proposed new edifices at Ground Zero that totally blot out any memory of 9/11/01: . 45
Abolition of Memory
           Where is the twisted human torso?            Where are the flames?  Where is the smoke?            What crossed fingers still dangle below            These calm subterranean spaces?
           Should we not, here and now, make known the            Inexplicable agony?  Who among these            Names leaped to their deaths?
