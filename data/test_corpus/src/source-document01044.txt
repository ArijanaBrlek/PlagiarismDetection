Limit your snack intake to one (1) per day. Snacks should NOT take the place of a Medifast Meal or Lean & Green Meal.
*NOTE: Eating more than one (1) snack per day may hinder weight loss. For information on slower weight loss, please refer to our (PDF file). Plateau Tips
This is not recommended. In order to maximize effectiveness and to ensure that you get all the nutrition your body requires, the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan (5 Medifast Meals plus 1 Lean & Green Meal) should be followed  unless otherwise recommended by your physician. Can I substitute a sixth Medifast Meal for my one Lean & Green?

The Cream of Tomato Soup is the only product that contains MSG. Do any Medifast products contain MSG?
Medifast uses a combination of fructose and acesulfame potassium to sweeten most products. This combination is used because we have found it to make the best quality products without contributing significantly to calories, sugars or carbohydrates. For more information about acesulfame potassium, How does Medifast sweeten its products? click here.
There are sugar alcohols in some flavors of Medifast Bars (Caramel Nut and Plus for Diabetics Bars). Momentum by Medifast Flavor Infusers are sweetened with Sucralose and do not contain acesulfame potassium.
Medifast 55 Shakes have 90 calories and 11g of protein. Medifast 70 Shakes have 100 calories and 14g of protein. Medifast 55 Shakes are recommended for women. Medifast 70 Shakes are recommended for men and for women who are active or prefer a higher protein count. Whats the difference between Medifast 55 and Medifast 70 Shakes?
Most Medifast Meals do not contain any stimulants, ephedrine, or other herbs that might be harmful to your body. Are there any stimulants in the Medifast Products?
Our Momentum by Medifast product line contains 100 mg of caffeine and 90 mg of EGCG, a potent antioxidant found in green tea. This amount of caffeine is equivalent to 1 cup of brewed coffee. Using Momentum products is a lifestyle choice, so if you would rather not consume EGCG and additional caffeine you may choose other Medifast products. Momentum products are only included in Variety Packages that are labeled Momentum, and not in our standard Variety Packages for Women, Men and Diabetes.
Weight loss programs are generally not covered by medical insurance, but please check with both your doctor and your insurance carrier for information relative to your individual circumstances. Some policies may cover weight loss programs in conjunction with specific medical conditions (such as primary diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or heart disease) in which obesity is a factor and weight loss can lead to management or improvement of these conditions.  But again, you will need to ask your doctor and your insurance carrier this question in order to receive an accurate answer based on your coverage and medical status.

Starting Medifast
You should consult with your physician or qualified medical practitioner prior to beginning (and throughout the course of) any weight loss program. Youll want to order at least a 2-week supply (a 4-week supply is ideal) of Medifast Meals before you start, then continue ordering on a monthly basis. Schedule your re-orders at least one (1) week in advance so you dont run out of Medifast Meals. How do I get started on Medifast?
Yes. There are numerous vegetarian options available within the Medifast Meal lineup. For specific information, refer to our complete list of (PDF file).  You can substitute for the LEAN portion of the Lean & Green Meal. Additional Meatless Options are available on our (PDF files).  Low carbohydrate vegetables used in conjunction with your Lean & Green Meal can be referenced through our (PDF file). Can I do the program if I am a vegetarian?

The first three days are critical to your success, so pick a start date that makes sense for your schedule. You might want to look for a time when you dont anticipate any family, work-related or other social-type events that involve food. When should I start my Medifast program?
Medifast recommends planning ahead so you can continue your program while vacationing. If your meals arent with you, you cant eat them! This may necessitate packing food items in your luggage. Pre-planning can help you continue to lose weight while you travel. Customers who are able to plan and continue the program while traveling or ordering out get the best results.  Traveling presents countless eating temptations, with the availability of foods that are not part of the Medifast program. Always remember your end goals -- a healthier weight and a healthier lifestyle. If youre unable to follow your current 5 & 1 Plan, you can try a 3 & 2 Plan (3 Medifast Meals plus 2 Lean & Green Meals). Remember to limit portion sizes in your Lean & Green Meals - and enjoy your travel! What should I do when on vacation?
If your vacation involves strenuous activity (e.g., skiing or bicycling), you may contact Nutrition Support for advice about incorporating additional calories to help prevent fatigue.
You may stay on the 5 & 1 Plan until: How long can I stay on the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan?
youve lost your desired amount of weight  
you develop a new contraindication to the program (such as pregnancy)
your physician recommends you transition into Maintenance Plan
If you have significant weight to lose and plan to be on the weight loss phase of the program beyond 16 weeks, we recommend that your physician monitor your program.  After youve completed the weight loss phase, you will transition into the Maintenance Plan. Nutrition Support at Medifast is available to guide you in this transition if you need assistance. 
For general health, it is recommended that you stop smoking. Most individuals cannot successfully stop smoking and start a weight loss diet at the same time. Once you are no longer smoking, a weight loss program, like Medifast, is highly recommended. I'm trying to quit smoking -- could this affect my results with Medifast?
Using Medifast
Every 2-3 hours. It is important to start each day with a schedule, allotting specific times for eating your meals. Build six (6) time slots for meals into your daily schedule, and strive to be as consistent with this eating schedule as possible. If you know your schedule will shift a little (perhaps on weekends), make sure to shift your meal times accordingly. How often should I have my Medifast Meals?
If you miss a meal, eat the rest of your meals closer together to make sure you get all the required meals in before the end of the day. Because of the low caloric level of Medifast, skipping meals will put you below the optimal nutrient level your body needs to function. This decrease in your nutrient balance makes your body conserve energy -- causing you to lose weight slower, not faster! What happens if I miss a meal?
It is important to get all 5 Medifast Meals plus 1 Lean & Green Meal in each day; otherwise, you are not getting all the nutrition and calories required to maximize the 5 & 1 Plans effectiveness. What if I dont feel hungry?
If you happen to run out of Medifast Meals prior to the arrival of your next Medifast shipment, please contact our Nutrition Support team at . What if I run out of Medifast?

Generally speaking, you shouldnt need to take vitamin supplements along with the program. The Medifast 5 & 1 Plan provides you with all the necessary Recommended Daily Allowances of vitamins and minerals. Address this matter with your physician if you are currently taking additional doctor-prescribed vitamin and/or mineral supplements. Should I take vitamins?
Medifast powdered products have an 18-month best-if-used-by date. Medifast Ready-to-Drink Shakes and Bars have a 12-month best-if-used-by date.  This does not mean that the product will expire, "go bad" or be harmful; it simply means that the vitamin and mineral pre-mix contained in the products may lose some of its potency, potentially rendering the product less effective. For best results, use your Medifast Meals as soon as possible and store them in a cool, dry, clean environment. Can Medifast Meals be consumed after the best-if-used-by date?
Use water for all Medifast Meals that require mixing. For specific information, refer to our complete list of (PDF File). Can you provide mixing instructions for each Medifast Meal?
Mixing Instructions
Yes. This can be a useful technique to get you through a challenging time if you are feeling hungry. Some customers say this helps them to stay on the program successfully. Remember, however, it is most beneficial to spread individual meals out throughout the day. Can you mix two Medifast Meals together?
Medifast Meals are quick and easy to prepare whenever you're ready to eat them. You may choose to prepare certain Meals (such as the soups) ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator or a Thermos. We recommend preparing the Meal no more than a few hours before consumption and thoroughly mixing the Meal prior to eating to prevent any settling that may occur. Can I mix my Medifast Meals ahead of time?
You might also be interested in Medifast Ready-to-Drink Shakes, which offer a convenient way to take your shakes with you. These pre-mixed shakes are shelf-stable, can be stored easily and are interchangeable with your other Medifast Meals.
Absolutely! While on the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan for weight loss, we recommend that you avoid fruits, dairy and starches because of their high carbohydrate contents. However, these foods are very healthy for you and we encourage you to re-introduce all fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy products and whole grain products during the Transition and Maintenance phases of your weight loss journey. Will I ever be able to eat fruit, dairy or starches again?
We recommend that you stay with a single brand of products (such as Medifast products). Each Medifast product is formulated to provide you with the complete nutrition your body requires. Mixing in different product brands may lead to nutrient deficiencies. Can I combine other brands of diet foods?
It is important to drink at least 64 ounces of water per day while on the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan to keep your body hydrated. How much water should I drink on this program?
We recommend drinking 64 ounces of water per day. In addition, you may drink any liquids that are considered non-caloric, which would include Medifast Flavor Infusers. This also includes hot or iced tea, coffee or decaf, diet sodas or other calorie-free beverages. As a general rule, Medifast recommends that you try to drink as much water as possible for good health, and limit your intake of other non-caloric liquids when possible. What types of fluids are recommended?
unsweetened
Alcoholic beverages are not recommended on the Medifast program. Alcohol provides unneeded calories, can slow your weight loss, stimulates the appetite (encouraging additional food intake) and can deplete your body of needed water. because these also provide calories with no nutritional value. Those who choose to drink alcohol tend to feel its effects at lower consumption levels, due to the lower calorie level of the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan. Can I drink alcohol?
Low carbohydrate versions of beer and other types of alcohol are not recommended
The manufacturing of a solid product requires a different processing method for binding the carbohydrates with proteins. This results in a slightly higher carbohydrate level than the powdered Medifast products. Hence, limit your bar intake to one (or less) per day during the weight loss phase of your plan. Why do the bars contain more carbohydrates than other Medifast Meals?
You can season your Medifast Meals and your Lean & Green Meal with most herbs, seasonings or spices. Experiment with different seasonings to find the flavors you enjoy. For general health purposes, we recommend limiting salt intake. For more specific seasoning usage information, refer to our complete list of (PDF file). Can I use any seasonings?
Condiment Options
Some condiments are a significant source of additional calories. Of course, we want you to enjoy your food - but we recommend condiment use in order to achieve the best weight loss results. For more specific condiment usage information, refer to our complete list of (PDF file). What are the limitations on the condiments I can use?
dolimiting Condiment Options
Special occasion meals are easier to handle than you may think! Simply rearrange your Medifast Meal routine (if necessary) so that you can enjoy your Lean & Green Meal at your breakfast meeting, family brunch, awards banquet or virtually any special occasion involving food!  You should have your typical Lean & Green serving of meat and vegetables as usual. Request that your meat be prepared/served without sauce if possible. If you can't avoid eating something that isn't part of the Lean & Green Meal, it may raise your daily calorie intake -- but you can get back on the 5 & 1 Plan starting with your next meal. It is still best not to skip meals, even when you think you may have over-eaten. Resume your plan as soon as you are able.  What if I want to eat out at a restaurant?
As an alternative, you can bring along a Medifast Meal and ask the waiter for hot or cold water (depending on what you are eating) to mix your meal. Then simply prepare your Medifast Meal and eat it with everyone else!
Yes, as long as it is sugar-free gum. You can also have sugar-free mints. Make sure to limit these to no more than 3 per day. This will count as your one (1) optional snack for the day. Can I chew gum?
You can use butter substitutes such as Molly McButter Butter Budsand I Can't Believe It's Not Butterspray as great alternatives to actual butter. For more specific condiment usage information, refer to our complete list of (PDF file). Can I have butter substitutes?
Condiment Options
Medifast offers delicious Cappuccino, Chai Latte and Hot Cocoa! These hot drinks can be used as part of your 5 & 1 Plan, and can also be enjoyed throughout Transition and Maintenance. Can I have lattes?
Coffee shop or other non-Medifast types of lattes are not recommended on the 5 & 1 Plan because theyre made with about 1/2 cup of milk -- and milk adds too many additional carbohydrates to your diet during the weight loss phase. Instead of a latte, try a regular cup of coffee with low fat/fat-free creamer, half & half or skim milk and sugar-free syrups or extracts for flavoring -- refer to our complete list of (PDF file). Once you transition to the Maintenance phase, you can include low fat dairy products. Condiment Options
Yes. You can have shirataki noodles -- serving size 1-1/2 cups (12 oz). This would be considered the Green portion of your Lean & Green Meal. Can I have shirataki noodles?
On the Program
The amount of weight you lose will fluctuate from week to week. Several situations may change the number on the scale, such as the time of day you weigh yourself, your menstrual cycle, not drinking enough water, whether or not you recently eliminated or how closely you are following your 5 & 1 Plan. Don't panic if the scale doesn't move for several days -- or even goes up slightly. If you stay on your program (and are consuming all of your meals), the scale will eventually show results. Try to weigh yourself only once a week, at the same time each week (the ideal time being immediately after you wake up). Why did the scale go up?
Plateaus can occur at different times for different people. They normally happen because your body is attempting to hold on to its fat stores. It's as though your body reshuffles its weight status while assessing whether it's ready to continue losing -- once it feels settled, your system will kick back in and allow your weight to drop again. If you experience a weight loss plateau, look for other indications of progress such as wearing a smaller size of clothing. Weight loss should resume if you continue to follow the program. You can contact the Nutrition Support Team at Medifast if you need assistance. For information on slower weight loss, please refer to our (PDF file). What can I do about a weight loss plateau?
