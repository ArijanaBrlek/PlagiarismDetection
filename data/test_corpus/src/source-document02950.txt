Interview Success
Congratulations. You have successfully gained an interview and are well on your way to love, happiness, fulfilment and your next step on the career ladder.
But lets not get too carried away; the toughest test is still to come, and preparation is the key to your success.
Whether you are a Director dusting off the interview cobwebs or this is your first interview as a professional, here are a handful of topics to help you be as well prepared as possible.
Research
Gather as much information as possible.
Youd think this was fairly obvious, but its surprising how few people actually bother to do it thoroughly. Search libraries, the web, trade journals, and company literature. If you cant answer a question that is readily available on their website, its not going to help your cause. Find out what they like and dislike, where theyre heading, whom they admire, how they like their coffee and where they go on holidays. (Actually dont do those last two  might scare them a bit.)
If youre having trouble finding all the info then try and speak to people who may have worked there. Failing that then call the company directly.
Interview Tips
Give a good handshake.
Be confident (but not overly so). Keep a good posture and use positive body language. Speak clearly. Maintain a good level of eye contact. And smile. But just remember, youre not a model from a toothpaste commercial, so try not to overdo it.
CV
Think of how your experience will benefit your potential employer.
Make sure you know your CV back-to-front, and if you absolutely have to refer to it, make sure youve got a clean copy handy, preferably one that isnt folded up into a small origami bird.
Listen
What exactly are they asking you?
If there is an obvious hidden question, make sure you are answering it! Take time to understand precisely what theyve said, and then make a concise, but brilliant response thatll take their breath away. Try not to waffle too much, but then again dont just give yes or no answers. If you have any visuals feel free to use them to help illustrate a point, but make sure theyre relevant. They dont want to see what your cat looks like.
Your Questions
Heres where you can show your genuine desire to get the job by showing the depth of your knowledge and interest.
Use your research to prepare questions that demonstrate your knowledge of the company.
This is a huge and usually the final opportunity to round off the interview. Depending on the type of role, you will be expected to close the interview.
A soft close may be by asking what are your thoughts on my suitability for the role? .
Whereas in a sales oriented role you may well be expected to ask for specific objections and overcome them.

Au Reviour
Or goodbye as we say in the UK. Always end the interview on a positive note and make sure you are sincere. Maybe its just us, but words like Ciao dont seem to leave them with a great impression. Unless youre in Italy.
