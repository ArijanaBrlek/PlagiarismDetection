So, do you need to run off and apply for medical school just because you scored high in the investigative section? Of course not. Quizzes like these are not designed to tell you exactly which job is right for you, but rather to get you thinking about your preferences. You should also look to see if you scored high in more than one section. There are many combinations and possibilities out there.
This is only one of many career assessment tools available through bookstores, the Web, and Oakland Community College. To truly get a full understanding of how to best plan the perfect career for you, make an appointment at a Career Planning Center at one of OCC's campuses. Call (248)341-2346.
