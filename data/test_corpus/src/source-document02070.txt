Established in 1997, the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership (DCGEP) is a public non-profit organization dedicated to using the power of video to provide information and support community development in under-resourced areas around the world.
Together with partners from the private and public sectors, DCGEP brings the highest quality educational programming and video technology into communities where people have little access to educational resources that enable them to explore their world and satisfy their curiosity. These tools, together with extensive teacher training, are making a proven, positive impact on student learning, teacher effectiveness, and community empowerment.
The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation and Chevron are major sponsors of the initiative. Together with Discovery they are helping DCGEP expand its reach around the world. By the end of 2009, more than 760,000 students in 286 schools in 16 countries in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe will have benefited from DCGEP's work, and over 12,500 teachers trained to use television effectively to support local education objectives. Golden Globe-nominated actor, Dennis Haysbert, serves as the global spokesperson for the organization.
