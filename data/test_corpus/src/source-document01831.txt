In and Hangul (Eonhaebon): hanja [1]
In Hangul (Eonhaebon): [1]
Translation:
Because the speech of the country is different from that of China, it [the spoken language] doesn't match the [Chinese] letters. Therefore, even if the ignorant want to communicate, many of them cannot achieve their intent. Because I am saddened by this, I have newly made 28 letters. It is my intention that everybody learn the letters easily so that they can conveniently use them everyday.
