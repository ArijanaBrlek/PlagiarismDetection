Unlike the senior citizens and disabled persons exemption program, deferred taxes are a lien on the property. This lien becomes payable, together with interest, upon sale, transfer or inheritance of the property.
Exemptions/b> Your family automobile, household goods, personal effects and home furnishings are not subject to property tax. However, personal property tax may be due if these items are used in a business.
