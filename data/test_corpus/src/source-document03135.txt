FAQ: My data aren't in XML. How can I convert the data to XML to be loaded into Starlight?
XML is increasingly becoming the format of choice for data transfer, and increasing numbers of applications support XML as either a native or export data format. First, check to see if the information system or applications software you are currently using to process your data supports XML as an export format.
For example, Oracle has supported XML export for some time now; Microsoft Access and Excel 2002 also now support XML output. Large quantities of data still reside in legacy databases that are "XML unaware," however. All is not lost. Output your data as ASCII text (if the data aren't in that format already) or in a comma delimited file (csv) , then use Starlight's XEE (XML Engineering Environment) to preprocess, re-engineer, and/or augment your data and convert them into a useful XML format.
Note that this process will typically involve an information extraction stage, to locate particular text components of interest and associate them with appropriate XML elements (for example Author, Title, and Date), as well as an XML structuring stage.
While the information extraction stage isn't strictly required (for example, a na ve conversion could be used that simply "wraps" the entire source text in a single XML root element). Starlight can derive a lot of information and relationships out of unstructured data but clearly the more structure that can be derived, the more valuable the information becomes for other visualizations within Starlight.
XEE incorporates functions for harvesting data from a variety of sources, transporting, sorting, cleaning, reformatting, and/or enhancing them, and outputting them to a target location. Typically, the output target will be a Starlight Server; however, XEE can also output data to alternative locations such as file directories. XEE enables non-programmers to quickly and easily create a variety of useful information processing solutions with a quick drag-and-drop interface.
For highly complex or mission-critical data, we recommend the development of a custom parser (e.g., a PERL script or dedicated software application) to ensure accurate conversion. XEE can include the Perl script as part of the process.
We can provide consulting or contract software development services in this regard.
