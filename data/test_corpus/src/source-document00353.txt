Other Job Issues
The Law
The New Jersey Law Against Discrimination prohibits unfair treatment because you are a woman (or because of your race, age, marital status, religion, nationality or national origin, color, physical or mental handicap, sexual preference, or veteran status). This means, for example, that you cannot be subjected to discrimination in housing, employment or use of public accommodations because you are a woman (or unmarried or a lesbian).    
Housing
Prohibitions against housing discrimination apply both to buying or renting a house. There is an exception for rental places with less than four rental units and for certain uniform limits (retirement communities limited by age or single-sex communities). A landlord is forbidden to refuse to rent to you because you are pregnant or have children less than 14 years of age. Advertisements may not unlawfully discriminate either.    
Public Accommodations
These include restaurants, stores, theaters, transportation and other places and services that are open to the public. There are also requirements aimed at improving access to these places by the physically handicapped.    
Employment
Much of the discrimination that women experience takes place in the workplace. Federal and state laws prevent an employer, with few exceptions, from considering that you are a woman in hiring, firing, or promoting you or in deciding how much you get paid.    
     Your employer may not follow employment policies or practices that serve no legitimate purpose and that harm women unfairly. This does not mean that the employers rules have to be fair in other respects or that it has to treat "all employees the same." Employment policies can be harsh, unnecessary, or even arbitrary if they have no unusual impact on women and other protected groups. An employer can also treat workers differently because of qualifications, job performance, and other legitimate business reasons  at least when this does not have an unfair and unreasonable group impact on those the law seeks to protect.
     Particular employee protections include the following:
Pregnancy discrimination: Since only women become pregnant, you cannot be forced to leave your job because you are pregnant if you can still do the work. You are also entitled, if you can still do the work, to the same sick pay or disability that any other employee would be paid for any other medical absence. (If your employer offers no sick leave or disability benefits, you may apply for state temporary disability payments.)
Family leave: Family leave is discussed later in this chapter.
Disability: A disability (physical or mental) that does not affect your job performance may not be used against you. Your employer must try to accommodate the disability reasonably before deciding that you cannot perform the job. The federal Law Against Discrimination (which applies to companies with 15 or more employees) and state law differ at some points in the kinds of handicap issues they address, thereby providing complementary protections.
AIDS: AIDS and some other contagious diseases are considered disabilities. They are also discussed in the chapter on Health Issues. Since AIDS is not transmitted by casual contact, it is rare that an employer could successfully prove that the job would jeopardize your health and safety or that of co-workers as if it were a more contagious disease.
Equal Pay: If your job requires comparable skill, effort, responsibility, and similar working conditions as a higher paying job, you must receive the same pay even though the job titles are different.
     In any type of discrimination, the employer is forbidden to retaliate against you for making a discrimination complaint to him/her or to state or federal authorities. Even when the original complaint turns out to be mistaken, an employers retaliation could be an independent basis for compensation and other relief for you. The employer may not fire, suspend, demote, or otherwise act against you for filing the complaint. Attempts by an employer to give other reasons, like poor job performance, are closely scrutinized by the authorities and the courts.
What to Do
Consider whether to complain "within the system," to the authorities, or both. When you are discriminated against, some employers may come to your assistance; discrimination hurts the company as well as you. Gather as much proof as you can to support your claim. Keep notes and other records of all relevant conversations. If you decide to complain within the company, consult your Employee Handbook on how to proceed.    
Consider hiring a lawyer. You do not need a lawyer to file a complaint with the EEOC or the state Division on Civil Rights. However, because of backlogs and proof difficulties, consider consulting an employment lawyer who does plaintiffs work. Many lawyers handle meritorious cases of this kind for a contingent fee, meaning you may not need to pay the lawyer anything (except for out-of-pocket expenses) unless you win. On the other hand, be reminded that there is no guarantee that you will regain any money you have invested or any job or benefits you have lost and that such cases sometimes take years to resolve.
If you belong to a labor union, contact your shop steward or business agent.
Mitigate damages. If you are fired or otherwise out of work because of discrimination, seek other comparable employment and keep a careful record showing that you did so; you often have a duty to try to lessen the financial injury in this way. Since such cases may take years to move through the court system, you should not delay other employment pending the resolution of your case. You do not need to accept other employment in order to recover damages unless it provides comparable work and compensation.
Document your work. To rebut the claim that you were fired, demoted, or denied a promotion because of poor work performance, keep copies of memos and evaluations that attest to the quality of your work. If you are given an evaluation that you disagree with, ask to have your response included in your record.
Act in a timely manner.
Resources
To deal with discrimination issues, contact your companys human resources office or other person designated to deal with discrimination issues, or an employment lawyer, or:    
New Jersey Division on Civil Rights in Trenton (609)292-4605 or Newark (201)648-2700 This agency receives and investigates your complaint and can prosecute the wrongdoers civilly to correct the wrong or compensate you for your loss. The Division will investigate, try to resolve or prosecute your complaint without charge, though it is presently trying to work its way out from under a huge backlog of cases.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (201)645-6383. In employment matters, this is the federal counterpart to New Jerseys Division on Civil Rights.

The Law
Sexual harassment is prohibited under both federal Title VII and the state Law Against Discrimination. Sexual harassment is "any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of sexual nature" such as when sex is made a condition of employment; when the response to sexual proposals becomes a basis for raises, promotions, or working conditions; and whenever the conduct unreasonably interferes with your ability to do your job or creates an "intimidating, hostile, or offensive" work atmosphere for you, as judged by the standards of a reasonable woman.    
     Your employer has a legal duty to prevent such harassment. In New Jersey, your employer is responsible for harassment caused by supervisors regardless of whether company officials know about the incident or have a stated policy against it.
     Your employer can also be held responsible for harassment by non-supervisors, co-workers, or non-employees at your place of work if you have reported the incident and your company failed to take action to protect you.
     Consent to acts of flirting, joking, or requests for a date between co-workers infers that the act is not "unwelcome" and not sexual harassment.
What to Do
The advice given about other gender discrimination applies to sexual harassment as well. You should also do the following:    
Say NO to the offender quickly and directly. Make it clear that the behavior or remark is not acceptable. In some cases, this is all that is needed to stop the harassment.
Talk to co-workers about the incident. Sexual harassers are often "repeat offenders." Employers are more likely to respond if complaints come from more than one person.
Tell friends and family about the incident immediately. If needed, they can testify to your reaction and lend credibility to your case.
Note who saw the incident and your reaction.
Complain to your employer through a supervisor, personnel officer, management, or union official. Keep copies of all communications, write memos on conversations, and keep these with your other personal records.
