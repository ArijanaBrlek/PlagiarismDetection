NIU alumna was Pulitzer finalist for hurricane coverage
Christy Arnold, a 1999 NIU and Northern Star alumna, was part of a team that became a finalist for this years Pulitzer Prize for local reporting of breaking news. Arnold was a reporter for the Sun Herald in Port Charlotte, Fla. The nomination was for the papers coverage of Hurricane Charley, which devastated the community last August.
Pulitzer judges cited the Sun Heralds heroic coverage of Hurricane Charley after it destroyed the homes of employees and cut the papers power supply and phone service.
The Sun Herald did not ultimately win the Pulitzer. That went to The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J., for its comprehensive, clear-headed coverage of the resignation of New Jerseys governor after he announced he was gay and confessed to adultery with a male lover.
This summer, Arnold has accepted a reporting position with the Cincinnati Enquirer..
Study shows newsroom diversity slipping
Newsrooms at daily papers are moving the wrong way when it comes to their racial and ethnic makeup reflecting their communities, says a report released June 1 by the Knight Foundation.
Among the 200 largest newspapers, 73 percent employ fewer minorities, as a share of the newsroom jobs, than they did in some earlier year from 1990 to 2004, the report stated. Only 27 percent of these large dailies were at their peak as 2005 began.
The Gannett and Knight Ridder newspaper groups ranked first and second, respectively, in what the study termed its diversity index. With a score of 100 equalling parity with the circulation area, Gannett papers scored a combined 89. Knight Ridder scored 76.
