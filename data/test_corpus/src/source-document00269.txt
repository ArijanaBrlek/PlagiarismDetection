Fitness Centers for Women
It is one of the hottest fads in fitness - fitness centers for women. Curves markets its exercise option to women. And, women are responding by signing up and trying out the workout. But does it work?
Let examine the gym. A lot of women dislike the gym. More to the point, we dislike showing our bodies at the gym.
We would like to wear some comfortable workout wear but with men at the gym we opt instead for an big shirt and baggy pants.
Many women who feel self conscious about their bodies don go to gyms if they can help it. Where else can they go to work out?
Now there is Curves for Women
Curves is an exercise facility totally for women. You can come in your comfortable exercise clothes that may hug the curves and feel just fine in the company of others who also want to feel comfortable.
Curves tells women that if they have 30 minutes, they can get into shape. Their workout revolves around the idea of circuit training. With circuit training, a person moves from one piece of equipment to the next with only 30-60 seconds between sets.
The circuit training at Curves alternates cardio exercises with strength training to burn fat and build muscle. And, the program can be completed in 30 minutes. If you have an hour for lunch or time before or after work, you can go into a Curves center and get your workout in for the day.
Who can join Curves?
Any woman can join the Curves gym. At Curves, membership at one site means that you can visit any site and work out. If you are vacationing and want to continue your workouts, find a Curves gym and spend 30 minutes getting fit.
Why do women keep going? Convenience is a factor. With a circuit training program, the participants keep moving. When it time to change, everyone moves to the next piece of equipment. There is support from the Curves staff.
Each machine uses what they call the CurvesSmart system. It is a fitness coaching program that adjusts to your level of fitness while continually making changes to challenge you. Members get the opportunity to learn about diet and nutrition and how it plays a part in your health. Added to that, members can connect online to find support for their exercise and healthy eating plan.
Curves is still working for many women. As the Curves program has evolved, the changes have helped to keep the experience fresh and new for members.
