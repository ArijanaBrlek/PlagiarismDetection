ADIRONDACK BRONZE SINGLE TWIGWARE
TWIGS AND STICKS OF BRONZE
GORGEOUS BRONZE TWIG FLATWARE HAS A WARM BROWN PATINA FINISH ON THE HANDLES WHICH LOOKS LIKE REAL STICKS AND TWIGS. THE MANUFACTURER (VANCE KITIRA) RECOMMENDS WASHING THE FLATWARE BY HAND. WASHING THE TWIGWARE BY HAND HELPS KEEP THE SHINY GOLD BRONZE EATING PART OF THE FLATWARE SHINY. KNOWING THE IMPRACTICALITY OF THIS FOR MOST BUSY PEOPLE, I TESTED DISHWASHING THE TWIGWARE. FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS I USED OF THIS FLATWARE ALMOST DAILY AND WASHED IT IN THE DISHWASHER (SOFTWATER & CASCADE SOAP). THE SHINY EATING PART TURNS A NICE BROWNISH DULLER PATINA REMINISCENT OF ANTIQUE BRONZE OR BRASS. THE HANDLES LOSE MUCH OF THE BROWN. PLEASE NOTE THE PHOTOS BELOW. WE HAVE NOT TESTED DISHWASHING THE TWIGWARE IN ACIDIC, VERY HARD OR CORROSIVE TYPE WATER (WHICH MAY BE PRESENT IN SOME PARTS OF THE U.S.A.) OR HAVE NOT WASHED IT IN CORROSIVE DETERGENTS WHICH MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE BRONZE. THE BRONZE CONTAINS COPPER AND NICKEL. 5-PIECE SET-INCLUDES A DINNER FORK, A DESSERT / SALAD FORK, A TEASPOON, A SOUP SPOON AND A KNIFE 2-PIECE SERVING SET HAS A LARGE FORK AND A LARGE SPOON EACH SINGLE TWIG SET COMES WITH A VERY USEFUL UNBLEACHED COTTON MUSLIN NAPKIN EACH DOUBLE TWIG SET COMES WITH A WOVEN POCKET COVER

The used twigware has tarnished after many years of being washed in a dishwasher and has lost the darker bronze handle color. The eating part has dulled and lost the shininess it once had. This set is sold "AS IS" and needs some "elbow grease" to shine them up. We suggest having a buffing machine to shine the eating parts. The handles can be darkened as noted below by soaking them with the JAX darkening solution. They will probably not look new again but can be enjoyed for their rustic charm at a very discounted price. Sorry only one 15 set group offered and the group cannot be broken apart. Thank you.
