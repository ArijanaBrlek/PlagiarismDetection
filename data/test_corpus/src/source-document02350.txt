Cholesterol Reduction :: A Doctor's Guide
Cholesterol Basics
Cholesterol Watch: The Clock is Ticking
Cholesterol is a fat- like substance (lipid) present in the cell membrane. Our body needs cholesterol to build cell membranes, making hormones, to digest our dietary fat intake and various other very important bodily functions. But there is a dark side to this seemingly helpful substance which affects the lives of millions of people all over the world.
Cholesterol & Atherosclerosis
Cholesterol travels in the blood in distinct particles containing both lipids and proteins (lipoproteins). When excessive amounts of cholesterol are circulated, they cause damage to the arteries, especially the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. Cholesterol ridden plaque accumulates in vessel linings leading to a condition called "atherosclerosis".
High Cholesterol & Heart Disease
High cholesterol levels impedes blood flow to the heart and the heart muscle becomes starved for oxygen causing chest pains (angina). If a blood clot obstructs a coronary artery affected by atherosclerosis, a heart attack (myocardial infarction) is likely to occur often proving to be fatal. Reducing cholesterol levels has become the need of the hour.
Heart disease, because of high cholesterol levels, is the major killer in America - far more than road accidents, plane crashes, hurricanes, gang wars combined together. More than 90 million American adults or 50 percent of the adult population has high blood cholesterol levels, the primary risk factor for heart disease.
High Cholesterol & Diet
Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products make up our dietary cholesterol intake. Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in cholesterol content. Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. After a meal, cholesterol is absorbed by the intestines into the blood circulation and is then packaged inside a protein coat. This cholesterol-protein coat complex is called a chylomicron.
The liver is capable of removing cholesterol from the blood circulation as well as manufacturing cholesterol and secreting cholesterol into the blood circulation. After a meal, the liver removes chylomicrons from the blood circulation. In between meals, the liver manufactures and secretes cholesterol back into the blood circulation.
