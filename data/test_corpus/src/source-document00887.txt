The Fall of GM: I'm not sure the blaming of labor is quite accurate - if anything they're easy scapegoats for a board and shareholders who did EVERYTHING wrong for years - but otherwise this is an interesting summation of their current troubles.

Five lessons learned by University of Iowa undergrads in Kembrew McLeods 2008 Popular Music & Culture class, in which they had to answer the following throwaway final exam question: In a couple sentences, explain why -- although it is important to reserve the right to rock -- one should never rock it hardcore twenty-four hours a day.
5. It is important to reserve the right to rock because everyone needs an outlet for rebellion, but rocking 24-7 is not a sustainable lifestyle.
4. One should never rock it hardcore 24 hours a day because it would no longer be hardcore; it would just be like any other day.
3. If one were to rock all night and all day, then there would be nothing else in life that would be non-rock. Therefore, if the category non-rock couldnt exist, neither could rock.
2. One should never rock it hardcore 24 hours a day because eventually it would become lame and tedious. In order to reserve the awesomeness of rocking, one must take time to do other things so that it remains totally sweet to rock.
1. Although to rock it hardcore 24 hours a day sounds nice, in order to truly reserve the right to rock one must discontinue rocking at some point. In order to keep the rocking hardcore, the length of time must be under 24 hours. [The student then drew a graph titled Trajectory of Rock: Time vs. Intensity, with an x axis representing intensity and the y axis time. The recommended ideal balance of hardcore, extended rocking totals 2-4 hours a day.] Â

This is a graphic of the Standard and Poor's stock index's annual returns, placing every year since 1825 in a column of returns from -50% to +60%. As you can see, it is a rough bell curve, with 45 of those 185 years falling in the +0-10% column. There are only 5 years each in the 40-50% and 50-60% return columns, and, through 2007, there were only one year each in the -31-40% and -41-50% columns. You can see where 2008 to date falls.
Urban Green Belts in the Twenty-first Century (Urban Planning and Environment)
As the jacket says, "maintaining and enhancing living conditions in cities ... is a newly emerging focus of governments around the world." But how dedicated are planning agencies to long-term solutions, and are they strong enough to fight the many developers and other interests who see integrated green space and other non-commercialization of otherwise salable property as a waste?
Marco Amati, professor of urban planning at Australia's Macquarie University, presents 11 case studies on the successes of using so-called "green belts" - in residential and mixed-zone neighborhoods and as barriers between types of zoning - and, between these cases, discusses the conflicts that have attended the planning and building processes in these communities.
The first chapter lays the conflict out explicitly: "the coalition of the unwilling: landowners and the green belt" looks at the abandonment, in the 1950s, of Tokyo's vaunted, long-planned and partially constructed green belt in one case study, and the "reform" - what some would call the capitulation to commercial interests and incredible growth - of a similar project in Seoul. Chapter 2, which addresses how the use of green belts has "fallen out of fashion" in some municipalities, addresses attempts to protect the "green wedges" of Melbourne, as well as the lip service that was paid to green belt planning in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. Other case studies in later chapters deal with attempts - some successful and others not nearly - in other cities around the world, including Ottawa, Seattle, Vienna, Berlin, Paris and various locations within Italy.
The book itself is well-illustrated, with maps and tables of contemporary and historic data throughout, and while most readers won't need to be persuaded of the importance of green zones in urban planning, the editor does work hard to make this consistent argument tie together the disparate cases. is both a valuable resource, giving plenty of ammunition to planners and activists trying to integrate a consistent plan for green space in their own communities, and an excellent primer on the contemporary and historic uses and misuses of such spaces, and how solutions aren't always best described by their inclusion in or exclusion from a strictly-defined "success / failure" model.
