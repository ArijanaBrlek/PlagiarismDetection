I didn't buy this mouse for games. It's only for everyday use.
At first, I couldn't get use to the two huge buttons, they felt kind of awkward. Slowly I get use to them and they feel just like the regular buttons (not better, not worst).
I like all those accessory buttons, for you can program them to everything you like. The mouse movement is smooth as advertised and definitely worth the money.

Pros Everything you want for a good keyboard: comfortable, functional and features-riched.
Cons Function Keys mess up by default (F-Lock can't set to default)
The Bottom Line Excellent keyboard for "Email and Word Processor" users. F-Lock key feature is extremely annoying. If you use function keys, avoid this and any keyboards with F-LOCK.
Full Review What's Good?
1, It has an excellent sets of 9 accessories keys. They are labeled as webcams, emails, shopping, home page... etc They are useless by default (who needs a "shopping" button?) but can be easily programmed to user assigned programs like word, excel, or whatever.
2, It has a "deluxe feeling" for the keys, not too hard, not too soft, just right, feels much better than cheapy keyboards.
3, It has an excellent volume dial to control the volume of the computer (That's a major feature I'm looking for).
4, The iTouch software (version 2.15) seems to be functional and convenient (...
