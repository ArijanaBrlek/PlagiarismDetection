PVC and the Environment
The environmental compatibility of PVC has been intensively investigated over the past 30 years. At the same time, all the production processes - from the starter products to PVC - have been ecologically optimised. Thanks to a large number of individual measures, resource input has been minimised and the emissions have been drastically reduced. With today's concentrations in our products and in the ambient air all below threshold levels, vinyl chloride is no longer a health hazard. The commission of inquiry set up by the German Bundestag under the designation "Protection of Man and the Environment" established in 1994 that PVC is "one of the most thoroughly investigated materials". At the same time, the commission warns against substituting alternative materials for PVC without considering ecological balances. In important fields of application for PVC, such ecological balances are now available. They show that PVC compares consistently well with other materials. The low consumption of petroleum and energy is of particular advantage here (PVC comprises 57% chlorine, which is produced from common salt, and this is available in practically unlimited quantities). The fact that PVC articles are extremely durable and require little maintenance is also of ecological advantage. An added advantage of PVC is that it is highly suitable for recycling. Plants for recycling window frames, piping, flooring and roof sheeting have been operating in Germany for years. PVC's good price/performance ratio means that unnecessary additional costs are avoided. All in all, PVC may be considered a material with ecological and economic advantages. Vinnolit is a member of the working group "PVC und Umwelt e.V." (PVC and the Environment) in Bonn, and of PlasticsEurope, Germany (Association of German Plastics Manufacturers, formerly VKE) in Frankfurt. Vinnolit is also a member of PlasticsEurope, Brussels (Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe, formerly APME) and of the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers, which co-ordinate and address environmentally relevant questions on a European level. Vinnolit fully supports the Voluntary Commitment of the European PVC industry for sustainable development. When Vinnolit was founded, an environmental department was set up which is reporting to the managing board. It compiles information on ecological questions concerning PVC and chlorine chemistry. This also involves co-operation in scientific committees in Germany and abroad. The authorities and politicians, the media, the plastics-processing industry and the public are kept informed by way of lectures and presentations, publications and consultations. The environmental and the technical support departments also assist customers in the choice of environmentally compatible formulations (e.g., of stabilisers).
