They're Corkers!
Natural cork, right from those strange trees, in perfect discs and rings. We're thinking pads, gaskets, bumpers, arts and crafts projects, insulators, or all-natural, metal-detector-safe jewelry. You pick from 1" dia discs 3/8" thick, or 2" dia discs 1/4" or 3/8" thick; or from 2" OD x 1" ID rings that are 1/4" or 3/8" thick; or 3" OD x 2" ID rings that are 1/4" or 3/8" thick. Note that the Thins (below) are 1/4" thick, and the Thicks (below) are 3/8" thick. Got that?
