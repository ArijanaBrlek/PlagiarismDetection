The composition of this cabinet or group of administrators resulted in a variety of problems and helped to undermine the Karzai interim as well as transitional regime in many circles. Critics contended that neither Bonn nor the chosen government was very representative of the traditional power centers in Afghanistan. In particular, relatively few Pashtuns were given administrative/cabinet positions. Pashtuns expected this imbalance to be corrected in the Emergency (which was to select the Transitional Administration) with Karzai shifting the balance of power back to Pashtuns and giving the former king a prominent national role. The Bonn Agreement called on a Transitional Authority, including a broad-based transitional administration, “to lead Afghanistan until such time as a fully representative government can be elected,”[] no later than two years from the convening of the Emergency . The Emergency was also to elect a Head of State for the transitional administration.Loya Jirga 15 Loya JirgaLoya Jirga
In addition to the selection of Harmid Karzai as Transitional President (a surprise to no one), the main issues concerning government composition of the Emergency (of June 2002) turned out to be the role of the former king—Zahir Shah—and his representatives as well as the role of the Panjshiris. Once the former king gave his support for the election of fellow Pashtun Karzai as the Afghan head of state, ethnic issues were temporally diffused as subjects such as religion, the role of parliament, stability, and economic development dominated the debates. This diffusion of ethnic suspicions and rivalry, however, proved short-lived.Loya Jirgajirga
As suggested by , Karzai increased Pashtun representation in his new Transition Administration. Pashtun membership increased from the 11 members in the Interim Administration to 16 members while the remaining ethnic groups stayed fairly constant relative to their total representation in the Transition Administration.[] This increase in Pashtun representation was most certainly an attempt by Karzai to shore up support with his Pashtun brethren as well as to respond to earlier criticisms from people such as Lakhdar Brahimi, the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary General, who suggested that the Emergency should be used to correct the imbalances of the cabinet resulting from Bonn to more closely reflect the Afghan demographics. Nonetheless, many of the most important and powerful ministries stayed in the hands of the Tajiks () who were still in control of the security apparatus dominating Kabul. Table 1 16 Loya JirgaShura-e Nezar
The most problematic and sensitive appointments made by Karzai after his selection as Transition President were in the area of security. As suggested in , Karzai renamed Mohammed Fahim, leader of the Northern Alliance forces based in the Panjshir Valley, as defense minister. He also appointed Fahim as one of three vice-presidents, strengthening Fahim’s position in the Transition Government.[] This move was a clear indication of the power of the Tajiks as well as the Northern Alliance and signaled Karzai's acceptance of the Panjshiris as necessary partners in his militarily weak government. Karzai apparently recognized that he could not keep stability without the help of powerful factional leaders such as Fahim. Table 1 17
For all practical purposes there was only one change in the cabinet resulting from the Emergency the departure of interior minister Yunus Qanooni. Qanooni, a senior figure, who represented Northern Alliance interests at Bonn, played a key role at Bonn in initially securing support for Karzai's candidacy among leaders of the powerful, Tajik-led political and military coalition. But in the months leading up to the Emergency the relationship between Karzai and Qanooni became contentious reflecting much of the traditional distrust between Afghan Pashtuns and Tajiks.keyLoya Jirga—Jamiat-e IslamiLoya Jirga
Karzai’s dismissal of Qanooni was met with considerable controversy. After the announcement of the appointment of Taj Mohammed Wardak, an elderly governor and ethnic Pushtun, as the new Interior minister, Panjshiri soldiers and policemen in the ministry initially resisted the change with roadblocks and work stoppages. Karzai, recognizing the implications of alienating the Tajiks as well as the reality of the considerable military strength of the Northern Alliance and especially the Panjshiris, eventually resolved the “crisis” by appointing Qanooni as adviser for internal security, a newly created post, as well as minister of education.[] 18
At the time of the Emergency , Fahim, Qanooni, and Ahmad Zia Massoud[] were all vying for the leadership of the Panjshiris (), and relations among them became reportedly strained. The demands by Pashtuns that Panjshiri power should be reduced exacerbated relations in particular between Fahim and Qanooni. Indeed Qanooni eventually organized the Afghan opposition party and anti-Karzai alliance— (New Afghanistan Party), while Massoud (in association with Fahim) formed (Afghanistan National Movement Party). Karzai seemed to be caught in the middle of this politicking amongst the Panjshiri clique.Loya Jirga 19 Shura-e NezarHizb-e Afghanistan-e NawinHezb-e Nohzat-e Melli-ye Afghanistan
Assessment of the Loya Jirgas to Post-Conflict Stability: Afghanistan’s Ethnic Dimension
Questions of ethnicity are critical in assessing the implications of the to future Afghan political and social stability. Past attempts at modern state formation in Afghanistan that have directly challenged the local tribal and religious structures of society have resulted in ethnic backlash and state failure. Most recently, it has been argued by some that political factions from the former parties, especially the Tajik faction manipulated the process as well as the Transitional Administration and that “President Hamid Karzai failed to grasp the opportunity to establish new constituencies and develop support for the peace-building process. Instead, Afghans have been frustrated by opaque procedures that increase the power of the factions in control of the central government and undermine attempts to create a new public culture of accountability.”[]loya jirgasmujahideenShura-e Nezarloya jirga 20
Afghanistan is a country with a diverse ethnic composition that complicates democratic, as well as, state formation. The present boundaries of Afghanistan were created to serve as a buffer between British and Russian Empires as Afghanistan confronted modernity through its forced integration into a Eurocentric state.[] These “virtual” borders were not drawn along ethnic, linguistic, or religious lines and created an externally imposed “state” comprised of a complicated mix of people mostly living in small, kin-based communities outside of the limited urban areas. The underlying issue for Afghanistan’s governments has been their inability to create a sense of genuine national unity in times other than during crisis.[] The lack of nationalism compared to the deep-rooted ethnic identity of the majority of Afghans reflects the realties confronting ethnically fragmented societies attempting to coalesce into one unified front. 21 22
Today, Afghanistan is made up primarily of: Pashtuns who would like to see a strong and Pashtun-run central state; Tajiks who focus on power sharing in the central state; and Uzbeks and Hazaras who desire recognition of their identities and mechanisms of local government.[] Although some of these groups are ethnically and linguistically distinct, they are not necessarily different in terms of culture. 23
Historically, Afghanistan[] has been ruled and governed by the Pashtun tribes of the south as they form the largest demographic bloc within Afghanistan. Unlike other ethnic groups, the Pashtuns stress pronounced tribal structures and codes at expense of the state. The Pashtun dominance of government has created an atmosphere of tension between them and the remaining ethnic groups in Afghanistan, mainly Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras. These tensions have lead to conflict as well as the introduction of repressive measures to quell the power struggle of these ethnic minority groups. 24
These remaining ethnic groups have played certain specific roles within the society as a whole as well as within the government. However, not until the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan did these other ethnic groups truly gain power within the overall societal structure and establish themselves as a political and military force that the Pashtuns could no longer ignore. In the past, fighting for control of the state had occurred primarily between Pashtuns (i.e., Durranis vs. Ghilzais), but as these other ethnic groups rose in importance and made stabs at governing, there became a great struggle within Afghanistan that eventually led to outright civil war and the collapse of the Afghan Government and state structure.
Since the beginning of modern Afghanistan, Afghan rulers have attempted to manipulate ethnic groups in their attempts to control the state. For example, “to weaken the Barakzais, Ahmed Shah, the 'father' of modern Afghanistan appointed a separate khan for the Achakzais, making the clan into a separate tribe, a status that they retain today.”[] Successful Afghan ruling authorities have been artful in underscoring and exploiting the differences of these groups to include the encouragement of conflict between them in order to maintain control. 25
Further complicating the dynamics of Afghan society are the relationships between the tribes themselves and between the varying ethnic groups that compose the nation-state. Simply put, the relationships between tribes are generally marked by “competition and outright animosity.”[] The failure of many past Afghan regimes has been their inability to bridge the gap between these competing groups and their willingness to play different groups against each other in order to consolidate their power.[] 26 27
Karzai's choice of cabinet members for the Transition Government represented a compromise between stability and change. Many Pashtuns expected that he would make major changes to the cabinet chosen during the Bonn Meeting by removing factional leaders and appointing a balanced and professional cabinet more in line with the desires of the Pashtun community. Ultimately, this proved to be an impossible task because the leaders of the Northern Alliance were less than accommodating to change that would diffuse the considerable power they received from the Bonn Meeting. The Transition Cabinet reflected Karzai's recognition of the importance of striking a balance between the Pashtuns and Tajiks. Karzai had become intimately aware after leading Afghanistan's interim government for the previous six months of the uneasy partnership with leaders from the Tajik-led Northern Alliance. He also recognized the extremely difficult task of assembling an administration that would satisfy all major ethnic groups while meeting the country's desperate need for professional governance after years of ruinous conflict.
While the Emergency achieved legitimacy for Hamid Karzai's transitional government—an end-state consistent with the desires of the United States and other international actors, the composition of this cabinet like the original interim administration was met with controversy, especially amongst the Pashtuns. The continued power of the Tajiks reflected by the ministerial portfolios they held did not sit well the Pashtuns (especially from the south and east). The prominent role of Tajiks in the Karzai Government perpetuated the alienation of much of Karzai's critical Pashtun power base. While former King Zahir Shah was named by Karzai as “Father of the Nation,” many Pashtuns were dismayed and angered that none of the King’s aides had been given senior posts.[] It was viewed by these critical Pashtuns that other than Karzai very few Pashtuns held positions of power in the Afghan cabinet. In July 2002, a article titled “Pashtuns Losing Faith in Karzai” posited that the Pashtuns were “becoming rapidly disillusioned by a series of developments that have reinforced the power of rival ethnic Tajiks and militia leaders, left the former king politically sidelined and a Pashtun vice president assassinated, and subjected Pashtun villages to lethal U.S. air attacks.”[]Loya Jirga 28 Washington Post 29
While the ethnic tensions would eventually be played out in the Afghan national elections of 2004 and 2005 (see below), the frustrations of many Pashtuns concerning Karzai was becoming explicitly evident. Padsha Khan Zadran, a powerful Pashtun warlord who reportedly controlled the three southeastern provinces of Khost, Paktia, and Paktika in Spring/Summer 2002 summed up the sentiments of many Pashtuns when he asked, “Why are they humiliating Pashtuns? We're the majority. They placed Hamid Karzai at the top as a representative of Pashtuns. But in reality he's no longer a Pashtun. He's sold himself out. He's a traitor. Pashtuns cannot sit around waiting. They will react and will claim their rights.”[] 30
Afghan Constitution
In addition to the two discussed above that selected the Afghan interim and transitional administrations, the Bonn Agreement also called for a Constitutional (CLJ) to adopt a new Afghan constitution within 18 months of the establishment of the Transitional Authority. The product of this process must be considered as a critical foundation for the nation-building process as well as long-term Afghan democratic stability. Special Representative of the Secretary General for Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi acknowledged at a January 31, 2003 open meeting of the UN Security Council that the “drafting and ratification of the new constitution…will also be a fundamental state building exercise.” He also stressed the need to “broaden the political base supporting the peace process” because “too many Afghans feel excluded from the government and political transformation which Afghanistan is undergoing.”[]loya jirgasLoya Jirgaloya jirga 31
The constitution was developed through three constitution-making organs—the Drafting Commission, the Constitutional Review Commission and the Constitutional with the assistance of the United Nations (especially United Nations Assistance Mission, UNAMA, and UNDP).[] During October 2002 Karzai created a nine-member Constitutional Drafting Commission that had the responsibility of producing a preliminary draft of the constitution. As would be experienced throughout the constitutional process, the Transitional Administration failed to establish this commission within the time period established by the Bonn Agreement. While Bonn called for the commission to be established “within two months”[] of the Transitional Administration’s inception by August 2002, it was not created until October 5, 2002—four months after the Emergency of June 2002 that established the Transitional Administration. Moreover, it was not until November 7, 2002 that former King Zahir Shah inaugurated this drafting commission. Hence, of the eighteen months originally envisaged in the Bonn Agreement for a constitution-making exercise, only thirteen remained when this commission began work.[] This was problematic because even the full eighteen months is a limited amount of time to educate the Afghan people, largely illiterate, and query them on subjects as complicated and foreign as many of those contained in the constitution.Loya Jirga 32 33 Loya Jirga 34
In April 2003 the draft constitution was presented to the Constitutional Review Commission, a 35 member commission, appointed by the president. As was the case with the drafting commission, this review body was “marked by considerable delay and involved primarily factional bargaining at the cabinet level without significant consideration of the public interest.”[] This commission was mandated to “consult widely” with the people of Afghanistan and produce a draft constitution by August 30, 2003 for submission to the Constitutional in October 2003. The delays in its formation, originally planned for February 2003 according to UNAMA officials, compromised “the possibility of real public debate, or even public education, about constitutional issues.”[] Moreover, as argued by the International Crisis Group (ICG), the actual members of the group were “dominated” by , and were: 35 Loya Jirga 36 Shura-e Nezar
“never likely to yield individuals who could be viewed as legitimate national figures capable of transcending narrow, sectarian interests. Indeed, the eventual list of 35 [members of the commission] reflects in particular the interests of and other groups, including Abd al-Rab al-Rasul Sayyaf’s , a group with Salafist inclinations and financial links to Saudi Arabia. One appointee is known for his attempts to suppress civil society independent of his party in Kabul. Because several experienced politicians from groups have been included but respected moderate leaders and members of democratic groups are conspicuously absent, it is likely that the commission will be dominated by the former.”[]Shura-e NezarjihadiIttehad-e Islami AfghanistanShura-e Nezarjihadi 37
The draft constitution was eventually handed off to the 502-person Constitutional (selected in UN-run caucuses) which actually deliberated on the constitution from December 13, 2003 to January 4, 2004. This representative body, which by a presidential decree could have no participation of either militia commanders or governmental officials, was tasked to confer legitimacy on the constitution through its review and adoption. Guidelines for this suggested that:Loya Jirgajirga
“In line with traditions of , the CLJ will be a grand representative meeting made up of all sectors of Afghan society and will deliberate upon and adopt the new constitution. To ensure their active participation in the deliberations, delegates will participate in a weeklong orientation to inform them about the contents of the Draft Constitution and rules of procedures of the CLJ. The CLJ will provide a further opportunity to build consensus on vital national issues and on controversies which might arise during the public consultations after the publication of the Draft Constitution.”[]Loya Jirgas 38
The constitution[] that was eventually adopted established a strong presidential system with the President serving as both Head of State as well as Head of Government. The President who must be elected by a majority of the popular vote (or win a runoff election between the two top candidates if no candidate received 50 percent of the popular vote in an initial presidential election) was eligible to serve two five-year terms.[] A proposal sponsored by the Northern Alliance to establish a prime minister as a check on the presidency, was not included in the original draft seemingly because of Karzai supporters' concerns that a prime minister might emerge as a rival to the presidency. 39 40
The constitution established a bicameral legislature and a Supreme Court with High Courts and Appeals Courts, but separate religious courts. The entire question of the Afghan judicial system is a matter of concern since many powerful Islamists presently are in or have influence in the emerging Afghan judiciary.no
The legislative body of the (Lower House or House of People) was established to promulgate laws, ratify treaties, and approve budgets. It also established that the was to consist of 249 seats with members to be elected (concurrently, if possible, with the presidential election) by districts to 5-year terms. The (Upper House or House of Elders) was to consist of a mixture of appointed and elected members (one-third of the seats were to be appointed by the president, one-third were to be selected by provincial councils, and one third were to be selected by district councils). This legislative body was given the authority to approve proposed laws and the budget. The constitution also gave the legislature the ability to impeach the president.Wolesi JirgaWolesi JirgaMeshrano Jirga
The constitution established 34 provinces with each being governed by a provincial council whose members were to be popularly elected to four-year terms. Before this realignment Afghanistan had consisted of 32 provinces. Two new provinces—Panjshir and Diakondi—were added to the political map of Afghanistan.
Map drawing in Afghanistan has always been a contentious issue and has ultimately related to issues of power alignment between Kabul and the hinterlands. For example, after the captured Kabul and established their Tajik-dominated short-lived government, the number of districts in a number of northern provinces—especially in Badakhshan, the home province of then-President Burhanuddin Rabbani—was increased. The addition of Panjshir (Tajik dominated), established April 13, 2004 from Parvan Province, and Diakondi (Hazara dominated) from the northern section of Oruzgan Province, established March 28, 2004, were proposed by Karzai to further reflect his desire to have a multi-ethnic local government representation and attempt to right the long-held perceptions by minority ethnic groups’ perceived administrative injustices against the non-Pashtun regions.mujahideen
Article 22 of the constitution affirmed women's equality under Afghan law. In stark contrast to the years of Taliban rule during which Afghan women were subjected to well-documented, draconian social rules and abuses, the adopted Afghan constitution also gave particular emphasis to the role of women in the legislature. The constitution explicitly stipulated that for the of those appointed by the president, 50 percent were to be women, meaning that one-sixth of upper house members were to be women. In the elected lower house at least 68 of those elected (two per each of the 34 provinces) by the constitution “should” be women.[] That gave women about 25 percent of the seats in the .Meshrano Jirga 41 Wolesi Jirga
Relative to political parties—institutions vital for a thriving democracy—the constitution was vague. The document allowed for political parties to be established so long as their charters “do not contradict the principles of Islam,” and do not have affiliations with foreign countries. The Political Parties Law that was later enacted by the Karzai Government provided the procedures for the legal registration of political parties in accordance with the constitution. This law prohibits political parties whose charters are “opposed to the principles of the holy religion Islam,” which is problematic since Islamic principles are open to interpretation. Furthermore, this dynamic affords influential Islamist groups an instrument to block parties they deem politically unacceptable.[] 42
While the constitution and the actual process employed for its ratification and adoption must be seen as positive steps for Afghanistan’s future the actual document and process surrounding it were not without flaws and have the potential to inhibit future stability.
Afghan Elections
According to the Bonn Accords, the Transition Authority was “to lead Afghanistan until such a time as a fully representative government can be elected through free and fair elections to be held no longer than two years from the date of the convening of the .”[] Elections for the Afghan Presidency, National Assembly, and Provincial Councils were all to be held concurrently in the spring of 2004. That timetable for the elections was repeatedly changed. A series of events including electoral infrastructure delays, accelerating instability, and the apparent reemergence of the Taliban eventually led to the postponement and separation of the elections for Afghanistan's President, National Assembly, and Provincial Councils. The presidential elections were rescheduled from June 2004 to September 2004, then to October 2004. Finally, a decision was taken to hold only presidential while the National Assembly and Provincial Council elections were eventually schedule for September 2005.Emergency Loya Jirga 43
On May 25, 2004, Karzai signed a law that was to govern the elections.[] This law made the following provisions: 44
The populace would vote for individual candidates rather than political parties in the parliamentary elections.
Government officials who sought office as candidates, , were required to resign from their government position at least 75 days before the elections.except the president
To be eligible to run, presidential candidates were required to produce at least 10,000 copies of eligible voter registration cards as evidence of voters’ support.
The months leading up to the elections, originally planned for June 2004, saw a significant rise in violence throughout the country, especially directed towards election workers.[] While some of this violence could be attributed to the reemergence of Taliban remnants, there was also a significant acceleration of the insurgency (especially in the east and west of the country) against the Karzai regime and American Forces. Voter registration soared in the anticipation of “free and fair” elections with most eligible voters registering even under the cloud of Taliban threats to kill registrants.[] While 9 million of the eligible 9.8 eligible voters registered, the registration process saw blatant irregularities. “In the provinces of Khost, Nooristan, Paktia, and Paktika, voter-registration rates exceeded eligible voters by 140 percent. In 13 of the 34 Afghan provinces voter registration exceeded the number of eligible voters.”[] All of these provinces lie along the Afghan-Pakistan border where Taliban and insurgent attacks have been frequent. Six other predominantly Pashtun provinces (Laghman, Nangarhar, Kunar, Ghazni, Helmand and Kandahar) were also reportedly over-registered, compared to only three predominantly non-Pashtun provinces—Balkh, Badghis and Herat. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) refused to send election monitors to Afghanistan, because they believed that “the present conditions in Afghanistan [were] significantly below the minimum regarded by OSCE... as necessary for credible election observation.”[] 45 46 47 48
Considerable politicking reminiscent of the best western political machines took place in the months before the election, partly indicative of the number of candidates on the ballot. In December 2003, Karzai with the encouragement of the United States tried to undercut support for the Taliban by inviting “moderate supporters” of the Taliban, who also happened to be mostly ethnic Pashtuns, to join the political process in an exchange for their agreement to cease fighting the government.[] Tajik leaders who thought that Karzai’s appeal to the Taliban was another indication of Karzai’ 49
