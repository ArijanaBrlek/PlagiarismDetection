Ventral bone of the belt of the thoracic member (scapular), long bone.
Characterized by:
- its situation: under cutaneous (fracture attends)
- its direction obliques in crial, side, dorsal
- its form in S Italic.
The clavicle is located between the sternum and the acromion.
Its Italic S curve increases its resistance (5 times more solid than a simple rectilinear rod), this form is typical mankind.
It has two curves. A convex curve into ventral close to the sternum, a concave curve into ventral close to the acromion into side.
It presents:
- two iphyses - miale or sternale
- side or acromiale.
1) The BODY flattened in tile present:
- two faces (criale and caudal)
- two edges (ventral and dorsal)
a) Criale face convex, smooth, under cutaneous, palpaple.
b) Caudal face presence of several reliefs
- average part: gouttie du muscle sub clavier.
- miale part: print for the insertion of the ligament costo claviculaire.
- side part: print for insertions of the ligaments coraco-claviculaire with:
- the tuber conoe
- the trapezoidal line.
c) Ventral edge curve identical to the clavicle in S Italic, into side it presents the tuber deltoien.
d) Bord Dorsal its curve is reversed, in its miale part it limits into ventral the procession costo-claviculaire giving passage to the vessels and the nerves of the thoracic member.
2) EPIPHYSES
a) Epiphyse Miale (sternale): bulky, it has an articular surface sternale divided into two: for the sternum in mial, for the first coast into side.
b) Side Epiphyse (acromiale): flattened, it has an articular surface acromiale for the acromion.
