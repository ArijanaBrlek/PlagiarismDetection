Lake Michigan Beach Vacation
"The Surf Cottage" on Lake Michigan - A Northern Michigan Romantic Getaway
 
Ski Lodging near Nub's Nob and Boyne Highlands!   Cheaper with more amenities than a hotel!
 
This new home is complete with a Sandy Beach, Amazing Views, AC, Fireplace, Pool Table, a second TV for kids and 60's period themed video library. 
 
 
We hope to be your Michigan Beach Vacation Destination!
Ok, so the surfing's not as good as Oahu's North Shore but it is just as beautiful!!
 
New for 2006, this cottage style home has 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and a total living area 2,400 sq. ft. Plenty of room to spread out. This house is truly designed with the family in mind, with separate spaces for the grown-ups and kids alike.
 
Vintage Mod, Baby!It's, with a retro feel - sure to evoke a flashback or two. The shag carpeting, custom ceramic tile, custom woodwork and a mix of retro antiques and custom furniture (not to mention a few surprises), will help make this a vacation to remember.luxurious
 
Located in Harbor Springs opposite Lake Michigan on the famous Tunnel of Trees - a popular destination for bicyclists. You're close to such vacation spots as Petoskey, Charlevoix, Cross Village, The Inland Water Way and The Straits of Mackinaw.
 
Atop this 130' bluff,  witness panoramic views that will allow you to see all the way to Charlevoix and on some days even Beaver Island!  Enjoy these views from the home as well as from the meandering bluffside staircase with secluded sun deck that leads to  on Lake Michigan.  150' of very private sandy frontage
