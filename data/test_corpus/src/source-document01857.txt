Perhaps more than any other individual, Juan Trippe is responsible for the development of the commercial airline industry in the 20th Century. Trippe was a visionary who believed that aviation had the power to connect nations and bring people together. He thought that flying should be affordable for everyone - not just the wealthy. A man of tremendous persuasive ability, he forced an entire industry to follow his lead.Trippe's interest in aviation manifested itself in 1917 when he began taking classes at the Curtiss Flying School in Miami. That same year, he left Yale University to become a Navy bomber pilot. Although he never saw any action, Trippe returned to Yale so captivated by flying that he founded the university's first aviation club. Throughout his career, Juan Trippe had an uncanny ability to foresee changes in the aviation industry before they happened. Trippe's early bid to dominate the overseas routes gained an enormous boost when he succeed in convincing the most famous aviator in the world, , to work for his airline. Trippe flew with Lindbergh as they mapped out new air routes for Pan Am in the early 1930s. Sharing a belief in aviation's ability to open up new worlds, the two would remain life-long friends. In 1934, Trippe made a startling announcement, "Pan Am is going to conquer the Pacific." Flying an airliner across the Pacific was thought to be impossible, since there were not enough places to land and refuel in the vast stretch of open water between America and China. Trippe went to the office of the postmaster general with a proposition: if Pan Am found a way to cross the Pacific, it would be guaranteed all of the airmail contracts to the Far East. Surprisingly, the Roosevelt administration agreed to this monopolistic deal. They decided that it was in the national interest to allow Pan Am to do what it had done in the Caribbean - blaze a path behind which American business and the American military could follow. Trippe spent millions to oufit a ship that would sail to Wake Island, a tiny piece of land that he knew almost nothing about, and build an airport. Over the course of nine lonely months, they transformed the three square mile island from an almost barren, uninhabited wasteland into a bustling town with streets, a dock and a seaport. were soon crossing the Pacific. Juan Trippe's gamble had paid off for Pan Am.
Trippe interest in flying led him to begin the first aviation club at Yale.
After graduation, Trippe attempted a conventional Wall Street career, but soon realized his true passion lay in flying. He began making plans to start a new airline. Based in New York, his company would fly to foreign cities. Backed by rich friends, Trippe opened the offices of in 1927. Taking advantage of his connections with the political elite, he got the first U. S. government air mail routes to the Carribean. As a young man, Juan Trippe - named after his mother's favorite aunt, Juanita - started calling himself Terry, a seemingly more appropriate name for someone from a prosperous family of White Anglo Saxon Protestants. Hoping to negotiate better deals if foreign business associates assumed he was Spanish, Trippe switched back to using the name Juan. Pan American Airways Pan Am
Trippe began a life-long friendship with Charles Lindbergh in 1928 when he asked Lindbergh to serve as a consultant to Pan Am.
