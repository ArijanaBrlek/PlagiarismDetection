oneTHANK YOU, TERRY!
Moving back to the East coast to play with the West Point Band has provided the opportunity to study with Joe Alessi of the New York Philharmonic.  Joe is a hero to trombone players worldwide for his musicianship and wonderful trombone playing.  When he comes to perform with the West Point Band, he inspires everyone.  He has asked me to ush the limit, like taming a wild animal.span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  His words, patience, caring and musical guidance have changed my life. THANK YOU, JOE!
Perhaps my greatest teacher was my mother, Marian C. Salimando.  She told me I have beautiful and special sound.span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   Somehow, her confidence in me has carried me through the years; Ie never forgotten how much she believed in me.  Marian was the strength and light of our family and passed on to her four children her unique insight into dealing with the world.  She always said f you can get up in the morning and look yourself in the mirror, then who cares what anyone else thinks.b>  THANK YOU, MOM!
I hope that these experiences and words of wisdom inspire you to play the trombone and appreciate your teachers and colleagues along the way. I feel blessed to have had such great influences in my life.  Each one of these teachers is a part of my sound and music every day.  The journey so far has been beautiful.  There have been a few bumps and ditches, but the mountaintops and stars have made it all worthwhile.
Written on 9/11 2003.  Playing a 9/11 memorial ceremony in Albany, N.Y. with the Concert Band this morning made me want to publicly thank those people in my life who have been so giving and inspiring.
