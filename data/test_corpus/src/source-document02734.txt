Starting a business
Home-based business A wide range of government assistance is available to new home-based businesses. You may also wish to seek the assistance of a solicitor, accountant or business adviser.
When youre starting any business there are many issues to consider. Weve covered the general ones in our guide, but people intending to use their home as a place of business often have to comply with particular state, territory and local government regulations. These regulations often address the impact your business activities may have on the surrounding area (e.g. pollution, energy use or parking). Some issues to consider are: starting a business
council approval - zoning, signage, health issues
home mortgage and rental agreement restrictions
insurance - ensure you have the correct level to protect yourself
financial management - arranging finance and setting up systems
