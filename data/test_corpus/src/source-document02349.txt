For the August, 1942 landings on Tulagi see Allied Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo
Throughout most of April, the Japanese conducted "desultory" bombing raids on Tulagi that caused little, if any, damage. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal were usually able to radio advance warning to the Australian troops on Tulagi of the approaching Japanese aircraft, but the troops did not have large enough weaponry (three and one ) to seriously challenge the Japanese bombers. On 25 April, Tulagi was bombed by eight Japanese aircraft. Similar raids occurred daily over the next week, with one raid on 1 May heavily damaging one of the Catalinas at Gavutu. The remaining Catalinas successfully evacuated that same day. On 2 May, coastwatcher Jack Read on Bougainville reported that a large force of Japanese ships, believed to be part of the Japanese Tulagi invasion force, had departed from the Buka area. Later that day, coastwatcher D. G. Kennedy on island sighted and reported a large Japanese force of ships heading towards the southern Solomons. Soon after, Goode and Peagam, anticipating that the Japanese would attack with overwhelming numbers, ordered the execution of a pre-planned evacuation operation and began the destruction and demolition of their equipment and facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. The RAAF personnel and commandos embarked on two small ships early in the morning on 3 May to begin ther trip to Vila, New Hebrides, just as Shima's ships entered Savo sound to begin their landings on Tulagi. The ship with the RAAF personnel spent the day with coastwatcher and protectorate district officer at Aola on Guadalcanal and departed that night. At 07:01 on 4 May, launched a first strike consisting of 12 and 28 from a position about 160 kilometres (100 mi) south of Guadalcanal. The aircraft began their attacks on Shima's ships anchored near Tulagi at 08:50, taking the Japanese ships by surprise and at anchor. The and the two destroyers were positioned to provide a protective barrier for Shima's other ships that were busy unloading troops and materiel. Although the U.S. pilots from the first strike claimed many bomb and torpedo hits on the anchored ships, they actually only hit , causing minor damage, and , causing major damage. , with the assistance of one of the subchasers, was beached on Gavutu in an attempt to keep her from sinking. During this time, all of the other ships weighed anchor and attempted to escape from the harbor. One U.S. dive bomber destroyed a Japanese F1M2 "Pete" seaplane that attempted to take off during the attack. second strike, utilizing the same aircraft, returned to Tulagi and began their attack at 12:10 on the Japanese ships, many of which were now at full steam and attempting to put distance between themselves and Tulagi harbor. The second strike hit and sank the minesweepers and and severely damaged northeast of . Another Japanese seaplane was shot down by a U.S. dive bomber during the second strike. After four fighters from joined the strike, the fighters shot down two more Japanese floatplanes over . The four U.S. fighters then strafed , killing her captain and nine others of her crew, and causing moderate damage to the ship. Two or three other Japanese floatplanes were damaged in Tulagi harbor and their crews were killed. Despite the damaging air attacks to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded with the construction of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational and began conducting air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12 ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and based at Port Moresby, , , and frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.

Without the means to capably resist the Japanese offensive in the Solomons, the British of the Solomon Islands protectorate and the few Australian troops assigned to defend Tulagi evacuated the island just before the Japanese forces arrived on 3 May. The next day, however, a U.S. enroute to resist the Japanese forces advancing on Port Moresby (that resulted in the ) struck the Japanese Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of the Japanese ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation.

On 7 December 1941, the U.S. Pacific fleet at , . The attack crippled most of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's battleships and started a formal between the two nations. In launching this war, Japanese leaders sought to neutralize the American fleet, seize possessions rich in natural resources, and obtain strategic military bases to defend their far-flung empire. Soon after, other nations, including the , , and joined the United States as in the war against Japan. In the words of the Japanese Navy's "Secret Order Number One", dated 1 November 1941, the goals of the initial Japanese campaigns in the impending war were to, "(eject) British and American strength from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines, (and) to establish a policy of autonomous self-sufficiency and economic independence." To support these goals, during the first few months of 1942 Japanese forces also attacked and took control of the , , , , the , , , , and . the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor Hawaii state of war United Kingdom Australia New Zealand Allies Combined Fleet [8] Philippines Thailand Malaya Singapore Netherlands East Indies Wake Island New Britain Gilbert Islands Guam [9]

The plan also included the seizure of Tulagi, a small island in the southern Solomon Islands, where a seaplane base would be set up for potential air operations against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific. Although Japanese Admiral , commander of the Combined Fleet, was concurrently planning an operation that he hoped would lure the Pacific fleet into a decisive showdown in the central Pacific, he detached some of his large warships to support the operation and placed Inoue in charge of the naval portion of the operation.

Supporting the Japanese landings were seaplanes from the Japanese seaplane tender , temporarily based at Rekata Bay at . About 400 Japanese naval troops, mainly from the 3rd Kure , disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor as part of the establishment of the planned seaplane base there.Kamikawa Maru Santa Isabel [23] Special Naval Landing Force [24] [25]

The Japanese suffered one light carrier sunk, another carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the . Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an overland attack along the . The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.YorktownLexington Battle of the Coral Sea LexingtonYorktown Battle of Midway Kokoda Trail [38]

The Allies were greatly concerned about the Japanese airfield construction effort on Guadalcanal because, when completed, the aircraft operating from the airfield would be a significant threat to Allied operations between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The two strategic victories for the Allies in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway provided an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. An Allied plan to attack the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral , Commander in Chief, . He proposed the offensive to deny the use of the southern Solomon Islands by the Japanese as to threaten the routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to use them as starting points for a . His goal was to neutralize or capture the major Japanese base at while also supporting the Allied , with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines. U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz, Allied commander in chief for Pacific forces, created the South Pacific theater, with U.S. Vice Admiral in command, to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons.

The failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby and their defeat at Midway had the effect of "dangling" their base at Tulagi without effective protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base. On 7 August 1942, 11,000 landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the while the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured the without significant resistance. Thus, began the that resulted in a series of large, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next six months which, along with the , would decide the fate of Japanese efforts to secure the southern frontier of their empire in the Pacific.
