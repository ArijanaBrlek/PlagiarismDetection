In complicated pregnancy, fetal hypoxemia rarely occurs in isolationbut is often accompanied by fetal acidemia. There is growingclinical concern about the combined effects of fetal hypoxemiaand fetal acidemia on neonatal outcome. However, the effectson the fetal defense responses to acute hypoxemia during fetalacidemia are not well understood. This study tested the hypothesisthat fetal acidemia affects the fetal defense responses to acutehypoxemia. The hypothesis was tested by investigating, in thelate-gestation sheep fetus surgically prepared for long-termrecording, the in vivo effects of acute fetal acidemia on )the fetal cardiovascular responses to acute hypoxemia and )the neural and endocrine mechanisms mediating these responses.Under general anesthesia, five sheep fetuses at 0.8 gestationwere instrumented with catheters and Transonic flow probes aroundthe femoral and umbilical arteries. After 5 days, animals weresubjected to an acute hypoxemia protocol during intravenousinfusion of saline or treatment with acidified saline. Treatmentwith acidified saline reduced fetal basal pH from 7.35 ±0.01 to 7.29 ± 0.01 but did not alter basal cardiovascularvariables, blood glucose, or plasma concentrations of catecholamines,ACTH, and cortisol. During hypoxemia, treatment with acidifiedsaline increased the magnitude of the fetal bradycardia andfemoral vasoconstriction and concomitantly increased chemoreflexfunction and enhanced the increments in plasma concentrationsof catecholamines, ACTH, and cortisol. Acidemia also reversedthe increase in umbilical vascular conductance during hypoxemiato vasoconstriction. In conclusion, the data support our hypothesisand show that acute acidemia markedly alters fetal hemodynamic,metabolic, and endocrine responses to acute hypoxemia.12
