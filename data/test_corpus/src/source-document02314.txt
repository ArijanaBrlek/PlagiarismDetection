780.402Section Number:
The general guides for applying the exemption.Section Name:
(a) Like other exemptions provided by the Act, the section 13(b)(12)  exemption is narrowly construed (Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 334 U.S.  490; Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11; Calaf v. Gonzalez, 127 F. 2d 934;  Fleming v. Hawkeye Pearl Button Co., 113 F. 2d 52; Fleming v. Swift &  Co., 41 F. Supp. 825; Miller Hatcheries v. Boyer, 131 F. 2d 283; Walling  v. Friend, 156 F. 2d 429; see also Sec. 780.2 of subpart A of this part  780). An employer who claims the exemption has the burden of showing  that it applies. (See Sec. 780.2) The section 13(b)(12) exemption for  employment in agriculture is intended to cover all agriculture,  including ``extraordinary methods'' of agriculture as well as the more  conventional ones and large operators as well as small ones.  Nevertheless, it was meant to apply only to agriculture. It does not  extend to processes that are more akin to manufacturing than to  agriculture. Practices performed off the farm by nonfarmers are not  within the exemption, except for the irrigation activities specifically  described in section 13(b)(12). Practices performed by a farmer do not  come within the exemption for agriculture if they are neither a part of  farming nor performed by him as an incident to or in conjunction with  his own farming operations. These principles have been well established  by the courts in such cases as Mitchell v. Budd, 350 U.S. 473; Maneja v.  Waialua, 349 U.S. 254; Farmers Reservoir Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755;  Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, 322 U.S. 607; Calaf v. Gonzalez,  127 F. 2d 934; Chapman v. Durkin, 214 F. 2d 363, certiorari denied, 348  U.S. 897; McComb v. Puerto Rico Tobacco Marketing Co-op. Ass'n. 80 F.  Supp. 953, 181 F. 2d 697.     (b) When the Congress, in the 1961 amendments, provided special  exemptions for some activities which had been held not to be included in  the exemption for agriculture (see subparts F and J of this part 780),  it was made very clear that no implication of disagreement with ``the  principles and tests governing the application of the present  agriculture exemption as enunciated by the courts'' was intended  (Statement of the Managers on the part of the House, Conference Report,  H. Rept. No. 327, 87th Cong. first sess., p. 18). Accordingly, an  employee is considered an exempt agricultural or irrigation employee if,  but only if, his work falls clearly within the specific language of  section 3(f) or section 13(b)(12).
