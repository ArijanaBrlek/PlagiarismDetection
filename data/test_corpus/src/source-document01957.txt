Flames and Fire
Flame tattoos have been around for many years, but really started to gain popularity in the last half of the 20th century. Fire, however, dates back to the beginning of civilization, and marked a turning point in human evolution.
Once fire was "discovered" and harnessed, people (at that time, Neanderthals or cavemen) could enjoy the civility of a warm place to stay and cooked food. Fire lit caves and huts, and provided a way to keep the cold at bay. Some of the earliest cave paintings found, from tens of thousands of years ago, included pictures of fire. It's only natural that people will still honor this life-giving force by having pictures of it inked on their bodies.
