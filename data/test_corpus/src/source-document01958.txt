Children and adolescents exhibiting developmental delays or acquiring an acute injury require comprehensive rehabilitation to address the deficits affecting their daily functioning. At Miami Children's Hospital, a full range of bilingual diagnostic and therapeutic services is available to meet the needs of infants, children, and adolescents. All services are performed by a team of professionals who focus on the medical, therapeutic, and educational needs of the child. Miami Children's Hospital's rehabilitative setting includes the neonatal intensive care unit, inpatient hospitalization areas, and an outpatient rehabilitation department. These areas utilize state-of-the-art equipment in a patient-friendly environment for children of all ages. The first step in rehabilitating a child is to provide a team of pediatric rehabilitation specialists who understand the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of children at different stages of life. The specialists include audiologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and/or speech language pathologists. After a comprehensive evaluation, a treatment plan is developed with the child's family to enable patients to reach their maximum level of functional ability as quickly as possible.
