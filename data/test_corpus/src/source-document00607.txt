  Tips to Help Women Avoid Osteoporosis   Osteoporosis is reversible with diet changes & lifestyle change
 
We can control all the factors that contribute to osteoporotic fractures, but there a lot women can do to strengthen and preserve their bones, reports Harvard Women Health Watch. Here are eight things to keep in mind:
Maintain a healthy diet that provides bone-building nutrients, including potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin D.1. Get vital nutrients:
Get at least 30 minutes of bone-strengthening activity most days. Include both weight-bearing activities, like running or brisk walking, and resistance exercise.2. Exercise:
Smokers lose bone faster and have higher fracture rates.3. Don smoke:
Most guidelines recommend osteoporosis screening through bone mineral density (BMD) testing starting at age 65arlier for women who have health conditions or take medications that increase risk.4. Know your risk:
Postmenopausal women whoe had a fracture or received a BMD score of .5 or worse should take an osteoporosis drug. Women with scores of .0 to .5 should consider medication.5. Consider bone-preserving drugs:
Research has found links between depression and bone loss. For example, women with a history of major depression have lower bone density and higher levels of cortisol, a hormone related to bone loss. If youe being treated for depression, ask your clinician about whether you should have a BMD test.6. Be aware of the depression connection:
Weighing less than 127 pounds or having a body mass index under 21 is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Also, if you lose weight during the menopausal transition, youe more likely to lose bone. Avoid ultra-low-calorie diets and diets that eliminate whole food groups.7. Maintain a healthy weight:
Keep floors clear of tripping hazards, make sure stairways and entrances are well lit, and add grab bars to your bathtub or shower.8. Avoid falls:
