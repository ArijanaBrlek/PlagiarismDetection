Go for the Green
Tom Green hosts a show called Go for the Green which is a fun, high energy elimination game show where 50 members of our live audience compete to stay in the game and prove that, like our host Tom Green, they're GREEN too! It's survival of the fittest, and by the end of the show two finalists will face off in a tension filled game to win our grand prize -- a fantastic green weekend getaway.
