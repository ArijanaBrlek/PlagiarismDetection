BUYING HOME EXERCISE EQUIPMENT
By Mary Pearsall Co-Creator of Trainer To Go
The right home exercise equipment can add variety, convenience and consistency to your workouts. But too often, you've purchased a piece of equipment, you realize you've made a mistake. Here are a few cautions that will help you avoid the 10 most common mistakes.after
Like moths to a flame, people are drawn to cardiovascular equipment that have every conceivable readout and calculation. These gadgets often go unused, though, so they may not be the best place to spend your money.1. Don't Overbuy Features.
Sturdy construction and smooth, quiet operation are what matter most. For example, with treadmills, good deck cushioning and stability are key factors to look for.2. Don't Skimp on the Basics.
Almost any treadmill feels fine during the first few minutes. Only when doing a longer workout will you notice things like excessive vibration and noise. For cardio machines, spend at least 20 minutes trying different programs; for strength equipment, do a set of 10 repetitions.3. Avoid Fast or Sight-Unseen Purchasing.
If you don't try the best equipment first, you won't know what quality features to look for. Stay away from infomercial products or other low-price equipment. A store specializing in fitness equipment is probably the best place to start your search. It's not a bad idea to stick to brands you've used in health clubs - a manufacturer's quality often carries over into home models.4. Don't Ignore the Top of the Line.
An exercise or movement that looks easy on TV may not work for you. For example, ski machines with independent upper and lower- body motions may offer an outstanding cardio workout, but they also require a high level of concentration and coordination. People are less likely to use machines that have a high learning curve.5. Don't Overestimate Your Abilities.
When purchasing a strength training machine, look for one with simple procedures for changing weight. If adjusting the weight isn't mind-numbingly simple, you're not likely to do it!
Although treadmills are extremely popular and relialbe, elliptical trainers also provide functional movement with lots of variety. Stationery bikes - both upright and recumbant - are rebounding in popularity. Stair steppers, rowing machines, home gyms and equipment for exercise based on the work of Joseph Pilates are additional options.6. Don't Limit Your Options.
Make sure the rowing machine you are thinking of buying doesn't put too many demands on your back. If you are looking at treadmills and are overweight or have orthopedic concerns, check for sturdy handrails, gradual pace changes and structural integrity. Look for a home gym that will adjust to your body height and size.7. Don't Ignore Your Personal Comfort.
Some fitness products that sound great on infomercials have limited effectiveness. Abdominal exercise devices, for example, don't really offer any results beyond those achieved by doing abdominal exercises without equipment. ( However, the devices can provide some head and neck support, if they fit your body size properly).8. Don't Believe Everything You Hear.
Ask questions of other exercisers and fitness professionals, as well as equipment representatives. Before buying, find out about equipment delivery, setup, warranties and return policies.9. Don't Go It Alone.
Not all effective exercise eqiuipment needs assembly and takes up a lot of space. I highly recommended heart rate monitors and the Caltrac accelerometer that measures your caloric expenditure and can keep you on track with calorie goals for your exercise sessions. Fitness balls, bands, tubing and exercise videos can also add safety, creativity, comfort and variety to your activity program. The best investment of all may well be the least expensive - a water bottle!10. Don't Overlook The Little Things.
