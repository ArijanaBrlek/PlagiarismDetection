Oak Grove Middle School presents it’s Fourth annual musical theatre production at 7 p.m. March 10 and 11 and 1 p.m. on March 12 at Oak Grove Middle School.
Performances of "The Music Man" could follow past tradition by performing to sell-out crowds as they did for “Wizard of Oz”, “Peter Pan” and “Oliver!” Most of last year's cast is returning, as well as many siblings of past actors. "So the experience and character depth is sure to be like no other show, said Jennie Berglund, Music Man co-director.
"Music Man" features famous songs such as, “Wells Fargo Wagon,” “76 Trombones,” “Iowa Stubborn” and “Till There was You.” Before your eyes Oak Grove Middle Schoolers will become stubborn Iowans.
Berglund and Bryan Blessing, co-director, are thrilled to be working with such an amazing cast, crew and parents.  Staff include: set designer, Dohn Thibault; costume, make-up and hair designers, Mary Jane Harmon and Stephanie; Kristen VanSchyndel, choreographer from the Kennedy Kolleens.
