Training with a Multigym system is not just for bodybuilding. On the contrary, strong muscles are neccessary in order to stay young. It is only by this type of training that fat can be burnt and you can acheive stronger muscles. Toned muscles protect the joints, tendons and ligaments from tears and strains. Individual muscle parts can be targeted for training as the movement is guided by the machine, and workout stations can be utilised according to your personal needs. The correct choice of training weight and proper execution of the exercises will help you to achieve your personal objective. There are many options available, and nearly all systems have their own weight stack, and some with pulley systems that can multiply the resistance of the weights you are lifting. Most basic machines include chest press, pec-dec, leg curl/extension, and lat pulldown workout stations, but many additional features can be found to suit your needs. With certain ranges of multigyms, there are "add-ons" available which can be purchased with the basic machine, or added later.
