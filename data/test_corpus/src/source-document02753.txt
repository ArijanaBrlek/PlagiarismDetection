The H1500 is one of the highest power-density modules available in the PV market, thanks to Helios Technology’s advanced production processes and its high-efficiency I-Max® monocrystalline cells. The H1500 module is very suitable for grid-connected systems such as photovoltaic roofs, but great results will be obtained as well when it is used for systems with batteries, where grid connection is not available or too far from the user. The H1500 module is composed of 36 HT 165x165mm high-efficiency I-Max® monocrystalline cells and it has been developed by Helios Technology to operate under the toughest environmental conditions. The high power supplied by the H1500 module gives to the installer the advantage that fewer units need to be lifted up, installed and interconnected, than for smaller modules. This is particularly important for grid-connected applications and big-size systems where are required low installation costs. Thanks to the I-Max® technology developed by Helios Technology for its range of high-efficiency modules, the H1500 module performs an increased current output (10-17%) at the operating battery voltage when it is installed in stand-alone systems. Up to now Helios Technology’s modules have guaranteed an average lifetime more than 30 years.
