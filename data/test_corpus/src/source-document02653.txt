HI LAURIE 
First, thank you for writing such an incredible resource for those of us who are owned by pets with cancer. My own Mango was just diagnosed with lymphoma and I have been searching desperately for information that will help me extend his life.
Thanks so much for taking the time to put tegether the information in "Help Your Dog Fight Cancer."

The book was really a bible of information that I relied upon time and time again. I had certain pages marked, like the pages containing what types of side effects were assiciated with which drugs. I was also thankful that I could grab the book and take it with me anywhere - like to the oncologist to ask about specific therapies, or to re-read while I waited for an appointment.
