appraisals deliver professionalism & long termPRAMARKET INSIGHT,EXPERIENCE
PRA is fully accredited wit the Appraisal Institute of Canada.  This puts us in the best position to provide defendable rationale and concrete solutions to the ever-evolving determination of value.  How to estimate value, how to identify opportunity and how to minimize risk are core functions where clients look to us for guidance.
 
Daily Practices in our various departments allow PRA to be well equipped in reading and interpreting the variables that influence the real estate market at any given time.   Our diversity affords clients an expert service that combines data from all parts of the market into an extensive, comprehensive and accurate in-house real estate data-base.  This equates to efficiency in our day to day operations and translates into savings in time and dollars for PRA clients.
    
Since a sound opinion of value requires much more than an accurate interpretation of past market data, it makes keeping current a major challenge.  Our appraisers keep current on market trends and conditions, as well as prevailing evaluation issues like fluctuating levels of demand, and interest rates.  To ensure we deliver justifiable and accurate analyses, we also keep abreast of new government regulations, development charges, and zoning and environmental issues.  Most importantly, at PRA we have the experience to correctly interpret and weigh the influence of each factor into the mix.
 
PRA provides valuable analytical expertise and market insight to private, corporate, and public sector clients alike.  All appraisals are performed in accordance with the Canadian Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice as defined by the Appraisal Institute of Canada.  PRA also lends its expertise for Litigation Support and Testimony before the counts and various tribunals.
