One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, aboveall other sciences, is that its propositions are absolutely certo some extent debatable and in constant danger of being ferent persons should arrive at the same logical conclusionstain and indisputable, while those of all other sciences areoverthrown by newly discovered facts. In spite of this, theinvestigator in another department of science would not needto envy the mathematician if the propositions of mathematics referred to objects of our mere imagination, and not toobjects of reality. For it cannot occasion surprise that difwhen they have already agreed upon the fundamental propositions (axioms), as well as the methods by which otherpropositions are to be deduced therefrom. But there isanother reason for the high repute of mathematics, in thatit is mathematics, which affords the exact natural sciences acertain measure of certainty, to which without mathematicsthey could not attain.
At this point an enigma presents itself, which in all ageshas agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which isindependent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? Is human reason, then, without experience,merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties ofreal things?
In my opinion the answer to this question is, briefly, this:as far as the propositions of mathematics refer to reality, theyare not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do notrefer to reality. It seems to me that complete clarity as to thisstate of things became common property only through that trend in mathematics, which is known by the name of "axiomatics." The progress achieved by axiomatics consistsin its having neatly separated the logical-formal from itsobjective or intuitive content; according toaxiomatics the logical-formalalone forms the subject matter of mathematics, which is not concerned with the intuitive or other content associated with the logical-formal.
Let us for a moment consider from this point of view anyaxiom of geometry, for instance, the following: through twopoints in space there always passes one and only one straightline. How is this axiom to be interpreted in the older senseand in the more modern sense?
The older interpretation: everyone knows what a straight line is, and what a point is. Whether this knowledge springsfrom an ability of the human mind or from experience, fromsome cooperation of the two or from some other source, isnot for the mathematician to decide. He leaves the question to the philosopher. Being based upon this knowledge, whichprecedes all mathematics, the axiom stated above is, like allother axioms, self-evident, that is, it is the expression of apart of thisa prioriknowledge.
The more modern interpretation: geometry treats of objects, which are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. No knowledge or intuition of these objects is assumed i.e., axioms are free creations of the human mind. All otherbut only the validity of the axioms, such as the one statedabove, which are to be taken in a purely formal sense,as void of all content of intuition or experience. Thesepropositions of geometry are logical inferences from theaxioms (which are to be taken in the nominalistic senseonly). The axiomsdefinethe objects of which geometry treats. Schlick in his book on epistemology has thereforecharacterized axioms very aptly as "implicit definitions."
This view of axioms, advocated by modern axiomatics,Purges mathematics of all extraneous elements, and thus dispels the mystic obscurity, which formerly surrounded thebasis of mathematics. But such anexpurgated exposition ofmathematics makes it also evidentthat mathematics as suchcannot predicate anything about objects of our intuition orreal objects. In axiomatic geometry the words "point,""straight line," etc., stand only for empty conceptualschemata. That which gives them content is not relevant tomathematics.
Yet on the other hand it is certain that mathematics generally, and particularly geometry, owes its existence to theneed which was felt of learning something about the behavior of real objects. The very word geometry, which, of course,means earth-measuring, proves this. For earth-measuringhas to do with the possibilities of the disposition of certainnatural objects with respect to one another, namely, with bodies. To be able to make such assertions, geometry must coordination of real objects of experience with the empty ior of practically-rigid bodies.parts of the earth, measuring-lines, measuring-wands, etc.It is clear that the system of concepts of axiomatic geometry alone cannot make any assertions as to the behavior ofreal objects of this kind, which we will call practically-rigidbe stripped of its merely logical-formal character by theconceptual schemata of axiomatic geometry. To accomplishthis, we need only add the proposition: solid bodies arerelated, with respect to their possible dispositions, as arebodies in Euclidean geometry of three dimensions. Then the propositions of Euclid contain affirmations as to the behav
Geometry thus completed is evidently a natural science; we may in fact regard it as the most ancient branch of measurements in physics constitute practical geometry in agated in a straight line, and indeed in a straight line in thephysics. Its affirmations rest essentially on induction from experience, but not on logical inferences only. We will callthis completed geometry "practical geometry," and shall distinguish it in what follows from "purely axiomatic geometry." The question whether the practical geometry of theuniverse is Euclidean or not has a clear meaning, and itsanswer can only be furnished by experience. All length-this sense, so, too, do geodetic and astronomical length measurements, if one utilizes the empirical law that light is propsense of practical geometry.
I attach special importance to the view of geometry, whichI have just set forth, because without it I should have been tained by that acute and profound thinker, H. Poincarunable to formulate the theory of relativity. Without it the following reflection would have been impossible: in a system of reference rotating relatively to an inertial system, thelaws of disposition of rigid bodies do not correspond to therules of Euclidean geometry on account of the Lorentz contraction; thus if we admit non-inertial systems on an equalfooting, we must abandon Euclidean geometry. Without theabove interpretation the decisive step in the transition togenerally covariant equations would certainly not have beentaken. If we reject the relation between the body of axiomaticEuclidean geometry and the practically-rigid body of reality, we readily arrive at the following view, which was enterEuclidean geometry is distinguished above all other conceivable axiomatic geometries by its simplicity. Now sinceaxiomatic geometry by itself contains no assertions as to the reality which can be experienced, but can do so only in combination with physical laws, it should be possible and reasonable/span>whatever may be the nature of reality/span>to retainEuclidean geometry. For if contradictions between theoryand experience manifest themselves, we should rather decide to change physical laws than to change axiomatic Euclideangeometry. If we reject the relation between the practically-rigid body and geometry, we shall indeed not easily free ourselves from the convention that Euclidean geometry is to beretained as the simplest.
Why is the equivalence of the practically-rigid body and
the body of geometryhich suggests itself so readily/span>rejected by Poincarand other investigators? Simply because under closer inspection the real solid bodies in nature are notrigid, because their geometrical behavior, that is, their possibilities of relative disposition, depend upon temperature,external forces, etc. Thus the original, immediate relationbetween geometry and physical reality appears destroyed, (P); of (P) are together in accord with experience. Envisaged inand we feel impelled toward the following more generalview, which characterizes Poincars standpoint. Geometry(G) predicates nothing about the behavior of real things, butonly geometry together with the totality (P) of physical lawscan do so. Using symbols, we may say that only the sum of(G) + (P) is subject to experimental verification. Thus (G)may be chosen arbitrarily, and also parts ofall these laws are conventions. All that is necessary to avoid contradictions is to choose the remainder of (P) so that (G) and the wholethis way, axiomatic geometry and the part of natural law,which has been given a conventional status, appear as epistemologically equivalent.
Sub specie aeterniPoincar in my opinion, is right. The idea of the measuring-rod and the idea of the clock coordicorrespondence in the real world. It is also clear that the solid body and the clock do not in the conceptual edifice of present stage of development of theoretical physics these struct solid bodies and clocks theoretically from elementarynated with it in the theory of relativity do not find their exactphysics play the part of irreducible elements, but that ofcomposite structures, which must not play any independentpart in theoretical physics. But it is my conviction that in theconcepts must still be employed as independent concepts; for we are still far from possessing such certain knowledge of thetheoretical principles of atomic structure as to be able to conconcepts.
Further, as to the objection that there are no really rigidbodies in nature, and that therefore the properties predicatedof rigid bodies do not apply to physical reality/span>this objection is by no means so radical as might appear from a hastyexamination. For it is not a difficult task to determine thephysical state of a measuring-body so accurately that itsbehavior relative to other measuring-bodies shall be sufficiently free from ambiguity to allow it to be substituted for the "rigid" body. It is to measuring-bodies of this kind thatstatements about rigid bodies must be referred.
All practical geometry is based upon a principle which is accessible to experience, and which we will now try to realize. Suppose two marks have been put upon a practically-rigid body. A pair of two such marks we shall call a tract. We imagine two practically-rigid bodies, each with a tractmarked out on it. These two tracts are said to be "equal toone another" if the marks of the one tract can be brought tocoincide permanently with the marks of the other. We nowassume that:
If two tracts are found to be equal once and anywhere,they are equal always and everywhere.
Not only the practical geometry of Euclid, but also its nearest generalization, the practical geometry of Riemann, propagation of light in empty space assigns a tract, namely,and therewith the general theory of relativity, rest upon thisassumption. Of the experimental reasons that warrant thisassumption I will mention only one. The phenomenon of thethe appropriate path of light, to each interval of local time,and conversely. Thence it follows that the above assumption for tracts must also hold good for intervals of clock-timein the theory of relativity. Consequently it may be formulated as follows: if two ideal clocks are going at the same rateat any time and at any place (being then in immediate proximity to each other), they will always go at the same rate,no matter where and when they are again compared witheach other at one place. If this law were not valid for natural clocks, the properfrequencies for the separate atoms ofthe same chemical element would not be in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. The existence of sharpspectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of theabove-mentioned principle of practical geometry. This, inthe last analysis, is the reason that enables us to speakmeaningfully of a Riemannian metric of the four-dimensionalspace-time continuum.
According to the view advocated here, the question to be chosen on grounds of mere expediency. Riemann'swhether this continuum has a Euclidean, Riemannian, or anyother structure is a question of physics proper, which must beanswered by experience, and not a question of a conventiongeometry will hold if the laws of disposition of practically-rigid bodies approach those of Euclidean geometry the moreclosely the smaller the dimensions of the region of space-time under consideration.
It is true that this proposed physical interpretation of geometry breaks down when applied immediately to spaces of describing the electrical elementary particles constituting tal principles of Riemann's geometry outside of the domain of their physical definitions. It might possibly turn out thatof submolecular order of magnitude. But nevertheless, evenin questions as to the constitution of elementary particles, itretains part of its significance. For even when it is a questionmatter, the attempt may still be made to ascribe physicalmeaning to those field concepts which have been physicallydefined for the purpose of describing the geometrical behavior of bodies which are large as compared with the molecule.Success alone can decide as to the justification of such anattempt, which postulates physical reality for the fundamenthis extrapolation has no better warrant than the extrapolation of the concept of temperature to parts of a body of molecular order of magnitude.
It appears less problematical to extend the concepts ofpractical geometry to spaces of cosmic order of magnitude. It practical geometry. I do not even consider it impossible that this question will be answered before long by astronomy. Let us call to mind what the general theory of relativity teachesmight, of course, be objected that a construction composedof solid rods departs the more from ideal rigidity the greaterits spatial extent. But it will hardly be possible, I think, toassign fundamental significance to this objection. Thereforethe question whether the universe is spatially finite or notseems to me an entirely meaningful question in the sense ofin this respect. It offers two possibilities:
1. The universe is spatially infinite. This is possible onlyif in the universe the average spatial density of matter, concentrated in the stars, vanishes,i.e., if the ratio of the totalmass of the stars to the volume of the space through whichthey are scattered indefinitely approaches zero as greater andgreater volumes are considered.
2. The universe is spatially finite. This must be so, ifthere exists an average density of the ponderable matter in the universe that is different from zero. The smaller thataverage density, the greater is the volume of the universe.
I must not fail to mention that a theoretical argument canbe adduced in favor of the hypothesis of a finite universe. The general theory of relativity teaches that the inertia of a given body is greater as there are more ponderable massesin proximity to it; thus it seems very natural to reduce thetotal inertia of a body to interaction between it and the otherbodies in the universe, as indeed, ever since Newton's time,gravity has been completely reduced to interaction betweenbodies. From the equations of the general theory of relativityit can be deduced that this total reduction of inertia to interaction between masses/span>exampleas demanded by E. Mach, for/span>is possible only if the universe is spatially finite.
Many physicists and astronomers are not impressed bythis argument. In the last analysis, experience alone candecide which of the two ined may be, we could not feel convinced that there werepossibilities is realized in nature.How can experience furnish an answer? At first it mightseem possible to determine the average density of matter byobservation of that part of the universe that is accessibleto our observation. This hope is illusory. The distributionof the visible stars is extremely irregular, so that we on noaccount may venture to set the average density of star-matter in the universe equal to, let us say, the average densityin the Galaxy. In any case, however great the space examany more stars beyond that space. So it seems impossibleto estimate the average density.
But there is another road, which seems to me more practicable, although it also presents great difficulties. For if weinquire into the deviations of the consequences of the generaltheory of relativity which are accessible to experience, from the consequences of the Newtonian theory, we first of allfind a deviation which manifests itself in close proximity togravitating mass, and has been confirmed in the case of theplanet Mercury. But if the universe is spatially finite, there isa second deviation from the Newtonian theory, which, in thelanguage of the Newtonian theory, may be expressed thus:the gravitational field is such as if it were produced, not onlyby the ponderable masses, but in addition by a mass-densityof negative sign, distributed uniformly throughout space.Since this fictitious mass-density would have to be extremelysmall, it would be noticeable only in very extensive gravitating systems.
Assuming that we know, let us say, the statistical distribution and the masses of the stars in the Galaxy, then byNewton's law we can calculate the gravitational field and theaverage velocities which the stars must have, so that theGalaxy should not collapse under the mutual attraction of its stars, but should maintain its actual extent. Now if the actualvelocities of the stars/span>which can be measurederesmaller than the calculated velocities, we should have a proofthat the actual attractions at great distances are smaller thanby Newton's law. From such a deviation it could be proved ble to estimate its spatial dimensions.indirectly that the universe is finite. It would even be possi
Can we visualize a three-dimensional universe which isfinite, yet unbounded?
The usual answer to this question is"No," to show that the answer should be "Yes." I want to showbut that is notthe right answer. The purpose of the following remarks isthat without any extraordinary difficulty we can illustrate thetheory of a finite universe by means of a mental picture towhich, with some practice, we shall soon grow accustomed.
First of all, an observation of epistemological nature. Ageometrical-physical theory as such is incapable of being directly pictured, being merely a system of concepts. Butthese concepts serve the purpose of bringing a multiplicity ofreal or imaginary sensory experiences into connection in themind. To "visualize" a theory therefore means to bring tomind that abundance of sensible experiences for which the behavior of solid bodies with respect to their mutual dispohas not yet been completely satisfied. So, will the initiated parttheory supplies the schematic arrangement. In the presentcase we have to ask ourselves how we can represent thatsition (contact) that corresponds to the theory of a finiteuniverse. There is really nothing new in what I have to sayabout this; but innumerable questions addressed to me provethat the curiosity of those who are interested in these mattersplease pardon me, in thatof what I shall say has longbeen known?
What do we wish to express when we say that our spaceis infinite? Nothing more than that we might lay any number of bodies of equal sizes side by side without ever fillingspace. Suppose that we are provided with a great many cubicboxes all of the same size. In accordance with Euclideangeometry we can place them above, beside, and behind oneanother so as to fill an arbitrarily large part of space; butthis construction would never be finished; we could go onadding more and more cubes without ever finding that therewas no more room. That is what we wish to express whenwe say that space is infinite. It would be better to say thatspace is infinite in relation to practically-rigid bodies, assuming that the laws of disposition for these bodies are given by Euclidean geometry.
Another example of an infinite continuum is the plane.On a plane surface we may lay squares of cardboard so thateach side of any square has the side of another square adjacent to it. The construction is never finished; we can alwaysgo on laying squares/span>if their laws of disposition correspondto those of plane figures of Euclidean geometry. The plane istherefore infinite in relation to the cardboard squares.Accordingly we say that the plane is an infinite continuum oftwo dimensions, and space an infinite continuum of threedimensions. What is here meant by the number of dimensions, I think I may assume to be known.
FIG. 1
Now we take an example of a two-dimensional continuumthat is finite, but unbounded. We imagine the surface of spherical surface of the globe is an unbounded continuum. we stick the paper discs on the globe, so that no disc overlaps another, the surface of the globe will finally become so plane surface, we obtain an uninterrupted arrangement in that lie on the outside. On the spherical surface the consmaller the radius of the disc in proportion to that of the arrangement of the discs in the manner indicated, without interruption, is not possible, as it should be possible by the from the spherical surface into three-dimensional space, their two-dimensional "space" is not Euclidean, but spheria large globe and a quantity of small paper discs, all of thesame size. We place one of the discs anywhere on the surfaceof the globe. If we move the disc about, anywhere we like,on the surface of the globe, we do not come upon a boundary anywhere on the journey. Therefore we say that theMoreover, the spherical surface is a finite continuum. For iffull that there is no room for another disc. This meansexactly that the spherical surface of the globe is finite in relation to the paper discs. Further, the spherical surface is anon-Euclidean continuum of two dimensions, that is to say,the laws of disposition for the rigid figures lying in it do notagree with those of the Euclidean plane. This can be shownin the following way. Take a disc and surround it in a circleby six more discs, each of which is to be surrounded in turnby six discs, and so on. If this construction is made on awhich there are six discs touching every disc except thosestruction also seems to promise success at the outset, and thesphere, the more promising it seems. But as the construction progresses it becomes more and more patent that theEuclidean geometry of the plane. In this way creatures whichcannot leave the spherical surface, and cannot even peep outmight discover, merely by experimenting with discs, thatcal space.
From the latest results of the theory of relativity it isprobable that our three-dimensional space is also approxiapproximately by spherical geometry, if only we consider parts of space which are sufficiently extended. Now this is the place where the reader's imagination boggles. "Nobodymately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigidbodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, butcan imagine this thing," he cries indignantly. "It can be said,but cannot be thought. I can imagine a spherical surface wellenough, but nothing analogous to it in three dimensions."
We must try to surmount this barrier in the mind, andthe patient reader will attention once more to the geometry of two-dimensionalseethat it is by no means a particularly difficult task. For this purpose we will first give ourspherical surfaces. In the adjoining figure let K be the spherical surface, touched at S by a plane, E, which, for facilityof presentation, is shown in the drawing as a bounded surface. LetLbe a disc on the spherical surface. Now let usimagine that at the point N of the spherical surface, diametrically opposite to S, there is a luminous point, throwing ashadowL'of the discLupon the plane E. Every point onthe sphere has its shadow on the plane. If the disc on thesphere K is moved, its shadow L' on the plane E also moves.When the discLis at S, it almost exactly coincides with itsshadow. If it moves on the spherical surface away from S upwards, the disc shadowL'on the plane also moves awayfrom S on the plane outwards, growing bigger and bigger.As the discLapproaches the luminous point N, the shadowmoves off to infinity, and becomes infinitely great.
 
FIG. 2
Now we put the question: what are the laws of dispositionof the disc-shadowsL'on the plane E? Evidently they areexactly the same as the laws of disposition of the discsLonthe spherical surface. For to each original figure on K thereis a corresponding shadow figure on E. If two discs on Kare touching, their shadows on E also touch. Theshadow-geometry on the plane agrees with the disc-geometry on the sphere. If we call the disc-shadows rigid figures, then spherical geometry holds good on the planeEwith respect tothese rigid figures. In particular, the plane is finite withrespect to the disc-shadows, since only a finite number of theshadows can find room on the plane.
disc-shadows are not rigid figures. We have only to move a as the disc-shadows It would then be impossible to showAt this point somebody will say, "That is nonsense. Thetwo-foot rule about on the planeEto convince ourselves thatthe shadows constantly increase in size as they move awayfrom S on the plane toward infinity." But what if the twofoot rule were to behave on the planeEin the same way?L'that the shadows increase in size as they move away fromS; such an assertion would then no longer have any meaning whatever. In fact the only objective assertion that can bemade about the disc-shadows is just this, that they arerelated in exactly the same way as the rigid discs on thespherical surface in the sense of Euclidean geometry.
as toward infinity, has in itself no objective meaning, as long asWe must carefully bear in mind that our statement as tothe growth of the disc-shadows,they move away from Swe are unable to compare the disc-shadows with Euclidean rigid bodies that can be moved about on the planeE.In respect of the laws of disposition of the shadows,L'thepoint S has no special privileges on the plane any more thanon the spherical surface.
The representation given above of spherical geometry onthe plane is important for us, because it readily allows itselfto be transferred to the three-dimensional case.
