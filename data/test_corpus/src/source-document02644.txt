CCVA adheres to standards established by the National Organizational of Certifying Agencies (NOCA) -- the primary body in the United States for quality assurance of credentials.
Core Competencies
Individuals pursuing the CVA credential are expected to demonstrate successfully their knowledge and ability to apply skills required for competent volunteer management, based on their actual performance in the role. Five core competencies have been identified that serve as a foundation for this profession, regardless of the setting or type of organization where volunteers are at work.
As the result of a Job Analysis study conducted in 2008, the five core competencies are:
EthicsThe ability to act in accordance with professional principles.
Organizational ManagementThe ability to design and implement policies, processes and structures to align volunteer involvement with the mission and vision of the organization.
Human Resource ManagementThe ability to successfully engage, train and support volunteers in a systematic and intentional way.
AccountabilityThe ability to collect relevant data and to engage in meaningful monitoring, evaluation and reporting to stakeholders.
Leadership and AdvocacyThe ability to advance individual, organizational and community goals through effective volunteer involvement.
The Credentialing Process
A two-part measurement methodology has been designed to demonstrate a candidate's knowledge and application of the core competencies.  This is a self-study process, requiring no travel or special classes.
Part I: Portfolio
: 500 words (a personal reflection on beliefs and values related to Volunteer Resources Management)Philosophy Statement
: 1,500 words (a description of activities and experience focused on three of the core competencies)Management Narrative
Both pieces are written based on the candidate's experience within the field (i.e. observations, actions, insights, lessons learned) rather than on presenting information from textbooks or classes. The Philosophy Statement and Management Narrative must be submitted at the same time and are then subject to a peer review process.
Part II: Multiple Choice Examination
The test is made up of 80 questions documented to the CVA primary references. It is a two-hour proctored examination, offered once a year in May.  Candidates take the exam via the internet, using a computer of their choice in their own community.
Once registered, CVA candidates may start the process with either the portfolio or the examination. However, they are required to sit for the exam in May.  Both the portfolio and the exam must be completed by December 31.
Eligibility
Individuals wishing to become credentialed must meet these requirements in order to register as a candidate:
Minimum of the equivalent of three years of full-time experience related to volunteer resources management. This experience can be a combination of several part-time positions, and can include both salaried and non-salaried roles.
Minimum of 30 percent of current position related to volunteer resources management.
Two letters of professional recommendation from supervisors or colleagues, verifying the candidate's activity in the field and his/her appropriateness as a candidate for this credential.
