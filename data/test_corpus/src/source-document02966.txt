Sterilisation:
Used Tattoo equipment is placed in a covered ultrasonic cleaner for 30 minutes of vibration cleaning.
The ultrasonic is only run with the lid on to avoid sending pathogens airborne.
Equipment is then scrubbed and rinsed under fresh running water.
Next, the equipment is air dried.
Each piece is then placed in to a serialization pouch, sealed and labeled if applicable.
After bagging, tools are arranged properly on an autoclave tray and placed in the autoclave along with a test strip to ensure the clave is operating properly.
The autoclave runs a 40-minute cycle @ 134 centigrade and 25 pounds of pressure.
After claving, the sealed packages are air dried again and then stored for future use.
IMPORTANT: Needles are sterilised and pre-packed , they are used once, then destroyed, as they cannot and will not be reused.
Sterility is paramount in this business and we assure all our customers the highest standards.
