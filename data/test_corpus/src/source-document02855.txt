BART-SFO Extension Aerial Wye Structure
San Francisco, California> Bart-SFO Extension Transit Home
The Aerial Way Structure is an integral component of the $1.48 billion BART San Francisco Airport Extension Project, one of four Federal Transit Administration (FTA) sponsored design-build turnkey demonstration transit projects. Designed using a state-of-the-art analysis to meet the most stringent seismic standards, and built using innovative techniques that enabled construction in a wetlands area, the aerial wye is a sleek, new, cast-in-place elevated track structure that connects with the Airport constructed Highway 101 overpass trackway to bring Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) service directly to the San Francisco International Airport.
The structure, called the aerial wye, is composed of two legs that carry BART trains both north and south, to and from the airport trackway. The two legs have a total of 46 spans. The spans are 80 feet long and the columns are up to 60 feet high. The north split aerial leg is 2,240 feet long with a minimum radius of 1,150 feet and the south let is 1,440 feet long with a minimum radius of 600 feet. The complexity of the structure as well as its location, two and one quarter miles from an active seismic area, the San Andreas Fault, presented significant design challenges.
The designers of the structure used a “non-linear 3D time history analysis”—the most current seismic analysis technique available—to achieve the District’s objective of minimal structural distress resulting from a “maximum credible” seismic event. Although BART seismic requirements have always been stringent, the “maximum credible” seismic standard was adopted after the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989.
To meet the challenges of construction in the environmentally sensitive “West of Bayshore” area where the project is located, the project team developed special construction techniques that prevented any negative impact to the habitat of one endangered and one threatened species, the San Francisco Garter Snake and the California Red-Legged from respectively. The erection of exclusion fencing kept the endangered and threatened species out of the work areas and the construction of a temporary steel and timber trestle to support heavy equipment during construction was key to minimizing disturbance to the ground. The trestle provided all access for construction. After the pile caps were cast, the support for the girders was located entirely on top of the pile caps. After the girder concrete had cured, the form supports were lowered back onto the trestle and removed. Then the trestle was removed.Creativity
Environmental monitoring programs also safeguarded the endangered species. Additionally, the contractor was not permitted to use any mechanized equipment to clear the area, and had to hand clear vegetation using non-mechanized tools.
 
In the aftermath of Loma Prieta, BART functioned as a lifeline for the Bay Area when the Bay Bridge linking the East Bay with San Francisco and the West Bay was significantly damaged. The importance of keeping BART operational after any potential future earthquake became apparent. Since earthquakes larger than the Loma Prieta are anticipated in the Bay Area, BART decided to adopt a standard that would withstand, with minimal damage, even the maximum credible earthquake that could occur.Transferability
The techniques used by the project team to design for the most stringent active seismic zone requirements as well as to develop a construction method for building in wetlands can be easily applied to other structures facing similar challenges.
Since the BART aerial wye is highly visible, its appearance is very important. Travelers on Highway 101 and airport- and BART-users all pass the new structure that brings service to and from the airport from the BART main line. Designed as a multi-cell cast-in-place concrete box girder section, the structure is a graceful combination of horizontal and vertical curves supported on variable height columns with piles anchored below the Bay mud.Aesthetics
With its long life, and low maintenance compared with steel, concrete was the natural choice for this affordable and beautiful aerial structure.Economics
The structure connects BART to the airport, with split tracks that transport passengers out of the airport, north to San Francisco, and south to the Millbrae Intermodal Station. Using the innovative trestle technique demonstrates that important concrete structures can be built with minimum disturbance to the environment. Total cost of the Aerial Wye Structure portion of the BART project is approximately $14 million.Functionality
