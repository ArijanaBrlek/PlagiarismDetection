6 halves slow roasted quinces
500g ready made puff pastry
5 pumps stirred into…NoMU Vanilla Paste,
200ml double cream
I know this does not fit into our pasta theme for month, but after shooting last month's mailer we had left over quinces so decided to make quince tarte tatin for a dinner party. They were just too delicious not to share the recipe with you!
Quince tarte tatin
Follow the same method for slow roasting the quinces in last month’s mailer, the only difference is to peel the quinces before roasting them. Very lightly flour and roll out a sheet of puff pastry. Using a large cookie cutter or small saucer, cut circles about 10cm in diameter out of ready made puff pastry.
Lightly butter a large 6-muffin tray. Pour 2 tbsp of quince syrup into the bottom of all the muffin moulds. Place the quince cut-side down onto the syrup. Cover the quince halves with the puff pastry circles, carefully tucking the pastry all the way down the sides of the quinces.
If your quinces are cool enough to handle, you may find it easier to use your hands shape the puff pastry around the quince, but leaving the cut side exposed before inverting the quince into the muffin mould and onto the syrup.
Make sure the puff pastry is nice and snug around each quince! Repeat as necessary. Place in a preheated oven of 200°C for 20 minutes. When the puff pastry has risen and is golden brown, remove the muffin tray from the oven and allow to stand for 2 minutes.
Then using a spoon simply lift the tarte tatin’s out of their moulds and onto individual dessert bowls. Spoon extra syrup around the tarte tatin and serves with vanilla cream.
Serves 6.
