Framed by mountains, Lake Las Vegas is a 320-acre man made jewel, surrounded by a 2,600-acre Mediterranean-style golf and residential village that beckons Las Vegas visitors with a charming brand of luxury otherwise unknown in these parts. Carved out of rough-hewn hills and desert wash, Lake Las Vegas is the latest gathering spot along a desert water supply that was used as an ancient trade route by Native Americans, a rest stop for travelers along the Spanish Trail and as farmland by early Nevada settlers. Just 17 miles from the famed Las Vegas strip, this lake community has become a welcoming oasis where boat masts sway in a marina, shops and restaurants dot the shoreline and dwellings washed in the sun-drenched colors of the Mediterranean create panoramic views for guests of all ages.
