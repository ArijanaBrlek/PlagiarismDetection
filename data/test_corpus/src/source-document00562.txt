Northwest Michigan's Transition to the Knowledge Economy
 
 
Northwest Michigan's Transition to the Knowledge Economy Workshop was held on January 27, 2009 in Traverse City. Over 130 people gathered at the Hagerty Conference Center to better understand how Northwest Michigan can compete in the new, global economy.
The workshop provided a Knowledge Economy orientation and introduced two new indicator projects that are in process for the region.
Participants heard from leaders in three categories--agriculture, energy, and manufacturing--about the opportunities and challenges each industry faces in the knowledge economy.
