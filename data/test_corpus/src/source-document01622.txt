Dr. Jerry Sevick, W2FMI on Array Solutions Un-Uns and Baluns
I would like to express my thanks to Jay Terleski, WX0B for continuing the advancement of the transmission line transformer.We have become somewhat of co-workers, sharing information back and forth about how these efficient devices work in the HF, MF, and VHF parts of spectrum.He has done some recent experiments on new ferrite cores and found that by reducing the number of turns the actual potential difference on each turn is greater which increased the core loss. This means that the losses in these transmission line transformers are voltage dependant and not flux related.
The Array Solutions baluns use the J. Reisert, W1JR technique which was developed in 1978.  As I have previously documented in my published books the Reisert balun which uses a low permeability toroid core and a small but high powered transmission line is one of the most efficient and elegant baluns ever devised.  This is due to the following: 
span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">        An efficient low-loss ferrite is used.
span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">        The balun has sufficient choking reactance for the various low-frequency requirements, in the Array Solutions versions you can chose them.
span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">        The characteristic impedance of the coiled transmission line was the same as that of the feedline, eliminating the extra transformer action of a length of transmission line with different characteristic impedance.
span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">        The balun is a form of Guanella two-conductor 1:1 balun, which is not prone to core flux and, hence, saturations and the generation of spurious frequencies.
span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">        It is also not susceptible to mismatched and unbalanced loads as are the Turrin and oltagebaluns. 
The use of a crossover winding in the Reisert balun has virtually NO effect up to 100 MHz, which was the limit of my equipment. The idea that the crossover winding introduces stray capacitances is not evident, and in the Array Solutions design it is proven to be a non-factor.  We don see any affect of the crossover winding or inter-capacitance problems from the windings themselves, since they are so carefully arranged in this balun and not cramble wound  But the crossover winding does allow a convenient way to allow Array Solutions to dress the cable to the output bolts on the opposite end from the connector, and I suspect that is why he has chosen to use this technique.   This is an excellent implementation of the W1JR design. 
Not related to the engineering of this balun is the Nema 4X sealed box that is used.  What a perfect solution to keep moisture out of the balun.  You can take the cover off and review the design.  They have nothing to hide inside this well made product.
