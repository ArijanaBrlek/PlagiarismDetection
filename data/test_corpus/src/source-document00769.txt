  All of our fence styles come in two varieties.  Those which are intended to be set in the ground using concrete and those which are going to be fastened to a concrete pad or deck.  Standard installation uses posts which are slightly longer for cementing in the ground, but all styles have a shorter post option which is used when you need to attach the fence posts to a concrete pad, deck or retaining wall.What installation method do I want to use?
  A section is defined as the material that completes the fence between posts.  So typically a "section" of fence would be 2 rails and the pickets.  A section price does not include posts or post caps.  So to figure your material list you would divide your total footage - including gates if using kits - by the width of the section.  If you do not need a full section of fence, you can order the exact number of each item needed from the price form which contains optional/extra material.  For estimate purposes, round up to the nearest full fence section.How many sections are needed?
