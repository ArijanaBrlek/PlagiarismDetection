Transliteration
Transliteration of the Hindi words
Hindi and Sanskrit alphabet is the same and its every consonant and vowel has very precise pronunciation which is not found in the English language (or any other language of the world). This is the reason that the exact pronunciation of Hindi or Sanskrit words cannot be transliterated into English. (Article 30)
In the English language all the words (even the very simple words like, a, an, the, one and two) have a history of how they originated from proto-Germanic, Latin, Greek, Romance languages or Old English, and then how they took the modern shape. During that period their spelling and pronunciation and also their meaning were changed a number of times (pp. 184-192). Every letter of English language has a sound which further changes according to the style of the pronunciation of a particular word. Thus, sometimes a letter has more than one sound, and sometimes more than one letter has the same sound. For example: In the words at and itten, and both have the same sound; in the word prt, has both sounds, short and long ; in the words fnsh, fnte and lter, is pronounced differently ; in the words enter and entene, and both have the same sound; and in the words fr, frk and frquency, long is written in three styles, , , and ; and so on. Thus, the English letters do not have a fixed, precise sound that could be used in all the situations, whereas the Hindi and Sanskrit letters have a definite and precise sound.ckck
