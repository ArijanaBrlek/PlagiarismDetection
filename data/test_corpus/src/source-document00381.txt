The real estate market in America has changed more in the past year than I believe it changed during the prior 10 years combined.  The number of ready, willing and capable buyers today is at the lowest level I have seen while the number of homeowners who truly need to sell their homes is approaching record levels.  This translates into fewer buyers buying while a greater number of homes remain on the market unsold.  
Years ago many real estate professionals bought into a concept that I like to call the real estate K'Mart pricing method.  Instead of pricing a home at $200,000 they would price it as $199,900 because they thought it sounded better.  The real estate landscape has since changed dramatically and with the addition of consumer friendly online MLS systems and the real estate listing websites that allow consumers to search for homes...that same $199,900 listing price will now eliminate 50% of your buyers instantly and here's why:
$199,900 is an odd number price and home buyers do not generally search for anything other than even number prices such as $100,000, $125,000, 150,000, $175,000, $200,000, $225,000, $250,000, $275,000, $300,000 and so on.
A home priced at $199,900 will only show up on a search of $150,000 to $200,000 and it will be invisible to anyone looking at $200,001 or higher.  
When your home is priced at $199,900 it won't show up when a buyer is searching for homes priced at $200,000 to $250,000 and it won't show up when they are searching for homes that are priced between $200,000 to $300,000.
By pricing your home at $200,000 you will instantly connect both price ranges together and this is where the name "Price Bridging" comes from.  The $200,000 listing price can quickly and effectively double the number of buyers who will be exposed to your home.
This price bridging method can be beneficial to you regardless if your home is valued at $50,000 or $500,000.  If you are interested in obtaining the maximum exposure for your Knox County Ohio home we are only a phone call away.

The Apple Valley Lake community in Knox County Ohio saw a slight reduction in homes sales in January 2009.  As of today and according to the Knox County MLS there were only 2 residential homes that sold in January which was down from 3 sales in January 2008.  This slower sales activity was not a huge surprise due to the more severe weather we have experienced this year. 
If you are in the market to purchase an Apple Valley home the timing is ideal to be able to negotiate a favorable deal.  Home prices are more affordable than in years past and fixed rate mortgages are nearing a 40 year low so your purchase price and monthly payments will be greatly reduced.  If you are interested in learning more about buying feel free to contact us by phone at (740) 397-7800 or e-mail us anytime.  If you are interested in working with us to purchase an Apple Valley home in the future you should take advantage of our   All you need to do is click the link above and register and our system will search the Knox County Multiple Listing Service and send you the available listings by e-mail.  Apple Valley Listings By E-mail.
The Apple Valley Lake housing market is traditionally slower until early spring.  If you are considering selling your current Apple Valley home we highly recommend that you schedule an appointment to meet with us in February or March so that you can be prepared before other competing Apple Valley property owners list their homes.  Coming onto the market just one month earlier than other competing homes can give you and your home a huge advantage and get your home sold before other competing homes enter the market.

January 2009 was a slower month for Mount Vernon Ohio home sales activity.  As of January 31st, 2009 the Knox County MLS had only reported 8 residential homes sales in the Mount Vernon Ohio school district so far this year.  Last year during the same time period the Knox County MLS reported 14 homes sales. This means that 2009 saw roughly a 40% decrease in home sales activity during the first month of year.  This certainly doesn't mean that prices are down by 40% but that in 2009 there were simply fewer homes sales.
Each month I spend a substantial amount of time after business hours researching the market activity that is reported to the Knox County Multiple Listing Service.  This month it is very obvious why the home sales are down and that is that many of the January home sales were bank owned foreclosure listings.  You might be asking yourself why this would make the overall home sale numbers lower and the answer is banks do not need to buy a replacement home when they sell their repo listings.  When the homeowner successfully sells their current home they generally replace it with another home purchase essentially accounting for 2 sales or transactions.  When we sell a bank owned foreclosure the bank is not taking their money and buying another home.  This is a very big part of the January 2009 sales drop in Mount Vernon, Ohio.
This may sound like bad news but in reality it isn't bad news at all.  The slow down is simply a small ripple in the Mount Vernon Ohio real estate market which I believe will begin to smooth out in months to come.  Remember that all real estate activity goes in cycles and it's good to move some of the Mount Vernon Ohio  foreclosures so that in the more active months to come many of those Mount Vernon bank owned listings will already be sold when the spring market warms up.  This is important because it can be difficult for an average homeowner to be able to compete financially with HUD foreclosure or a bank who simply needs to get their non performing asset off their books.
I created some special real estate links that will take you directly to homes, condos and bank owned listings for sale that are located in and around Mount Vernon and Knox County Ohio
