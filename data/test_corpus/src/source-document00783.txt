To safeguard the lives and property of the people using the highway traffic system of Montana through education, service, enforcement and interagency cooperation.
Duties of a Patrol Trooper
Montana Highway Patrol troopers never know what might be in store when their shifts start. They may have to determine what caused a crash and console upset victims. They may apprehend a dangerous criminal, help someone change a flat tire or speak to a group of students about the importance of wearing seatbelts.

patrol Montana's highways to enforce federal, state and local traffic laws
respond to and investigate crashes, crimes, natural disasters and potential safety hazards on and off Montana's roads
apprehend criminals, including those who transport drugs
provide humanitarian aid to citizens
give presentations related to traffic and safety, and build positive relations within their community
appear in court to assist in prosecuting offenders
inspect school buses to ensure that they comply with state and federal laws relating to passenger safety
