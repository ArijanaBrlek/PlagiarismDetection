Drawing upon the broad science foundation of the Laboratory including chemistry, catalysis and materials science, we are exploring how to use today's domestic resources more cleanly and efficiently. These nearer-term innovations will serve as an "energy bridge" to tomorrow's advanced energy systems, which will be built upon a renewable, nuclear and hydrogen energy base. Our contributions focus on increasing the energy capacity in the United States and reducing the nation's dependence on imported oil. We will provide the science, technology and leadership to
Enable economically and environmentally sustainable conversion of domestic hydrocarbons to gases, liquid fuels, electricity and chemicals.
Improve grid reliability and productivity
Accelerate safe and economic expansion of nuclear power
Increase the efficiency of powering vehicles and buildings
Our projects focus on technological advancements in areas such as gasification, carbon management, biobased products, real-time grid monitoring, solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen storage, materials for radioactive environments, nuclear reactor licensing, next-generation lighting, auto emissions, and energy smart buildings.
Overall, ESTD creates scientific understanding and technology solutions for public and private sectors resulting in
