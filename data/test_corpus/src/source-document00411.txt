History of the World Series of Poker
As legend has it, the idea for the World Series of Poker has its genesis in a 1949 high-stakes poker tournament between Nicholas 'Nick the Greek' Dandolos and Johnny Moss which was arranged by Benny Binion. The tournament was held before a public audience and lasted five months. Dandolos and Moss went back and forth playing a variety of poker games. Ultimately Moss won all the money (an estimated $2 million).
In 1970, Benny Binion took this idea a step further and held another poker tournament, called it the World Series of Poker, and invited many of the top poker players of the day. The poker tournament champion was decided by a popular vote and Johnny Moss prevailed again.
The next year, 1971, the World Series of Poker was changed to an elimination format. The player left standing at the end with all of the chips was Johnny Moss, again World Champion. In 1972, Thomas 'Amarillo Slim' Preston won the tournament.
Since then, the World Series of Poker has had its share of drama and excitement.  In a story that should give every poker player hope, Jack Strauss came back to win one year after having lost all but one chip of his stake early in the poker tournament.  Proving that it is never too late to be great again, Stu Ungar picked up his third win after spending 17 years mostly out of competition.
One of the leading money winners in the World Series of Poker has been T. J. Cloutier.  Over the years, he has finished in the money in over 30 WSOP poker game events.  He has also won five first place WSOP gold bracelets in various events.  In the main Championship event of Texas Holdem, he has finished twice in second-place, and once each in third place and fifth place.
Billy Baxter, one of the other big names in poker, dominated the deuce-to-seven draw poker WSOP tournament for many years, with five first place finishes and two second place finishes.
Many other household poker names have graced the World Series of Poker over the years.  Names such as Mickey Appleman, Bobby Baldwin, Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan, Johnny Moss, and "Amarillo Slim" Preston.
