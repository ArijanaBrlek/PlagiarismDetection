Life in Old Virginia
By James J. McDonald Published by the Old Virginia Publishing Company, Inc., Norfolk, Va., 1907
FOREWORD
When I am old and feeble, And cannot work any more, Then carry me back to Old Virginia, To Old Virginia's shore.
This sentiment doubtless was most forcibly expressed in the year 1907, during which there was witnessed an international celebration of the first permanent settlement of the English speaking people upon the American continent.
In aid of this event the Congress of the United States passed an Act approved March 3, 1905, entitled "An Act to provide for celebrating the birth of the American Nation, the first permanent settlement of English speaking people on the Western hemisphere, by the holding of an international naval, marine and military celebration in the vicinity of Jamestown in the waters of Hampton Roads, in the State of Virginia, to provide for the suitable and permanent Commemoration of said event and to authorize an appropriation in aid thereof and for other purposes."
The Act authorized the President of the United States to make public proclamation of this celebration, " inviting foreign nations to participate by the sending of their naval and such representatives of their military organizations as may be proper."
The proclamation fixed the time of the beginning of the celebration on May 13, and ending not later than November 1, 1907.
The purpose of this boob is to give a brief history of the efforts of the English to establish permanent settlements in Virginia, and to follow with interesting stories of the life and customs of the people inhabiting particularly that part of Old Virginia, known as the " Tidewater " section where American civilization began its first struggles for existence amid the forests of a new world whose only occupants then were wild beasts and savage men.
It was the fortune of the writer to pass more than twenty five years of his life in Eastern Virginia, beginning at the close of that great struggle-the War between the States--when there yet existed many of the customs and manners inherited from the forefathers of the quiet and orderly people inhabiting that section. By means of official and social intercourse with all classes of the citizens of Tidewater Virginia the writer is indebted for much of the interesting and amusing data herein submitted to the reader.
The book also contains the names of all the counties with date of formation and a valuable appendix giving a list with short biographical sketches of all the governors of Virginia.
This volume is, therefore, intended as a reference book as well as for general reading. Many of the narratives may appear disconnected, but the author wishes it understood that his purpose has been not to give a connected history but to present those facts of Virginia relating especially to the life and customs which are fast disappearing and of which there has been no chronicler.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
CHAPTER, I
The Domain of Virginia
The historian Burke wrote: "A correct history of Virginia would be the history of North America itself, a portion of the globe, which enjoying the invaluable privilege of self government, promises to eclipse the glory of Rome and Athens. In this part of the American Continent the first permanent establishment was farmed by the English, and it is here we must look for those ancient documents and materials, whose discovery will throw light on the history of the other States."
Virginia, now a South Atlantic State, and one of the original thirteen States to form the Union, was named in honor of Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen, and originally comprised all the territory north of Florida extending "from sea to sea,"across this continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. What is now left of this immense territory, bearing the honored name of Virginia, lies between the parallels of 30° 31' and 30° 27' North; and longitude 75° 13' and 83° 37' West, containing a gross area of 42,450 square miles, or 27,168,000 acres; 40,125 square miles of which is land surface, and 2,325 square miles of water surface. It contains 100 counties, which are grouped into sip grand divisions, as follows:
(1) Tidewater Virginia; (2) Middle Virginia; (3) Piedmont, Virginia; (4) The Valley of Virginia; (5) The Blue Ridge, and (6) Appalachia.
The first dividing of the original territory named Virginia was by James I of England, who on April 10, 1606, granted a charter to the "South Virginia Company "of London, commonly called the "London Company,"and to the "North Virginia Company,"of Plymouth. When this charter was granted, the Crown of England claimed the whole of North America called "Virginia," between 34° and 45° north latitude under the name of Virginia, by right of discovery. It was conceded that Spain occupied all south of 34°-commonly called Florida-and to France was conceded all north of 45°. To the London Company was granted the territory between 34° and 41° north latitude, running from ocean to ocean.
The northern limits of Virginia were afterwards curtailed by grants to Lord Baltimore in 1631 and to William Penn in 1681, and the southern limits by a grant to the Proprietors of the Carolinas by charter in 1663. The next division of Virginia's territory was by deed of cession through her delegates in the Continental Congress, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Hardy,-Arthur Lee, and James Monroe on March 1, 1784.
When the definite treaty of peace with Great Britain was made, September 3, 1783, the general government had no lands in its possession, though the States had premised to cede their western lands. All the territory included in that treaty was then claimed by some one or other of the several States. It was through the cessions of these several States which claimed the lands that the United States government derived title to what is known as public lands, or "public domain." Subsequently both the public and national domain vas acquired and added to by the general government by purchase, treaty and annexation from France, Spain, Texas, and Russia., during several respective periods. The "national domain"is the total area, land and water, embraced within the boundaries of the United States of America. The United States government also holds dominion over the Sandwich Islands, some parts of the West Indies, and the Philippine Islands, all of which are outside the limits of the main lands of North America.
Prior to 1781, six only of the original thirteen States, viz., New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware had their present defined boundaries, while the remaining seven States, claimed some lands to the west. The States with inexact boundaries ceded their claims to the lands west of their present limits to the general Government.
The total actual cessions of these seven States, viz: Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, for public domain, were 404,956 square miles, or 259,171,840 acres. Of this amount Virginia ceded 195,431,680 acres, the most valuable gift ever recorded in the history of this nation. Hence her right to the honored title of " The Mother of States."
On March 1, 1784, Virginia, through her delegates in the Continental Congress completed the act of ceding all the territory west of the State of Pennsylvania and northwest of the river Ohio below the forty-first parallel of north latitude, which was hers by charter right. She had an additional claim to the western territory extending north from the forty first parallel north latitude to Lakes Michigan and Huron, now in Illinois and Michigan, and northward, by reason of . conquest and occupancy during the Revolutionary War by her State troops under General George Rogers Clark.
The present area of the State of Kentucky, 40,400 square miles, was a "District"of Virginia, lying south of the Ohio River, and was allowed to be organized into a State in 1792.
The extent of the territory Virginia gave to the Union was :
The State of Ohio (excepting the Western Reserve and Fire-lands claimed by the State of Connecticut and lands now in Michigan)
39,364 sq. miles
The State of Illinois
55,414 sq. miles
She also ceded lands claimed by the State of Connecticut and Massacusetts under their crown charters, as well as by the United States under the definite treaty of peace with Great Britian of 1783:
In Michigan
In Minnesota, east of Mississippi River
26,000 sq. miles
Total (disputed and undisputed) cession by Virginia including Kentucky
305,362 sq. miles
The last slice of territory from Old Virginia was 23,000 square miles, which went to form the State of West Virginia, by an Act of Congress, December 31, 1862, which took effect June 9, 1863.taken
CHAPTER II
The Peninsulas of Tidewater Virginia
The region which the colonists first selected for settlement is known as "Tidewater Virginia."It was there that the first great struggle of the white race was begun with the aboriginal inhabitants for the purpose of establishing a permanent abiding home in a new world, many years before the pilgrim Fathers "first sighted Plymouth Rock. The howling of the wild beasts of the forest, the war whoop of the equally wild man and the solemn hoot of the midnight owl were the only sounds to greet the ears of the first settler in all the vast territory which now comprises this " Glorious Union of States"The settlement of this region was begun more than two hundred years before the first railroad was built upon this planet. There were then no public highways, but only here and there an Indian trail to point the new comer through the wide wilderness of America.
This region of America is full of the romances and the realities of the experiences of the early years of the first permanent settlement of the English speaking people on this Continent. Here it was for the first time that the stroke of the axe of the English laid prostrate the standing giants of the forests of the new world, and thereby awakened nature from its slumbers and sounded new and alarming echoes throughout the lands christened "Virginia "by a Virgin Queen of the Old World. It was here that the beasts of the wild woods, and the fowls of the air first were shocked to death by the burst of the rifle's discharge, and the superstitious natives thus forced to believe that the new comers were born not of woman but sent armed from the skies with a demon of destruction which no other earthly power possessed. It was there the first thoughts of human freedom were given birth and voice to cheer mankind. The "cradle of liberty for this Continent "was first tenanted and rocked there to lull the cries of the "child of freedom."It was there the first truly representative legislative body of the people assembled on this continent. The first sound of praise and thanksgiving ever uttered from a house of worship dedicated to God, in the new found world, vibrated the air of Tidewater Virginia, and wafted its way to the throne of Grace, bespeaking the coming of a new race. It was at Jamestown that the first church was built within the territory which later comprised the thirteen original States. It was in that section that Pocahontas, the untutored daughter of a savage chief, though born in the primeval forest, first taught the world that "pity and mercy "are the inherent qualities of womankind, and are not confined to the cultured princesses of the stately palaces of civilization.in the language of this nation
It was here that the first slave set foot upon the mainland of this continent. Here it was that the white man first exercised the right of suffrage, and that trial by jury was first granted. The first free school on this continent was started in this section. The first manufactures of this continent were begun here, and were the first of such products sent from the newly found continent to the Old World.
Tidewater Virginia has produced more eminent and illustrious men of America than any other section of the same extent within the boundaries of this nation. Its history has inspired the orator, enthused the soldier, and awakened in the statesman suggestions of wisdom, the benefits of which this nation is now the recipient.
Its soil is sprinkled with the blood of the patriots of the Revolution in their successful battling at Yorktown, which cheered a weak people in their mighty struggle for final freedom. The marks of many heroic battles for the perpetuation of the "Old Union of States,"or a disunited nation and a « New Confederacy,"are yet in plain view in many parts of section of Virginia, bearing evidence of the willing sacrifices which all Americans will make in defense of a principle.
Tidewater Virginia begins at a gap in the Atlantic Ocean shores of Virginia, known as the " Capes of the Chesapeake."This gap forms an entrance more than twelve miles in width, and within a short distance inland from its mouth it broadens into a magnificent stream, in some places nearly forty miles wide, and is known as the Chesapeake Bay. The salt waters which flow from the Atlantic Ocean into this big bay, through its capacious mouth, spread out and form long rivers, such as the James, Rappahannock, and Potomac, and shorter streams as the York, Piankatank, Yeocomico, Coan, Wicomico, Nomini and others too numerous to mention, and inlets, creeks, and coves innumerable. The Chesapeake Bay also sends its flood of waters to the shores of Maryland, where they form innumerable streams throughout that State.
Tidewater Virginia is divided into nine natural subdivisions, or large (primary) peninsulas, each of which contains many small (subordinate) peninsulas, no part of which is elevated more than 150 feet above sea level.
The large peninsulas are grouped as follows 1. "The Eastern Shore Peninsula,"consisting of two counties:
Northampton and Accomac. The first was named in honor of the Earl of Northampton; the latter was named after an Indian tribe inhabiting that section. Northampton and Accomac were twice named. The territory composing the Eastern Shore of Virginia was first named Accawmake. Under this name it was made one of the eight original shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, and continued under the name of Accawmake until 1642, when it was changed to Northampton. In 1672 Accomac was formed from its upper part, and the lower part retained the name of Northampton. This peninsula begins on the Atlantic coast at Cape Charles, and extends along the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay to the Maryland line. It includes the land across to the Atlantic coast.
2. The "Norfolk Peninsula "consisting of two counties Princess Anne, formed in 1691, from Lower Norfolk, named in honor of Queen Anne.
Norfolk, formed in 1691, from part of Lower Norfolk, named in honor of Duke of Norfolk.
This peninsula begins on the Atlantic coast at the North Carolina line, extending inland around Cape Henry to the mouth of James River.
3. The "Southside Peninsula "containing seven counties Nansemond was formed in 1639 from Upper Norfolk, and named Nansimun after an Indian tribe. In 1645 it was changed to Nansemond.
Isle of Wight, one of the original eight shires formed in 1634, and known originally as Warrasquake. In 1637 it was named in honor of a place in England.
Southampton, formed in 1684, from Isle of Wight, named in honor of Earl of Southampton.
Sussex, formed in 1753 from Surrey County, named in honor of Lord Sussex.
Surrey, formed in 1652 from James City County, named in honor of Lord Surrey.
Prince George, formed in 1702 from Charles City County, named in honor of Prince George, afterwards King George II.
Chesterfield, formed in 1748, from Henrico, named in honor of P. D. Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield.
This peninsula is situated on the south side of the James River, beginning at its mouth, and extending to "the falls "of that river which flows between Chesterfield and Henrico counties.
4. The "Richmond,"or "Chickahominy "Peninsula, containing two counties:
Charles City County, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, named in honor of Charles the First.
Henrico, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, named in honor of Henry, Prince of Wales.
This peninsula is on the north side of the James, and between that river and the Chickahominy. It begins at the mouth of the Chickahominy where that stream empties into the James, and extends to "the falls"of the latter river, which flows between Henrico and Chesterfield counties.
5. The next peninsula is known as "The Peninsula,"containing six counties:
Elizabeth City County, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, named in honor of queen Elizabeth.
Warwick, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, then called Warwick River, changed to Warwick in 1642, named in honor of Warwick in England.
York, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, then called Charles River, changed to York in 1642, named in honor of Duke of York.
James City County, one of the original eight shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634, named in honor of King James I.
New Kent, formed in 1654, from York, named in honor of. Kent in England.
Hanover, formed in 1720, from Now Dent, named in honor of George I, King of Hanover as well as England.
This peninsula begins at Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay, its southern boundary, thence up the James River to mouth of Chickahominy, where this stream empties into the latter river, thence up the northern bank of Chickahominy. Its eastern and northern boundary is the whole length of the south side of York River, thence up the Pamunkey, between that river and Chickahominy.
6. The "Gloucester Peninsula,"containing three counties:
Gloucester, formed in 1651 from a part of York, named in honor of Duke of Gloucester.
Mathews, formed in 1790, from part of Gloucester, named in honor of Governor Mathews. This county is a peninsula extending into the Chesapeake Bay, and united to the main land by a narrow neck of land. Its lands are so nearly on a dead level that there are no streams of fresh water in the county. The grist mills are run by wind or tide power.running
King and Queen County, formed in 1691, from New Kent, named in honor of King William and Queen Mary.
This peninsula lies between the York and Piankatank Rivers and Chesapeake Bay:
The "King William "or "Pamunkey Peninsula,"containing two counties:
King William, formed in 1701, from King and Queen, named in honor of William III. It lies between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers.
Caroline, formed in 1727 in the language of the act of the House of Burgess, "On the heads of Essex, King and Queen, and King William Counties,"named in honor of Princess Caroline Elizabeth. It lies between the North Anna and Rappahannock Rivers.
8. The "Middlesex Peninsula,"containing two counties:
Middlesex, formed in 1675, from Lancaster, named in honor of Middlesex in England.
Essex, formed in 1692, from part of "Old Rappahannock", named in honor of Earl of Essex.
Old Rappahannock County was formed in December, 1656, from part of Lancaster County. In the language of the ;t of Assembly: "The upper part of Mr. Bennetts land knowne by the name of Naemhock on the south side of the eastermost branch of Moratticock Creeke, on the north side the river be the lowermost bounds of the upper county. The lower county to retaine the name of Lancaster and the upper county to be named Rappahannock."
The territory embraced within what was termed in the act as the "Upper County"included Richmond County, on the north side of Rappahannock River, and Essex County on the south side of same river.
9. The "Northern Neck of Virginia,"now containing five counties:
Lancaster, formed in 1651, from Northumberland, named in honor of Lancaster in England.
Northumberland County, originally called Chickcoun, adjoining n Lancaster on the Chesapeake Bay. It originally comprised the whole "Neck of land between Rappahannock `and Potomac Rivers."
The date when this county was formed is in doubt; it certainly contained the or north of Rappahannock River, within all the territory subsequently named "The Northern Neck of Virginia."At what date the first settlement was made there is not known. By an Act of Assembly in June, 1642, it was felony to settle outside of certain limits without permission of the governor and council. It provided "That the Rappahannock River should remain unseated for divers reasons therein contained, notwithstanding it should and might be lawful for all persons to assume grants for lands there,"etc. A similar act to that of June, 1642 was passed in 1647, but in October, 1648, it was reviation of Secacaconies, an Indian tribe once located on that stream. The first public official announcement of the name of Northumberland occurs in the 9th Act of Assembly, February, 1644-5, providing for the erection of three forts, viz.: one at "Pamunkey "(Nest Point), named Fort Royal, one at the "Falls of James River"(Richmond), named Fort Charles, and the third on the ridge at "Chicquohominie '' (near Bottoms Bridge), named Fort James, as follows: And be it explained and confirmed by the authorities that the associating counties on the south side of the river are hereby to contribute towards the maintainance of the (Indian) War on that side, without any expectation of any contribution from the side, and so likewise on the by themselves including Northampton and Northumberland."From the above one would conclude it had been made a county at, or to 1644, but the writers of the early period, except Hening, were content with their own knowledge that Northumberland was but a "Plantation "in 1644-45. The earliest court records now in the clerk's office of that county are dated 1652. Some of the court records were burned many years ago, therefore it is not known what dates the records bore which were destroyed. The old books are bound with oak board backs, covered with heavy leather. They contain much of interest in the matter of curious wills, and surprising items relating to the sentences imposed by the courts for offenses (stated in the plainest words of the English language), which under the present day ruling of the courts would meet with less rigorous punishment.first settlementthe whitesnorthnorth sideprior
Richmond County, formed in 1692, from old Rappahannock, named in honor of Duke of Richmond.
Westmoreland County, formed in 1653, from Northumberland, named after Westmoreland in England. The first mention of Westmoreland County is in an Act of Assembly of July, 1653, by which "It is ordered that the bounds of the County of Westmoreland be as follows, via.: from Machoactoke River, where Mr. Cole liven, and so upwards to the falls of the great river Pawtomake, above Nescostines towne."Nescostines towne referred to was probably a settlement of Indians at the place now known as "Anacostia,"on the Eastern Branch, now in the District of Columbia. Westmoreland County under this Act extended to "the falls of the Potomac,"which would include the territory now comprising the counties of King George, Stafford, Prince William, Fairfax and Alexandria.
King George County, formed in 1720, from Richmond County, named in honor of grog George I.
These five counties are formed within a peninsula, the southern and eastern boundaries being the mouths of the Rappahannock, and Potomac rivers.
Many persons include the County of Stafford in the present "Northern Neck of Virginia."To include this county would bring the Northern Neck opposite to the City of Fredericksburg, and beyond it to include the limits of the whole county. The city of Fredericksburg is in Spotsylvania County, and lies on the southern banks of the Rappahannock, at the "falls "of that river-the head of tidewater of that stream.
The original "Northern Neck of Virginia"distinguishes this peninsula as being once the seat of the largest individual land holdings ever in America. In 1661, Charles II, of England made a grant of land in America to Lord Hopton and others, which included: "All that entire tract, territory and parcel of land, lying and being in America, and bounded by and within the of the rivers Tappahannock alias Rappahannock, and Quiriough alias Potomac rivers, the course of the said rivers as they are commonly called and known by the inhabitants, and description of their parts and Chesapeake Bay."This was sold by the original patentees to Lord Culpeper in 1683, and later was confirmed to him by letters patent in the fourth year of the reign of James II, of England. The elder-Thomas 5th-Lord Fairfax, married the only daughter of Lord Culpeper. These lands descended to the son by this marriage-Lord Thomas Fairfax, Sixth Baron of Cambridge. He came to Virginia in 1739 to look after thin estate. This immense tract included the territory now comprising the counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond Westmoreland, Prince George, Stafford, Prince William, Fauquier, Fairfax, Loudon, Culpeper, Clarke, Madison, Page, Shenandoah and Frederick, in the present limits of the State of Virginia, and Hardy, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley and Jefferson now within the State of West Virginia; the whole estate comprising nearly 6,000,000 acres.headwaters
"It was said that the first grant was only intended to include the territory between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. When Fairfax discovered that the Potomac River headed in the Allegheny Mountains he went to England and instituted his petition in the Court of the Dings Bench for extending his grant into the, Allegheny Mountains, so as to include the territory now composing the counties of Page, Shenandoah, and Frederick, in Virginia, and Hardy, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson, now in West Virginia. A compromise was effected between Fairfax and the Crown, in which it was stipulated that the holders of lands, under what then were called "Kings grants,"were to be quieted in their right of possession. Fairfax, under certain pretexts took it upon him self to grant away large quantities of these Crown granted lands to individuals other than those occupying or claiming them under the Crown grants, and thereby produced numerous lawsuits. His title was disputed on every hand. The northern boundary wan disputed by the Maryland proprietary, and his eastern and southern boundaries were disputed by many settlers upon it. On the Maryland side the question was which of the two head streams of the Potomac was intended to be the northern boundary of Lord Culpeper's purchase in 1683. In Virginia the dispute was concerning the grants to settlers east of the Alleghanies, and also as to which of the two head streams of the Rappahannock was the Fairfax limits: "The Conway " (confluent of the Rapidan), or the Rappahannock, between these being all the land now comprised by the counties of Culpeper, Madison and Rappahannock.
On a petition of Lord Fairfax, the King appointed a " Commission " for running out and marking the limits of his patent. The three Commissioners for the Crown were Colonel William Byrd, of Westover, John Robinson, and John Grymes. Lord Fairfax appointed William Fairfax, William Beverley and Charles Career. In 1746 an expedition of forty gentlemen, amongst whom were Beverley, Lomax, Lewis, Lightfoot, Hedginan, Peter Jefferson, and young George Washington, started from Fredericksburg to survey and define the boundaries of " The Northern Neck of Virginia." This expedition laid the " Fairfax Stone" at the head spring of the Potomac. Lord Fairfax opened an office in the county-Fairfax-which was named in his honor. There he granted out his lands until a few years thereafter when he removed to Frederick County, and settled at a place he called " Greenway Court," twelve or fourteen miles southeast of Winchester, where he led a sort of hermit life, and kept his office during the remainder of his life. He died December 12, 1781, soon after hearing of the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. It is said that as soon as he learned of the capture of Cornwallis and his army, he called his servant to assist him to bed, observing: " It is time for me to die," and he never again left his bed until he was consigned to his tomb. His body was deposited under the Communion table in the then Episcopal church in Winchester.
The lands were granted by Fairfax in fee simple to his tenants, subject to an annual rent of two shillings sterling 'per hundred acres, added to which he required the payment of ten shillings sterling on each fifty acres, which he termed "composition money,"and which was to be paid upon the issuing of the grant. In 1785 the legislature of Virginia passed an Act, in which among other provisions, in relation to the Northern Neck, is the following: "And be it further enacted, that the land owners within the said district of the Northern Neck shall be forever hereafter exonerated and discharged from composition and quitrents, any law, custom or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding:"
The present limits of the Northern Neck of Virginia have earned a far greater distinction than that of its connection with the largest individual proprietorship of lands. Within its borders were born some of the most illustrious men, who were conspicuous in the shaping of the destinies of the American people. Of the seven Presidents of the United States who were born in Virginia, but two of them were born outside of the tidewater section: Thos. Jefferson, born in Albemarle County, and Zachary Taylor, born in Orange County. Of the remaining five Presidents, three were born in the Northern Neck of Virginia-George Washington, and James Monroe, both born in Westmoreland County, and James Madison, born in the adjoining county of King George. The other two PresidentsWilliam Henry Harrison, and John Tyler, were born in Charles City County. The Northern Neck of Virginia is greatly distinguished and honored as the birthplace of "Mary"(Ball), "The Mother of Washington,"born at "Epping Forest,"Lancaster County, in 1707. She died at Mt. Vernon, Fairfax County, August 25, 1789.
Westmoreland County was also the birthplace of the "Lees" "Light Horse Harry Lee,"and others of that family, including General "Robert E. Lee."
`The Northern Neck is the longest of all the peninsulas comprising Tidewater Virginia. It extends from the Chesapeake Bay shores to the head of tidewater, upon the Rappahannock River; a distance of more than 120 miles.
Tidewater Virginia extends beyond the confines of the counties named as being within the herein mentioned. It also includes the five counties on the upper tidewater section of the Potomac River, to "the falls,"viz.:nine peninsulas
Stafford, formed in 1675, from Westmoreland, named in honor of Lord Stafford.
Spotsylvania, formed in 1720, from Essex, Ding William and King and Queen, and named in honor of Alexander Spotswood, a Governor of Virginia.
Prince William, formed in 1730, from King George and Stafford, named in honor of William, Duke of Cumberland.
Fairfax, formed in 1742, from Prince William, named in honor of Lord Fairfax, the proprietor of the Northern Neck.
Alexandria County, was originally a part of Fairfax county, and was ceded to the United States, to become a part of the District of Columbia for the seat of the Federal Government. In 1846 it was retroceded to Virginia, and organized as a county.
These five counties are by some authorities assigned to the " Tidewater Divisions,"and by others they are classed as being in the " Middle Virginia "section. They are intersected by tidal streams through their lands, the greater part of which is on the of tidewater.fresh water section
The soil of Tidewater Virginia is variable in its formation and fertility. The lands at the mouths of the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers are low, and composed mainly of sand and clay, devoid of stones or rocks. As the lands advance up the "Northern Neck,"there is evidence of pebbles, cobble stones, and finally a rocky formation appears upon their surface. On "the ridge "-the central region between the rivers, Rappahannock and Potomac-is found the least fertile of all its soils. Such is the case in all of the peninsulas, as one goes from the east to the west. On the ridges can be seen bare sand hills free from vegetation even during the season of verdure on the surrounding lands, and seamed into unshapely galleys by the rains and snows of centuries. In these sections can be found log cabins, and "slab" dwellings and outhouses, and "pine brush arbor cuppens "(shelters) for cattle. Fortunately there is but a small percentage of this character of land in old Virginia. Its loss of fertility is due mainly to the improvident and neglectful modes of cultivation practiced in the early years, by taking everything off the land and returning nothing to it. These poor lands when "turned out"grow good pine, and oak timber on the higher parts, and poplar and other woods in and around the galleys.
The lands on the sides of the ridges sloping gradually down to the rivers, present evidence of greater fertility, especially as they reach what is known as the "river bottom lands."These lower sections were early selected by the wealthiest planters, whose holdings were generally large, and whose dwelling houses were commensurate with their wealth and prosperity. Some of these old time dwelling houses are fine specimens of the architecture and splendor of their period. There are several of these old time dwellings yet standing along the James, York, Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Among the number is "Stratford,"the birthplace of General Robert E. Lee, in Westmoreland County. This dwelling and many of the outhouses-former servants quarters-are built of brick, and are yet in a good state of preservation. From the upper part of this dwelling house a beautiful view can be had of the Potomac River, and surrounding streams, and woodlands. The original tract contained nearly 3000 acres. A part of it is yet in the possession of a descendant of the Ire family. There are no remains of the dwellings in which either Washington, Monroe or Madison were born. Along the James are Westover, Sherley, Lower Brandon and other several rivers. They are the tears of joy which trickle down the, mountain's face as it views from its high peaks the verdure, quiet, and beauty of its lowland offspring. The numerous streams throughout Tidewater Virginia can be made to produce as much wealth as can be produced from its lands. Oysters of the finest flavor, and fish of nearly every edible species are found in its waters. Many of these streams wind their tortuous way far into the interior of the many little peninsulas. They add a charm to the landscape as they sharply turn a point of land, and hide beyond it to appear again farther away. To follow them in their gambols, one has only to seek some high point of land and he is charmed by the sight which nature in her freak of jollity has bestowed to this section of America. The forests are composed mainly of pine, which always carry an emerald hue upon their boughs, and thus form a pleasing sight during the winter months in comparison with the harder woods which shed their leaves in autumn, and shiver in their bare limbs during the chilly winter, until spring in its compassionate mood grants them cover and makes them again things of beauty.
CHAPTER III
The Indians of Virginia
When America was discovered, there were at least three distinct conditions of life amongst the Indian tribes inhabiting North America. The least advanced tribes were those in the valley of the Columbia, in the Hudson Bay Territory, in parts of Canada, California, and Mexico. The use and art of pottery, and the cultivation of gardens, or fields were unknown to these tribes.
The second, or intermediate class lucre those who subsisted upon fish, game, and the products of a limited cultivation of the soil. Many of them lived in stockaded villages. Such were the tribes of Virginia and New England, and the Creeks, Choctaws, Shawnees, Miamis, and others east of the Missouri River, and certain tribes in Mexico.
The third class were the tribes who depended upon horticulture for subsistence, cultivating maize and plants by irrigation. They constructed joint tenement houses of adobe bricks and stone, and lived together in villages. Such tribes were found in New Mexico and Mexico.
The Indians whom the colonists first met in Virginia and with whop whom they lead to deal later on, were members of the Powhatan Confederacy, a part of the Algonquin stock whose tribes extended from Cape Hatteras to Newfoundland.
The Powhatan Confederacy inhabited the Virginia tidewater section from the sea coast westward to the falls of the rivers James, Rappahannock, and Potomac, extending into the tidewater section of Maryland as far north as the Patuxent River, and southward to Carolina. It was composed of between thirty and forty tribes, the far greater number of whom were women and children. Accidents incident to hunting wild animals, and the frequent warring between tribes decimated the ranks of the men. In the wars the women and children were usually taken captive to become a part of the victorious tribe.
Each of the tribes was governed by inferior kings-Werowances-who paid tribute from the products of the chase, and of the soil to the great chief, or emperor, called Powhatan, whose subjects they and all their tribe were to his will.
The Powhatan, known to history, was between sixty and seventy years of age when the first colony reached Virginia. He was tall and powerfully built, and able to endure much fatigue. He was a man of exceptional valor and judgment, though tyrannous in his commands, and cruel in his punishments. He caused the heads of those who offended him "to be laid upon the altar or sacrificing stone and their brains beaten cut with clubs;"others were tied to a tree, and their joints cut off with oyster or clam shells, and their skin scraped from their head and face, and their bodies ripped open and burned. Powhatan lived in savage splendor surrounded by as many women as he willed: "whereof when he lieth on his bed one sitteth at his head, and another at his feet, but when he sitteth, one (woman) sitteth on his right hand and another on his left, when he dineth or suppeth, one of his women before and after meal, brought him water in a wooden platter to wash his hands. Another waiteth with a bunch of feathers to wipe them instead of a towel, and the feathers when he hath wiped are dried again. As he is weary of his women he bestows them on those that best deserve them at his hands."He was usually attended by a guard of forty or fifty of the tallest men found in his kingdom, and at night his dwelling place was guarded with sentinels who "every half hour shouted while shaking their lips with the fingers between."Part of the territory over which he ruled came to him by inheritance, the greater part by conquest. The rule of descent of his government was, upon his death, first to his brethren, and after that to his sisters, and then to the heirs, male or female of the eldest sister. In all his ancient inheritances he had houses built for his entertainment. Powhatan died in April, 1618, and was buried at the place known as Powhatan, on the James River. 1
The habitations of the Virginia Indians were built like arbors, of small young saplings bowed and tied, and covered with mats of rushes, or the barb of trees "very handsomely, that notwithstanding either wind, rain, or weather, they are warm as stoves, but very smoky, yet at the top of the house there is a hole made for the smoke to go into right over the fire."Houses were built in the midst of their fields or gardens, or by the river side, "not far distant from some fresh spring."The shell upon the shores of the tidewaters indicate the sites of the former Indian villages.banks
Their fire was kindled by friction by rapidly revolving between the palms of the hands a pointed stick pressed within a hole in a block of wood, surrounded by dry moss, or leaves: "Against the fire they lie on little hurdles of reeds covered with a mat, borne from the ground a foot or more by a hurdle of wood. On these round about the house they lie heads and points one by the other against the fire, some covered with mats, some with skins, and some stark naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house"
The Indians lived chiefly by hunting, together with the products of the water, supplemented by the products of the soil which consisted mainly of corn and pumpkins, together with the roots of artichoke--Tochnough. An old writer said: "It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their diet, even as the deer and wild beast they seem fat and lean, strong and weak. Powhatan, their great king, and some others that are provident, roast their fish and flesh upon hurdles, and keep it until scarce times. If any great commander arrive at the habitation of a Werowance (king of a tribe), they spread a mat as do the Turks, for a carpet for him to sit upon. Upon another right opposite they sit themselves. Then do all with a terrible voice of shouting bid him welcome. After this do two or more of their chiefest men make an oration, testifying their love, which they do with such vehemency, and so great passions, that they sweat till they drop, and are so out of breath they can scarce speak. So that a man would take them to be exceeding angry, or stark mad. Such victual as they have, they spend freely, and at night where his lodging is appointed they set a woman fresh painted red with Pocones and oyle to be his bed fellow."
The men spent their time in fishing, hunting, and in warring upon one another, "scorning to be seen in any womanlike exercise, which is the cause that the women be very painfull, and the men idle"The women planted and tended the crops, pounded the corn, made mats, pots, baskets, and bore all the burdens of labor. The mothers were fond of their children and never punished them, hoping thereby they would grow to be brave and courageous. To make them hardy, they were bathed in the rivers during all seasons of the year, and their bodies painted and anointed with oils or grease.
Their clothing consisted of loose mantles of turkey feathers, or the skins of wild animals, and aprons of the same material bound about the lower body. The less provident were covered with mats of rushes, grass or leaves. Their feet in winter were covered with deer skins. The women tattooed their faces, breast, arms, and legs with shapes of beasts and serpents. In their ears some had holes to hang chains or bracelets. In these holes some wore a small green, or yellow snake, which lapped itself about their neck, often coming in contact with the lips of the wearers. Their heads and shoulders when in full were painted red with Pocone.dress
During the late fall and winter months, they left their habitations by the rivers and separating into companies of a hundred or more, they built arbors for shelter in the forests, and lived by hunting. During these journeys, the women carried all the supplies and built the shelters while the men hunted.
Their manner of hunting deer was to surround the drove with many fires, and betwixt the fires were stationed men who shouted and scared the animals into the circle, where they were chased by the hunters. Where it vas convenient and possible, the deer were driven into some narrow point of land and forced into the river where the hunters lay in wait in boats to shoot them with arrows, or to kill them with clubs. The principal weapons of the Indians were clubs of hard knotty wood, or a atone sharpened at both ends and secured by deer thongs to a handle, swords from the horn o£ a deer put through a hole in a piece of wood in the form of a pickaxe, and the bow and arrows which all the tribes in North America carried. The arrows were made of straight, young: tough sprigs, headed with bone two or three inches long. These they use for hunting small game. The better sort were made of reeds pieced with wood, and headed with splinters of flinty stone, the spurs of a turkey, or the bill of some large bird, fastened thereon with glue made by boiling the tips of deer horns to a jelly. With the bow and arrow, their best shots could hit the mark on the level about forty yards, and their arrows could be shot at random about 120 yards by pointing well upward. For a knife, they used a piece of reed rubbed to a sharp point; with this implement they could unjoint a deer, shape the skin for moccasins or mantel, and for such other purposes. 2
The Indians deified all things which could harm them beyond prevention, as fire, water, lightning, thunder, winds.
Through God begetting feare, Man's blinded minde did reare, A hell God to the ghosts; A heaven God to the hoasts; Yea'. God unto the seas; Fear did create all these."
Their chief God was fashioned after their own form, carved from wood, painted and adorned with such trinkets as they could make for him. He was kept in sacred houses remote from the resident villages, which priests and kings only were permitted to visit.
These houses were also the sepulchres of their kings whose bodies were first boweled, then dried, lapped in skins and rolled in mats, with their trinkets set at their feet in baskets. For ordinary burials, holes were dug in the earth with sharp stakes, and sticks placed therein on which the bodies were laid covered with skins or mats, and the graves filled with earth.
After the burial, the women painted their faces with charcoal and grease or oil, and mourned for twenty-four hours by turns crying and yelling to express their grief. 3
The priests and conjurers mere selected from amongst those who as children were subjected to the yearly sacrifice of children, by being forced to run through a lane on which men were stationed on both sides with reeds, who beat each child as he was escorted therefrom by young men chosen for the purpose, after which they were kept nine months "in the wilderness " under the charge of the young men, "during which time they must not converse with any."Many of the children died from their wounds and exposure. This sacrifice was held to be so necessary, "that if omitted their Okee or Devil, and their other Gods would let them have no Deere, Turkies, Corne, nor fish:' Such ceremony as this was performed in 1608, by one of the tribes within ten miles of Jamestown.
"Their devotion was most in songs which the chief priest beginneth and the rest followed him, sometimes he maketh invocations with broken sentences by starts and strange passions, and at every pause the rest give a short groane."
They observed no day more sacred than another. They had solemnities in times of great distress of sickness or want of food, fear of enemies, times of triumph, and gathering of their harvests. At such times, they usually make a great fire, "and sing and dance about it with rattles and shouts together, four or five hours. Sometimes they set a man in the midst, and about him they dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands, as if he would keep time, and after their songs and dancings ended they goe to their feasts."
The leading tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy was that from which the Pamunkey River takes its name. The chief of this tribe at the date of the final settlement at Jamestown was Opechancanough, the eldest brother of Powhatan, and his successor after his death. This chief was a man of remarkable skill and ability as a ruler. It was he who made the famous capture of Captain John Smith while hunting with his tribe up the Chickahominy River; and it was he who planned the massacre of the colony in 1622. His principal seat was on the peninsula, or point of land where West Point, King William County, is now situated, between the Mattaponi and Pamunkey rivers, at the head of York River, which these two streams form.
Notwithstanding Opechancanough's prowess as a warrior, and though surrounded by his whole tribe, Captain John Smith on the occasion of a visit to his seating place, to procure corn for the colony, when he discovered this chief was attempting to betray him, seized Opechancanough by the hair, and pointing a pistol at his head forced him before all his warriors to the humiliation of compelling his men to throw down their arms and load Smith's boats with corn. After the massacre of the whites, this chief was captured, and while a prisoner at Jamestown was basely shot and killed by one of his white guards.
Directly opposite "White House Landing,"where George Washington courted the widow Custis, who afterwards became his bride, is the Pamunkey Indian Reservation, known as "Indian Town."The settlement is about a mile east of the White House, across the Pamunkey River, distant about twenty-one miles east of Richmond City, immediately on the line of the York River division of the Southern Railway. It comprises about eight hundred acres, ceded to the tribe by the General Assembly of Virginia. About one-third of the reservation is good farming land; the remainder consists of woods and swamp, which up to a few years ago was well stocked with game, such as deer, raccoons, opossums, otter, muskrats, birds, turkeys, and wild geese and ducks in the fall and spring, during their migrations. Adjacent to the reservation are several large marshes in the Pamunkey River, which up to recent years were used as commons by these people for the hunt. These marshes are now held by the adjacent land owners who use them as private grounds, or rent them to associations, or clubs of city men, thus curtailing the privileges heretofore granted this tribe.
The writer, during a visit to this reservation in August, 1906, was informed by their chief, that the privilege heretofore granted of hunting upon the wooded lands of private property adjacent to their reservation is also curtailed, and because of these changes many of their young men seek employment outside the reservation, especially during the fishing season, in the Northern Lakes, and the sea coast and its adjacent waters. ""With the money saved in these employments,"said he, "they usually return here and build, or purchase dwelling houses for their use upon the lands allotted them."
Their chief occupations are hunting, fishing, and the cultivation of truck patches and corn for their own uses. They also find employment as guides to hunting and fishing parties around the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers and vicinities. In the autumn season sora are plentiful in the marshes of these inland rivers of Virginia. The Indian method of capturing sora at night is by building a bright fire in a "sora horse:' This implement is made of strips of iron fashioned in the form of a peach basket. They were formerly made of clay, like a deep platter. When in use, the "horse "is mounted on a pole which is stuck in the marsh or placed upright in the bateau. A fire of pine light wood knots is then kindled in the "horse."The bright flames attract the sora, and as they fly around it, the Indiana knock them down with paddles.
The reservation belongs to the tribe as a whole. There is no individual ownership of land. Improvements, such as houses, are individual property, to be bought and sold at pleasure. Land is allotted to each head of a family, to be his generally for life unless a new division is necessary to provide for others. The tribe is restrained by the terms of the grant from alienating the land. The reservation is not taxed by the State, but the chief presents an annual tribute of wild turkeys, geese, or ducks, to the Governor of Virginia. The State maintains a free school on the reservation !or the benefit of the Indian children. They receive no other aid from the State or National Government. The writer upon inquiry of their chief in August, 1906, was informed that there were one hundred and sixty-one members, men, women, and children belonging to the reservation. None but those of Indian blood are permitted to reside within its limits. They are quiet, orderly people and are all members of the one small frame Baptist church, where hangs the picture of Pocahontas above the pulpit. It is said there has been a considerable intermixture of white blood, and some little of the negro in the tribe, and that therefore because of the many intermarriages there is no member of full Indian blood.
Their present chief, George M. Cook, whose Indian name is "Cayatayita,"is dignified and genteel in appearance, and has the distinguishing marks of the Indian, in his copper-colored skin, and long, straight, black hair and eyes.
In his family he maintains the English Christian names, and the Indian names for each of his children, as given the writer:
