Although invented the netbook concept as we know it today, I wouldn’t mind playing with one of the newest netbooks announced by some of Asus’ competitors. The 2140 Notebook PC is still a netbook.

It comes in an aluminum case, and idea that seems more appealing to laptops manufacturers and it can weigh as little as 2.6 pounds. The 2140 Mini will get you a 10.1 inch diagonal scratch-resistant HP Illumi-Lite LED display, a full QWERTY keyboard which is 92% of the usual notebook keyboard, and a few hard drive solutions to choose from, including an 80GB SSD. The Mini 2140 still relies on an Intel Atom to do the job and it will feature WiFi and Bluetooth support and a built-in VGA webcam. processor
And here’s why you should consider checking a new HP product before making a purchase: the 2140 will feature HP DuraKeys or a clear coating applied over the keyboard to protect the finish and printed letters and characters; the HP 3D DriveGuard which uses a three-axis-digital accelerometer to shut down the hard drive upon sudden movement or shocks; and the HP Panel Protection System which gets you that scratch-resistant LCD.
What else do you need? Well how about some patience and at least $499 to get your HP 2140 later this month when it will be available.
