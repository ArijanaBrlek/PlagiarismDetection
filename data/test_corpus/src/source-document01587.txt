RM 500 MIL SALES EXPECTED FOR HOME CAMPAIGN
The Home Ownership Campaign 2001 (HOC 2001) expects to rake in property sales of RM500mil as 10 new housing projects will be launched during the 3-month campaign.
SK Brothers Realty CEO Charlie Chan said the campaign was the last opportunity for Malaysians to take advantage of government incentives which would expire at the end of this year. Moreover, besides simplifying the process via a one-stop centre, the campaign also featured great bargains on prime properties, priced from RM 45,000 to RM 1.5 mil.
"Besides discounts of up to 25%, potential buyers can also benefit from the one-stop centre. Seven financial institutions participating in the campaign are offering up to 90% financing and low interest rates."
"This is a good time to invest in property as prices are incredibly low and the government is giving incentives such as exemption of stamp duty and waiver of processing fees," Chan said after the launching of Merdeka HOC2001 by Deputy Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk M.Kayveas in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
He added that the slight increase in property sales to RM 18.8 bil in the first half year compared with the corresponding period last year, was an encouraging sign for the property market.
Financial institutions taking part in the campaign are Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Bhd, HSBC Bank (M) Bhd, Southern Bank Bhd, Southern Finance Bhd and Standard Chartered Bank (M) Bhd.
Some 200 exhibitors are taking part in the home ownership campaign, offering properties valued at RM 3bil. The campaign is being organised by SK Brothers Realty.
