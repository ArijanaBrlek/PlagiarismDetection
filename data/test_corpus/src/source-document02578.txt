If the "101" between Los Angeles and the Central Coast has lost its glimmer, now's the perfect time to expand your horizons and see Northern California on a unique weekend getaway. In two hours, you can leave L.A. and connect with Highway 101 over 700 miles north in Eureka where giant redwood forests and beautiful bays beckon to a simpler life and slower pace.
 
Thanks to an affordable, direct flight introduced by Horizon Air in the Spring 2005, Southern Californians can be transported to an experience strikingly different from the jam-packed beaches and freeway crunches L.A. is known for.
 
Open roads and scenic highways that meander through pristine forests next to beaches and bays make for a memorable journey that surrounds you in fragrant, woodsy tones, providing a feast for the senses. Inside a redwood grove you can look up and faintly see the sky peaking through the trees, smell the refreshing scent of the 2000-year old growth and hear the beautiful sounds of silence broken only by your own footsteps. It's the two-day pause that refreshes and rejuvenates that worn out L.A. soul. This weekend escape is easy to orchestrate in a few simple steps. You book a flight on Horizon Air which is offering $238 round trip fares (www.alaskaair.com), rent a car at the small, hassle-free Arcata/Eureka Airport and by noon on Saturday you can be in the forest exploring the best that Humboldt County has to offer. (Car rental kiosks at the airport include Avis, National Car Rental and Alamo.)
 
There are so many activities and attractions in Humboldt County, it's nearly impossible to visit all of them in a single weekend. On your first excursion to the North Coast, don't miss the Avenue of the Giants. This world-famous scenic drive is a 31-mile road with 51,222 acres of redwood groves that parallels Interstate Highway 101. You can also take a boat cruise along the Humboldt Bay, shop for out-of-print books at Eureka's used book stores, browse through dozens of shops in the Victorian village of Ferndale, sample delectable Cheddars and Jacks at Loleta Cheese Factory, dine like the lumberjacks at the historic Samoa Cookhouse and watch playful Golden Lion Tamarins at the Sequoia Park Zoo.  With most attractions less than an hour's distance by car from centrally-located Eureka, the four-lane Highway 101 becomes your best friend in this neck of the woods.
