Diversity Overview
Our Mission
Diversity is linked to every aspect of our business. Our mission is to strengthen the links and make them a natural progression toward achieving corporate goals and initiatives. By recognizing and weaving differences into our corporate culture, we believe employees, shareholders, customers and communities will see unlimited potential in the future of Dominion.
One Dominion, Many Communities
Diversity is a core value assimilated into the day-to-day operations of Dominion. Although our employees, customers and suppliers are made up of many communities, we aim for an inclusive and productive environment in which differences are celebrated.
