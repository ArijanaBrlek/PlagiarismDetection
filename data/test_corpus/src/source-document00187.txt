Anatomy at University of New South Wales
 
Description
Anatomy is the study of the structure of the human body. The study of anatomy can be divided into several separate but strongly related areas:
 
Gross Anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply.
Histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells.
Embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations.
Neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord.
Physical or Biological Anthropology deals with human evolution and the relationship between humans and other primates.
In all courses in Anatomy, strong emphasis is given to the functional significance of the structures in health and in disease. The Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Medicine at UNSW both offer undergraduate programs which involve the study of anatomy. Related postgraduate study is also available.
