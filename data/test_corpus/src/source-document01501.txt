Britt deCormier, Master of Science in Space Studies
Britt deCormier earned his
Bachelor of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice from American Military University (AMU). He earned his Master of Science in Space Studies from AMU. He encouraged two of his children to check out AMU, both of whom are now enrolled. And, he encouraged two co-workers to do the same. One is now enrolled and one has already earned his masters degree. Why is deCormier such an advocate for the
online university?
Its just a great way to earn a degree, he says, referring to the universitys exceptional courses, professors and university policies . For example, he was able to earn his bachelors degree in less than two years, thanks to AMUs eight-week course options. He would take up to four courses at once, completing his bachelors in 2004. At the time, he was serving in the United States Air Force Space Command. He thought he might pursue a career as a police officer or with the U.S. Marshals Service after the military.
deCormier had joined the U.S. Air Force after serving in the U.S. Marines for nine years  an unusual move for service members to change branches. Early during his Air Force career, he worked as a C-130 aircraft crew chief. However, he soon became very sick and learned he was allergic to hydraulic fluid. deCormier was then assigned gate security duties  third shift -- at the Little Rock Air Force Base.
It was just me in a shack with a light, he says. He was able to do much of his reading for his bachelors degree on duty, completing and uploading assignments when home.
deCormier separated from the Air Force after serving four years. He then earned a position controlling satellites as a flight operations specialist, thanks to his Air Force experience and bachelor's degree.
De Cormier knew further education was necessary for him to advance on his new career path. Space operations had been an interest of his since childhood, however. He grew up in Satellite Beach, Fla., where he watched many space shuttle launches.
deCormier chose AMU again -- this time for its masters program in space studies and graduated in May 2008.  support of my wife, Carisa, deCormier says. I believe Im where Im supposed to be. He was able to study at work - and his company paid much of his . deCormier says AMU's courses in orbital mechanics, ground systems and others were a direct fit for his job of monitoring satellites. He feels his bachelor's degree, although in a different field, was still valuable. It showed his commitment to education and self-improvement.  deCormier is pleased with where he is in his life, and is even considering pursuing his doctorate someday. I would not have succeeded in any of these studies without the help and tuition
