FAQ's
FAQ's: Do I have to register to race also? YES. Signing up to raise funds thru TFT does not register you to participate in the Triathlon. Please register asap--the race sold out in August last year.
Do I have to pay race fee if I plan to raise $$? YES. You still have to register and pay for the race. Refunds will be issued the week after the race if you have raised at least $300. You will receive an email notification asking if you would like a refund or your race fee applied to your fund raising page. 
Can I meet my tri ibuddy? YES. The Center will host a tri buddy picnic in June to allow time for athletes to meet their tri buddy patients.
Will my tri buddy be there on race day? Some tri buddies will make it to the race, others may not. Race day is a hectic time, that is why we arrange for the opportunity to meet on a different day prior to the race.
Who should donor make checks payable to? Mary Gooley Hemophilia Center
Are TFT donations tax deductible? YES. All donors that provide contact info will receive a thank you letter from the Center for their donation to your page. This letter will act as their receipt for tax purposes.
How will I receive my incentive prizes? Prizes will be distributed at packet pick up or on race day or can picked up at the Center after the race M-F 8-4:30pm.
What should I do with cash and checks I have collected offline? Cash and checks can be mailed or hand delivered to the Center, turned in at packet pick, turned in at the Center tent on race day, or sent to the office after the race. All offline donations will be added to your online page once received and thank you letters will be sent to the donors for tax purposes.
