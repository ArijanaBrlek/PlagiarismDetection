Registering with Accommodations
If you have a documented disability, you may be eligible for accommodations on SAT Program tests. Arrangements can be made if you need adjustments to the test setting, such as wheelchair accessibility or seating where you can lip read; or if you need other accommodations such as a printed copy of spoken directions, or access to snacks or medicine due to a medical condition. To receive test accommodations, you need to apply for and receive College Board approval. Scores may be canceled if it is determined that you received accommodations that were not approved by the College Board.
Follow the instructions below to apply for accommodations and register for the SAT with approved accommodations. We recommend that you apply for your accommodations before you submit your registration. Once you have received your Eligibility Approval Letter stating your accommodations, then you should submit your registration. For further information, ask your counselor or go online at . www.collegeboard.com/ssd
Applying for Accommodations
You must complete a Student Eligibility Form (available from your counselor). If you are requesting accommodations that you receive at your school, your school must also complete part of the form.
If possible, submit the form in the spring before your first College Board test (PSAT/NMSQT, AP, or SAT) to ensure enough time to process your application.
If you move to a new school after you have been approved for accommodations, your new school will need to confirm your continued eligibility.
