Childhood Obesity
Today, 9 million children over age six are considered obese. These children have a higher risk of developing serious health problems later in life, including heart attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.  In addition, increases in childhood obesity may cost governments, businesses, and families $100 billion per year in future health costs, undermining the long-term health and vitality of communities.
Municipal leaders can promote healthy lifestyles by encouraging physical activity and good nutrition.  While there are no "quick fixes," city officials can stimulate and shape local initiatives, promote collaboration across organizations and programs, and support effective programming that improves the health of the nation's children and youth.
