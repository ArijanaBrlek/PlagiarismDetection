Relocation Guide
In this section, we'll help you find everything you need to know about moving around, out of, or to, Virginia as far as the DMV and general information is concerned.
We have carefully compiled the details covering all the topics related to these situations. For example, if you have just moved to Virginia we have listed how long before you must switch over your drivers license and car registration, what identification youll need to do that, how much those fees will cost, and where to find the DMV closest to your new home.
And on the other hand, if you are moving out of your current state there are likely some tasks that you will need to clean up with the DMV before you leave. Well tell you about whether you need to turn over your current Virginia license plates, whether you may be entitled to a prorated refund on your car registration, and if you need to submit an address change.
We've also packed the pages of this section with plenty of other information that will save you time during your move. If it has to do with moving within, to, or moving from Virginia, it's in this section.
