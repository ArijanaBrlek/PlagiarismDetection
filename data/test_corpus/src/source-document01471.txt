National Museum of Asian Art Guimet
Ranging in date from 2200 BC to AD 200, the objects present a rich mosaic of Afghanistan's cultural heritage and are drawn from four archaeological sites. The works include gold bowls with artistic links to Mesopotamia from Tepe Fullol in northern Afghanistan; bronze and stone sculptures from the site of the former Greek city of Aï Khanum; bronzes, ivories, and painted glassware imported from Roman and Indian markets discovered in Begram; and more than 100 gold ornaments from among the 20,000 pieces known as the "Bactrian Hoard," found in 1978 in Tillya Tepe, the site of six nomad graves.
Maps will illustrate the locations of some 1500 archaeological sites, ancient cities, the routes known as the Silk Road, and regions that relate to the artifacts. A documentary film narrated by celebrated Afghan-American author, Khaled Hosseini, explores ancient Afghan culture, the history of these collections and their dramatic rediscovery. Short films throughout the show will include recreations of Aï Khanum and one of the intricately carved chairs—thought to be thrones—found there.
