Castle Gatehouse at Stevens Institute of Technology
North side
is the highest point in Hoboken. The name is a corruption of "Castille Point", due to its supposed resemblance to the Castilian coast in Spain. To early navigators, the high crag jutting over the river reminded them of a miniature Rock of Gibraltar (although the Rock of Gibraltar is actually in Andalusia, not Castile which has no coast). The land was bought at public auction in 1804 by , who built his estate there. After his death, his son took responsibility of the estate and in 1853 built a 40-room mansion, the "Stevens Castle", on land adjacent to the point. It was acquired by in 1910 and served as an administrative and residential building until 1959. Castle Point is still part of the Stevens campus. On the side of Castle Point is historic Sybil's Cave, which is now bricked up.Castle Point serpentine Col. John Stevens [1] Edwin Augustus Stevens Stevens Institute of Technology

In 1994, the wooden playground that had been in place for a long time was destroyed and replaced with a safer, more packaged playground. The newer playground has been in the park for 11 years and has remained practically unchanged since it was built in the mid-90's.
In 2005, a memorial grove, containing trees dedicated to a fire victim, was relocated to a less attractive part of the park to make way for a toddler playground, despite public opposition. Questions were raised about the toddler playground's necessity, and those opposed to the project argued that there was no need for it since there were already 3 playgrounds within Church Square Park. They also argued that the new toddler playground was an eyesore and had replaced too much open space (at the time, 6 major fields were reduced to 5). In March 2005, the oldest tree in Church Square Park was killed because it was in the way of the construction of the toddler playground. Despite the toddler playground's controversial status and public disapproval, it was finished in April, 2005.
In the spring of 2007, three very old trees in Church Square Park, including 2 trees, were killed when construction began on the small park's fifth playground, removing more open space; it has been heavily criticized by local citizens who say that the poor planning caused the deaths of the trees and that the new playground was not needed. Mayor said his decision to build the playground was influenced by the schools and parents. Efforts have been made to dismantle the playground, which lies near the Hoboken Public Library, but all have failed so far. In July 2007, construction began on the park's sixth playground without warning. London plane [3] David Roberts [3]
[] edit Columbus Park
is a park near Hoboken High School at the corner of 9th Street and Clinton Street. There was originally a one-of-a-kind playground, tall as a three story building with unusual equipment. It was destroyed in October 2002 to make way for a more normal, packaged (and safer) playground, in the name of Deborah Lynn Williams, a woman who was killed in the in the . Because of the new playground's memorial status, the original playground will probably never be re-built. The original playground was made up of 3 sections: the first section contained a complex of chains for climbing, 3 platforms, and a very tall slide made of plastic (probably the tallest in Hoboken), which curved and could be seen over 6 blocks away. The second section was a large castle-like structure with a slide, two entrances and a pole for sliding. The third section was a series of unusual and unique space-like metal domes, which kids could crawl through and create echos. All of this equipment was disrespectfully trashed and thrown out in 2002. The new playground has only one section, and is considered by most to be unoriginal compared to the first playground. No photos are known to exist of the original playground.Columbus Park World Trade Center September 11 Terrorist Attacks
