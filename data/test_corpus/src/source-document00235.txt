Humidifier plant robot
In recent researches by Chonnam, a Korean National University has developed a novelty Robotic plant. According to the source, this robotic plant was developed under a low cost and maintenance, but could do a bunch of cool plant-like activity and even reacting to certain situation.
Smart Robotic Plant - Promising life safer for the worst future...
This Robotic Plant would respond to movement, illumination, and sounds. It could also emit certain smells, humidifying the room and produce oxygen for us.
It’s a promising concept for future if we are unable to stop the global warming. all “real” plant will die of the hot temperature, all left this “fake” plant to produce oxygen. The question is, with what material this plant would use to convert into a breathable oxygen…?
