About our dietary information
The caloric and nutritional values provided on DRINKSMIXER.COM are guidelines automatically generated from a database of caloric values for seperate beverages and food items. It is NOT guaranteed. It is not strictly accurate, contains discrepancies, and can sometimes be wholly innacurate. And while we do our best to provide the most accurate information on each beverage and food item, we've found that nutritional information for alcoholic beverages is incredibly difficult to attain or research.
One of our aims in providing the nutritional information you find on DRINKSMIXER.COM is to allow people (who, for varied reasons, are monitoring the caloric values of what they consume) the ability to include beverages, particularly the recipes found on DRINKSMIXER.COM, in their daily diet or routine. The information we provide on each recipe (a calculation of each ingredient) can be incredibly useful for this reason, allowing people to estimate the caloric intake and other intake from consuming the drinks. On the whole, we believe most recipes are in a good range of accuracy. Please be advised however, that at any one time, information can be misleading and should not be used for reassurance of any medical needs. Calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and all other values listed are NOT guaranteed! If you are following a medically restrictive diet, please consult your doctor or registered dietitian before preparing any recipe on this website for personal consumption.
