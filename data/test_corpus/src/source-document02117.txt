Known locally as a "meat wagon", the vehicles are synonymous with Northern Ireland's Troubles. At the height of the Troubles the vehicles were essential for patrolling across Northern Ireland. At this time they were painted a plain grey. A number of people were killed after being hit by the vehicles during the Troubles, usually in riot situations. [1]

For instance, they are now in use with the West Yorkshire and North Wales police services. [2] [3]
