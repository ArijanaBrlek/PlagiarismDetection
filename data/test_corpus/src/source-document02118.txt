What is continuing education and why is it important?
Continuing education usually refers to a broad range of learning activities and training programs that aim to improve the knowledge and skills of an individual about a certain subject or topic, which in this case is diabetes.
In formal terms, continuing education is like adult education because it usually extends beyond undergraduate and university studies.  However, continuing education can also include other trainings and learning programs, such as those achieved through vocational and certification training.  It may be achieved through formal and traditional classroom learning, tutorial, correspondence or online courses.
How professionals can participate in continuing education courses
There are a variety of courses available for health care providers, most of which are offered as specialized learning, depending on the individual's field of specialization.  Accreditation and earned credits for the continuing education of physicians, for example, are different for nurses, psychologists or podiatrists.
To earn credits for taking continuing education courses in diabetes, the learning provider must be accredited by the ACCME or Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education.  Nurse practitioners, for example, should look for courses or course providers who are approved by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners while psychologists should find courses approved by the American Psychological Association.
This is to ensure that courses and activities included in the continuing education program are relevant and duly approved.  To encourage quality among its participants, these courses can only be credited depending on the extent of the individual's participation in the given activities.
