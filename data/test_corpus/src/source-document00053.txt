Vacation in French Lick and West Baden Indiana close to Indiana University and the historic Brown County Indiana artists colony
French Lick Indiana got its name from early French settlers and the ineral licksin the area. French traders came to the area and discovered the mineral springs bubbling from the ground in the vicinity of what is now French Lick. Wildlife came to lick the mineral deposits left on the ground and rocks. In the early 1800's settlers began to bottle and sell the "Pluto Water" from the springs. In the early 1800's Doc Bowles built the first hotel, a three story frame building. The community thrived and there was an influx of tourist traffic coming to drink and soak in the mineral waters. In the 1850's French Lick was a key station in the "underground railway". The French Lick Springs Resort and Spa was built in the late 1800's. Tom Taggert purchased the property in 1901 and, with the help of the Monon Railroad, the former Indianapolis mayor turned the sleepy little resort into an international attraction. Many hoosiers traveled to French Lick by train. The old train depot remains in downtown French Lick.
