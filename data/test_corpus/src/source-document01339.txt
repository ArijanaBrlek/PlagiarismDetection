In exchange for his help in eliminating her master, Kagura offers Sesshomaru the shard of the Sacred Jewel taken from Koga. Inu-Yasha attempts to regain it, but the ill-timed coming of the new moon threatens to reveal his secret. How much has Kagura seen? Meanwhile, Miroku (plus Sango) head into the woods to investigate the disappearance of an entire village's male population. Is this "beautiful princess" they've heard of somehow connected? Elsewhere, Naraku recreates himself yet again. Unlike previous "versions" of himself, this one is different... dangerous. It's a part of himself he has longed to be rid of for a long time, but will the price prove too high not only for Naraku but for Inu-Yasha as well?
