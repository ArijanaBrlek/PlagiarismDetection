Bio-based Nanoparticles and Nanowire Formation
Ann Miracle
This project will characterize and quantify titanium dioxide (titania, TiO2) nanoparticles during flow through a bench-scale aquatic system composed of different environmental media (i.e., water, sediment, and benthic/sediment dwelling invertebrates) to monitor the fate and transport of the material. Nanomaterial partitioning and complexation in water, sediment, and tissue media will be characterized using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The data sets derived from this work will build the foundation for future use in fate and transport of other nanomaterials in different aquatic systems (i.e., freshwater, estuarine, and marine) and in building both process and empirical models that can be used to investigate environmental fate and transport and the ecological impact of nanomaterials.Fate and Transport of Titanium Dioxide in Freshwater Mesocosms:

This project will conduct static and flow-through, bench-scale mesocosm studies in order to investigate the chemical, physical and biological changes to silver nanoparticles in a riverine environment. A hydrodynamic model of the fate and transport of silver nanomaterial will be constructed on the basis of the information learned through these studies. The expected outcomes for the project are: 1) characterization of silver nanoparticles in Columbia River water and sediment; 2) evaluation of nanosilver bioaccumulation in benthic biota and changes to species diversity based on nanosilver dose; 3) predictive fate and transport model for nanosilver in a riverine system.Fate, Transport and Transformation of silver nanoparticles in a Freshwater Mesocosm:
