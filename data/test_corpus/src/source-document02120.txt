departed San Diego on March 8, 1976 and four days later entered drydock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, WA, to commence a 100-million dollar complex overhaul scheduled to last 12.5 months. This overhaul configured to operate with the F-14 and S-3A aircraft in a total CV sea control mode. This included adding spaces for storage, ordnance handling and maintenance facilities for the two aircraft. Also included in the work package were more efficient work areas for air frames and a repair facility for ground support equipment and the addition of avionics support capability for the S-3. The ship also replaced the Surface-to-Air missile system with the NATO system, and added elevators and modified weapons magazines to provide an increased capability for handling and stowing the newer, larger air launched weapons. The carrier completed the overhaul in March 1977 and departed the shipyard April 1 of that year to return to San Diego.Kitty HawkHawkTomcatVikingTerrierSea Sparrow
