Pre-Marriage Coaching
vWhy Take A Course
While planning a wedding is an important task, it is even more important to make plans for the (hopefully) longer lasting celebration that is marriage. Your wedding is one day  the marriage is the rest of your lives. A pre-marriage course is an opportunity to identify your hopes and dreams for the future and to get into the habit of keeping the lines of communication open and effective.
Couples who do not address critical issues such as finance, religion, family, etc., risk running into serious disagreements that could derail their lifelong journey. Pre-marriage courses can help couples uncover important issues that they may be uncomfortable discussing and provide ways of addressing these issues effectively before they become a problem. Our goal is to get couples to shift from the engagement stage to being ready to build a successful marriage. Pre-marriage courses put couples through exercises and challenges to get a sense of whether they have what it takes to make the relationship work.
Our pre-marriage course uses tried and tested principles to give couples a fighting chance when they hit the inevitable roadblocks that married life presents. As well, when couples meet those roadblocks, a pre-marriage course will ideally have trained them to shift their focus from who done it to how we can draw upon our resources to work through it ? Contrary to popular belief, its not the problems we face, but rather how we handle them that determines how well we will negotiate marriage. Successful marriages are ones in which both partners are taking responsibility for their actions and theyre contributing fully to make their relationship work.dotogether

vCouples Questionnaire
Couple questionnaires or couple inventories are not tests. There are no right or wrong answers. Each individual will answer questions touching on all aspects of married life. The responses are compared with not only each other's, but also to exhaustive counseling research. The resulting comprehensive report is an inventory of your couple strengths or building blocks and challenges or stumbling stones. Together with the counselor, the report will be reviewed. Using the Building a Stronger Marriage Workbook, a strategy for overcoming stumbling stones by using building blocks will be developed to build a more vital and satisfying relationship
 
vTools
We utilize a number of tools in this process, including: The internationally recognized Prepare/Enrich Inventories program- a 165 question questionnaire assessing relationship strength and growth areas in 15 categories.
vCredentials
We bring over 20 years of counseling experience into our marriage preparation sessions.We also have 12 years of training in the Prepare/Enrich curriculum.
