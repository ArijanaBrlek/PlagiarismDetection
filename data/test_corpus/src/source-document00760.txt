Two Missourian Reporters Win Second Place in Missouri AP Managing Editors Contest
Columbia, Mo. (April 12, 2004) -- reporters Bryan Clark and Pat Healy have received second-place finishes in the Missouri Associated Press Managing Editors News Writing Contest. The newspaper is the working lab for students in news-editorial, design, information graphics and photojournalism. Columbia Missourian
Clark, a senior news-editorial student from West Chester, Ohio, placed in the sports feature category for his story chronicling a road trip taken during the first season of the Mavericks baseball team in Columbia. He serves as an assistant city editor at the Missourian. Healy, BJ '03, wrote on the suicide of a 17-year-old accused of rape. The article competed in the feature writing category and ran in Vox magazine. He now is a reporter for The New York Times.
"These awards are especially meaningful because the competition is among working, professional newspapers, not student publications," said Tom Warhover, executive editor of the Missourian. "Pat and Bryan typify what it means to learn by the Missouri Method of doing journalism 'live.'"
The contest drew 190 entries from 18 newspapers in Missouri and was judged by newspaper staffs from Nebraska and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. The APME awards honor outstanding work by journalists to serve the public, to preserve and enhance public access to needed information and to give readers a broader understanding of the world around them.
APME is an organization of editors and managing editors of the more than 1,500 newspapers served by the AP.
