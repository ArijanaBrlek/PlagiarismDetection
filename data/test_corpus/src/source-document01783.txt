2007 Feb;131(2):217-24. Abstract quote CONTEXT: Orthopedic and spine surgeons are in frequent need of bone for skeletal reconstruction. The amount of autograft is limited, and conventional allograft has some disadvantages, so surgeons are now using increasing amounts of demineralized allograft and a variety of synthetic materials to replace or "extend" autograft. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the composition and histology of the materials most likely to be seen by pathologists today. DATA SOURCES: The review is based on published literature and the author's experience with preclinical studies and human biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologists are likely to find these skeletal substitute materials in biopsy and resection specimens from patients who have undergone prior treatment, and recognizing a synthetic bone substitute can help explain an otherwise confusing specimen. Pathologists also play an important role in helping define the safety and efficacy of new bioactive materials. Arch Pathol Lab Med.

Synovial metaplasia is a change seen most frequently in the tissues surrounding silicone breast prostheses and in healing tissue adjacent to joint prostheses. It has also been described in skin and soft tissues, most frequently in healing or healed traumatic or surgical wounds.
We report a case of synovial metaplasia occurring in a hitherto unreported location, namely, adjacent to a silicone low-pressure voice prosthesis. A review of cases of synovial metaplasia reported in the literature revealed that in most cases, spaces that form adjacent to foreign material (most commonly silicone breast prostheses) and the smooth gliding surfaces of the foreign material that resist penetration by fibroblast processes are frequent associated findings that precede the occurrence of synovial metaplasia.
Thus, synovial metaplasia might represent a specialized form of healing in cases that have this combination of physical features.
TENOSYNOVIAL CHONDROMATOSIS
 
Tenosynovial (extraarticular) chondromatosis: an analysis of 37 cases of an underrecognized clinicopathologic entity with a strong predilection for the hands and feet and a high local recurrence rate.

Tenosynovial chondromatosis is a multinodular cartilaginous proliferation that arises from the tenosynovial membranes. This report describes the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings in 37 cases of this uncommon entity. There were 17 males and 20 females, ranging in age from 20 to 86 years (mean and median age, 46 years). The process involved tenosynovium of the fingers (n = 19), feet (n = 8), wrists (n = 4), ankles (n = 2), hand, not otherwise specified, or palm (n = 2), knee (n = 1), and forearm (n = 1). Signs of disease or symptoms were present for 5 weeks to 18 years (median duration, approximately 2 years) before surgical excision. The two most common complaints were a painless mass and a mass that was mildly tender with pressure. None of the tumors had clinical, radiologic, or histopathologic evidence of articular or bone involvement. Histologically, all tumors consisted of a multinodular cartilaginous proliferation involving tenosynovium and/or subsynovial connective tissue. Mild or moderate atypia, as encountered in chondroma of soft parts and synovial chondromatosis, was a frequent finding. Follow-up information was available for 16 patients (43%). Only two patients with follow-up information remained disease free after their initial surgical procedure. Seven patients had one recurrence and seven patients had two or more recurrences. Tenosynovial chondromatosis appears to be an extraarticular counterpart of synovial (intraarticular) chondromatosis. Our review indicates this process is often confused with chondroma of soft parts, in part, because both entities have a predilection for the hands and feet. Diagnosis of this underrecognized entity is of clinical importance because of the high local recurrence rate.
