Target to phase out hazardous PVC
Great news came from Tar-jay this week. This letter from the group Making Our Milk Safe describes the actions the mega-retailer will be taking:
Dear MOMS Member:
On the heels of our victory in California to ban phthalates in children's products, we're writing to share some incredible news of another big win. After working with our coalition partners for a year and a half to persuade Target, one of the nation's top retailers, to phase out PVC, the company today announced plans to eliminate the chemical from its private label products and packaging. This is indeed a victory for parents and for the planet. With all of the news about toy recalls due to lead, moving away from toys made with PVC, the poison plastic, means fewer toxic toys will be found on store shelves.
 In addition to addressing their owned brands, they are collaborating with a variety of vendors and will also work with other suppliers whose products are sold at Target.  The company is taking the following steps in their owned brands:
Eliminating PVC from a number of infant products and toys.   Target children's eating utensils and lunchboxes are now PVC-free.  Target baby bibs will be PVC-free by January 2008. The company is phasing out phthalates in most of their toys by Fall 2008.  They are also eliminating phthalates in baby changing tables by January 2008.
Replacing many PVC/Vinyl shower curtains with a safer PVC-free plastic, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). Target expects 88% of its shower curtains to be PVC free by this coming spring. Researchers at the EPA have reported that a new vinyl shower curtain, "can cause elevated indoor air toxics concentrations?for more than a month." Customers have repeatedly complained on Target's website about strong chemical odors being released from vinyl shower curtains purchased at Target.
Target will be 96% PVC-free in their placemat and table linen categories by Spring 2008.
Target soft-sided coolers are now PVC-free.
Reducing PVC in packaging. Target is reducing PVC packaging in the company's Target brand dinnerware, travel accessories, toys and sporting goods. For food packaging, Target has a requirement in place to avoid the use of PVC when possible.  In the media category (clamshells/blisters in electronics), Target is replacing the PVC clamshell with a modified paperboard/plastic packaging. For instance, iPod carrying cases sold at Target are being packaged in PVC-free packaging.  The company is also asking their vendors to reduce the amount of packaging on their products and use materials that are easily recyclable.
Target has engaged their merchandiser buyers through the development and distribution of a new Sustainable Products Guide, which includes a specific section on issues surrounding PVC.
We are thrilled that Target has taken this step in the right direction. We'll be monitoring their progress and encouraging other retailers to make the same move. Thank you for all of your letters, phone calls, and rally participation--we couldn't have done this without you!

P.S. Check out my article in the current issue of Mothering Magazine, titled "Out of the Mouths of Babes". The article talks about Bisphenol A and phthalates in children's products. It's on newsstands now.
Our goal should obviously be that any person be it a parent or not, should be able to walk into any store and buy any product without having to think that maybe this one will contain toxic chemicals. At least we can walk into Target now and not have to worry too much about PVC. We still have a long way to go, but this shows that retailers will listen if we press them about these important issues.
