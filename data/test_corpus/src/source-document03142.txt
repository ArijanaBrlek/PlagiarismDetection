In 2000, Daniel Bauer was honored with the extraordinary title of “successor to the legendary Harry Houdini.” As a world-class escape artist, Mr. Bauer performed on WB, Fox, and NBC, and was poised for international stardom. That is, until he was diagnosed as HIV Positive, and he lost everything; his sponsors dropped him, his parents abandoned him, and he spiraled into the desperate self-loathing of a drug-induced rock bottom. Today, Bauer stands as one of the nation’s largest public figures for HIV/AIDS awareness and fights against the stigmas and discrimination associated with the diagnosis. At Lafayette, he will share his personal experiences on fame, fortune, and a life with HIV/AIDS. We have seen him at the Campus LGBT Conference in Albany, NY and were absolutely captivated; he commands the attention necessary for attention to our prejudices, and proactive discourse and action.Thursday, October 16 8:00pm, Marlo Room, Farinon Center

A particular favorite in the world of Jewish comedy, Joel’s innovative experience-based, positive Jewish humor has garnered him a cult-like following among the People of the Book and widespread recognition in the Jewish press. Joel recently made his Israeli television debut when he performed a five-minute comedy set – in Hebrew – on the late-night show Tonight With Assaf Har-El. Joel attended college at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was the Director and Head Writer of the Mask and Wig Comedy Club, America’s oldest all-male comedy troupe. During college he spent two summers with the Philadelphia Phillies baseball organization as an on-field performer in a fruitless attempt to entertain 40,000 of the world’s heaviest-drinking sports fans.Friday, October 24, 10pm
