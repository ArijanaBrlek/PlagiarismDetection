Its main objective is to have the best card combination (‘hand’ in other words), and the players best online casinos
are placing a bet due to the cards’ values that they are holding. The player who has the highest card combination is the winner, or the one who remains with a hand when his opponents have already folded. Now let’s take a closer look to the cards. The number of cards used in Poker games is of 52. Every single card has a rank and a suit.

We will start with the lowest value up to the highest one: Texas Hold`em
- High Card:
If someone has a High Card, it means that he doesn’t have a good hand; in other words he cannot make any valuable combination with his cards.
- Pair:
A Pair is made of a hand that has two cards having the same numbering (rank) and different suit, plus three other cards which are known as ‘kickers’.
- Two pair:
This is a hand which is consisting of one ‘kicker’ and four other cards out of which two cards of the same rank are forming a pair and the other two as well, separately.
- Three of a Kind:
This is a card combination that is formed of two ‘kickers’ plus three cards having the same rank.
- Straight:
A Straight hand means that you have accumulated a hand having five consecutive cards. Here only the rank can be taken into consideration, and the suit does not play any role.
- Flush:
This kind of hand is made of five cards of the same suit.
- Full House:
This is made of a ‘Pair’ plus three other cards having the same rank.
- Four of a Kind:
This type of card combination contains four cards which have the same rank and a ‘kicker’. The benefit of this extra card is to evaluate the ‘Four of a Kind’ hand in case there are more players who have the same combination; the ‘kicker’ is what the winner depends on.
