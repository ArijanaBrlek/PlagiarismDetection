Ancient history
The Bushmen
Some three million years ago, -human-like hominids migrated to South Africa. Around a million years ago, gradually replaced them. The first () appeared around 100,000 years ago, and formed the so-called Bushman culture of hunter-gatherers possibly between 40,000 and 25,000 years ago. ape homo erectus homo sapiens modern humans
Beginning around 500 BCE, some Bushman groups acquired livestock from further south. Gradually, hunting and gathering gave way to herding as the dominant economic activity as these Bushmen tended to small herds of and oxen. The arrival of livestock introduced concepts of personal wealth and - ownership into Bushman society. Community structures solidified and expanded, and chieftaincies developed. These pastoralist Bushmen became known as Khoikhoi ('men of men'), as opposed to the still hunter-gatherer Bushmen, whom the Khoikhoi referred to as . At the point where the two groups became intermarried, mixed and hard to tell apart, the term arose. Over time the Khoikhoi established themselves along the coast, while small groups of Bushmen continued to inhabit the interior. cattle property SanKhoisan
Bantu expansion
Around 2,500 years ago Bantu peoples migrated into Southern Africa from the . The Bushmen and the Bantu lived mostly peacefully together, although since neither had any method of , researchers know little of this period outside of artifacts. Niger River Delta writing archaeological
The Bantu peoples had started to make their way south and eastwards in about 1000 BC, reaching the present-day KwaZulu-Natal Province by AD 500. The Bantu-speakers not only had domestic animals, but also practiced agriculture, farming and other crops. They also displayed skill in working , and lived in settled villages. The Bantu arrived in South Africa in small waves rather than in one cohesive migration. Some groups, the ancestors of today's Nguni peoples (the , Xhosa, Swazi, and Ndebele), preferred to live near the coast. Others, now known as the Sotho-Tswana peoples ( Tswana, Pedi, and Basotho), settled in the Highveld, while today's Venda, Lemba, and Shangaan- Tsonga peoples made their homes in the northeastern areas of South Africa. wheat iron Zulu
Bantu-speakers and Khoisan mixed, as evidenced by rock paintings showing the two different groups interacting. The type of contact remains unknown, although proof of integration survives, as several Bantu languages (notably Xhosa and Zulu) incorporated the click consonant characteristic of earlier Khoisan languages. Archaeologists have found numerous Khoisan artifacts at the sites of Bantu settlements. linguistic
Colonization
European expeditions

Although the basked in the nautical achievement of successfully navigating the cape, they showed little interest in colonisation. The area's fierce weather and rocky shoreline posed a threat to their ships, and many of their attempts to trade with the local Khoikhoi ended in conflict. The Portuguese found the Mozambican coast more attractive, with appealing bays to use as way stations, , and links to gold ore in the interior. Portuguese prawns
The Portuguese had little competition in the region until the late 16th century, when the English and Dutch began to challenge the Portuguese along their . Stops at the continent's southern tip increased, and the cape became a regular stopover for -ridden crews. In 1647, a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the present-day Table Bay at .

Arrival of the Dutch

Shortly thereafter, the Dutch East India Company (in the Dutch of the day: , or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the to the East, had no intention of colonising the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of , , and . To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of Jan van Riebeeck reached Table Bay on April 6, 1652.Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spice route meat fruit vegetables
While the new settlement out of necessity with the neighbouring Khoikhoi, it wasn't a friendly relationship, and the Company authorities made deliberate attempts to restrict contact. Partly as a consequence, VOC employees found themselves faced with a labour shortage. To remedy this, they released a small number of Dutch from their contracts and permitted them to establish farms, with which they would supply the VOC settlement from their . This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, , and ; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of free burghers, as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east into the territory of the Khoikhoi. traded harvests wheat wine
The majority of burghers had Dutch ancestry and belonged to the Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands, but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French Huguenots, also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in under . France King Louis XIV
In addition to establishing the free burgher system, van Riebeeck and the VOC also began to import large numbers of , primarily from and . These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the Cape Coloureds and the Cape Malays. A significant number of the offspring from the White and slave unions were absorbed into the local proto- speaking White population. With this additional labour, the areas occupied by the VOC expanded further to the north and east, with inevitable clashes with the Khoikhoi. The newcomers drove the Khoikhoi from their traditional lands, decimated them with introduced , and destroyed them with superior when they fought back, which they did in a number of major wars and with guerrilla resistance movements that continued into the 19th century. Most survivors were left with no option but to work for the Europeans in an exploitative arrangement that differed little from . Over time, the Khoisan, their European overseers, and the imported slaves mixed, with the offspring of these unions forming the basis for today's Coloured population. slaves Madagascar Indonesia Afrikaans diseases weapons slavery
The best-known Khoikhoi groups included the Griqua, who had originally lived on the western coast between St Helena Bay and the Cederberg Range. In the late 18th century, they managed to acquire guns and and began trekking northeast. En route, other groups of Khoisan, Coloureds, and even white adventurers joined them, and they rapidly gained a reputation as a formidable military force. Ultimately, the Griquas reached the Highveld around present-day Kimberley, where they carved out territory that came to be known as Griqualandalina. horses
Burgher expansion

As the burghers, too, continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic pastoralist lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the Khoikhoi they displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a wagon, a tent, a , and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a mud-walled cottage, frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the Trekboers (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to Boers), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated. Their harsh lifestyle produced individualists who were well acquainted with the land. Like many pioneers with Christian backgrounds, the burghers attempted to live their lives based on teachings from the . Bible Bible
British at the cape
As the 18th century drew to a close, Dutch mercantile power began to fade and the British moved in to fill the vacuum. They seized the Cape in 1795 to prevent it from falling into the hands of Napoleonic France, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitely conquering it in 1806. British sovereignty of the area was recognized at the Congress of Vienna in . 1815
At the tip of the continent the British found an established colony with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 Khoisan, and 1,000 freed black slaves. Power resided solely with a white élite in , and differentiation on the basis of race was deeply entrenched. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white pastoralists populated the country. Cape Town
Like the Dutch before them, the British initially had little interest in the Cape Colony, other than as a strategically located port. As one of their first tasks they tried to resolve a troublesome border dispute between the Boers and the Xhosa on the colony's eastern frontier. In the British authorities persuaded about 5,000 middle-class British immigrants (most of them "in ") to leave Great Britain behind and settle on tracts of land between the feuding groups with the idea of providing a buffer zone. The plan was singularly unsuccessful. Within three years, almost half of these 1820 Settlers had retreated to the towns, notably Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth, to pursue the jobs they had held in Britain. 1820 trade
While doing nothing to resolve the border dispute, this influx of settlers solidified the British presence in the area, thus fracturing the relative unity of white South Africa. Where the Boers and their ideas had before gone largely unchallenged, white South Africa now had two distinct language groups and two distinct cultures. A pattern soon emerged whereby English-speakers became highly urbanised, and dominated , , , , and , while the largely uneducated Boers were relegated to their farms. politics trade finance mining manufacturing
The gap between the British settlers and the Boers further widened with the abolition of slavery in , a move that the Boers generally regarded as against the God-given ordering of the races. Yet the British settlers' conservatism stopped any radical social reforms, and in 1841 the authorities passed a Masters and Servants Ordinance, which perpetuated white control. Meanwhile, numbers of British immigrants increased rapidly in Cape Town, in the area east of the Cape Colony (present-day Eastern Cape Province), in Natal and, after the discovery of and , in parts of the Transvaal, mainly around present-day Gauteng. 1833 gold diamonds

The full causes of the remain in dispute, although certain factors stand out. The rise of a unified Zulu kingdom had particular significance. In the early 19th century, Nguni tribes in KwaZulu-Natal began to shift from a loosely-organised collection of kingdoms into a centralised, militaristic state. , son of the chief of the small Zulu clan, became the driving force behind this shift. At first something of an outcast, Shaka proved himself in battle and gradually succeeded in consolidating power in his own hands. He built large armies, breaking from clan tradition by placing the armies under the control of his own officers rather than of the hereditary chiefs. Shaka then set out on a massive programme of expansion, killing or enslaving those who resisted in the territories he conquered. His (warrior regiments) were rigorously disciplined: failure in battle meant death.difaqane Shaka Zulu impis
Peoples in the path of Shaka's armies moved out of his way, becoming in their turn aggressors against their neighbours. This wave of displacement spread throughout and beyond. It also accelerated the formation of several states, notably those of the Sotho (present-day ) and of the Swazi (now ). Southern Africa Lesotho Swaziland
In Shaka was killed by his half-brothers Dingaan and Umthlangana. The weaker and less-skilled Dingaan became king, relaxing military discipline while continuing the despotism. Dingaan also attempted to establish relations with the British traders on the Natal coast, but events had started to unfold that would see the demise of Zulu independence. 1828
The Great Trek

Meanwhile, the Boers had started to grow increasingly dissatisfied with British rule in the Cape Colony. The British proclamation of the equality of the races particularly angered them. Beginning in , several groups of Boers, together with large numbers of Khoikhoi and black servants, decided to trek off into the interior in search of greater independence. North and east of the Orange River (which formed the Cape Colony's frontier) these Boers or Voortrekkers (" Pioneers") found vast tracts of apparently uninhabited grazing lands. They had, it seemed, entered their promised land, with space enough for their cattle to graze and their culture of anti-urban independence to flourish. Little did they know that what they found - deserted pasture lands, disorganised bands of refugees, and tales of brutality - resulted from the , rather than representing the normal state of affairs. 1835 difaqane
With the exception of the more powerful Ndebele, the Voortrekkers encountered little resistance among the scattered peoples of the plains. The had dispersed them, and the remnants lacked horses and . Their weakened condition also solidified the Boers' belief that European occupation meant the coming of civilisation to a savage land. However, the mountains where King Moshoeshoe I had started to forge the Basotho nation that would later become Lesotho and the wooded valleys of Zululand proved a more difficult proposition. Here the Boers met strong resistance, and their incursions set off a series of skirmishes, squabbles, and flimsy treaties that would litter the next 50 years of increasing white domination.difaqane firearms

The Great Trek first halted at Thaba Nchu, near present-day , where the trekkers established a republic. Following disagreements among their leadership, the various Voortrekker groups split apart. While some headed north, most crossed the Drakensberg into Natal with the idea of establishing a republic there. Since the Zulus controlled this territory, the Voortrekker leader Piet Retief paid a visit to King Dingaan. The Zulus, accusing the Boers of conspiring to overthrow the Zulu state, captured Retief. After receiving the specified cattle ransom, they sent an army to decimate Retief's settlement, killing 280 Boers and 250 black servants. At the Battle of Itala, a Boer army's attempt at revenge failed miserably. The culmination came on 16 December , at the Ncome River in Natal. Though only several Boers suffered injuries, they killed several thousand Zulus. So much bloodshed reportedly caused the Ncome's waters to run red, thus the clash is historically known as the Battle of Blood River. Bloemfontein 1838

The Voortrekkers, victorious despite their numbers, saw their victory as an affirmation of divine approval. Yet their hopes for establishing a Natal republic remained short lived. The British annexed the area in , and founded their new Natal colony at present-day Durban. Most of the Boers, feeling increasingly squeezed between the British on one side and the native African populations on the other, headed north. 1843

The British set about establishing large plantations in Natal, but found few inhabitants of the neighbouring Zulu areas willing to provide labour. The British confronted stiff resistance to their encroachments from the , a nation with well-established traditions of waging war, who inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats on the British army at the Battle of Isandlwana in , where over 1400 British soldiers were killed.

The British turned to to resolve their labour shortage, as Zulu men refused to adopt the servile position of labourers and in 1860 the SS arrived in Durban harbour with over 300 people on board. Over the next 50 years, 150,000 more indentured Indians arrived, as well as numerous free "passenger Indians", building the base for what would become the largest Indian community outside of India. As early as , when arrived in Durban, Indians outnumbered whites in Natal. (See Asians in South Africa.) India Truro 1893 Mahatma Gandhi

The Boers meanwhile persevered with their search for land and freedom, ultimately establishing themselves in various Boer Republics, eg the Transvaal or South African Republic and the Orange Free State. For a while it seemed that these republics would develop into stable states, despite having thinly-spread populations of fiercely independent Boers, no industry, and minimal agriculture. The discovery of near Kimberley turned the Boers' world on its head (). The first diamonds came from land belonging to the Griqua, but to which both the Transvaal and Orange Free State laid claim. Britain quickly stepped in and resolved the issue by annexing the area for itself. diamonds 1869

Towns sprang up in which the inhabitants ignored the "proper" separation of whites and blacks, and the Boers expressed anger that their impoverished republics had missed out on the economic benefits of the mines. mines

First Anglo-Boer War
Long-standing Boer resentment turned into full-blown rebellion in the Transvaal (under British control from 1877), and the first Anglo-Boer War, known to Afrikaners as the "War of Independence", broke out in . The conflict ended almost as soon as it began with a crushing Boer victory at Battle of Majuba Hill ( 27 February ). The republic regained its independence as the (" South African Republic"), or ZAR. Paul Kruger, one of the leaders of the uprising, became President of the ZAR in . Meanwhile, the British, who viewed their defeat at Majuba as an aberration, forged ahead with their desire to federate the Southern African colonies and republics. They saw this as the best way to come to terms with the fact of a white Afrikaner majority, as well as to promote their larger strategic interests in the area. 1880 1881 Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek 1883

The influx of Black labour in particular worried the Boers, many of whom suffered economic hardship and resented the black wage-earners. 1879 1886 Johannesburg's uitlanders
The enormous wealth of the mines, largely controlled by European " Randlords" soon became irresistible for British imperialists. In , a group of renegades led by Captain Leander Starr Jameson entered the ZAR with the intention of sparking an uprising on the Witwatersrand and installing a British administration. This incursion became known as the Jameson Raid. The scheme ended in fiasco, but it seemed obvious to Kruger that it had at least the tacit approval of the Cape Colony government, and that his republic faced danger. He reacted by forming an alliance with Orange Free State. 1895

The situation peaked in when the British demanded voting rights for the 60,000 foreign whites on the Witwatersrand. Until that point, Kruger's government had excluded all foreigners from the . Kruger rejected the British demand and called for the withdrawal of British troops from the ZAR's borders. When the British refused, Kruger declared war. This lasted longer than the first, and the British preparedness surpassed that of Majuba Hill. By June , , the last of the major Boer towns, had surrendered. Yet resistance by Boer continued for two more years with guerrilla-style battles, which the British met in turn with scorched earth tactics. By 26,000 Boers had died of and neglect in concentration camps. On 31 May 1902 a superficial peace came with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging. Under its terms, the Boer republics acknowledged British sovereignty, while the British in turn committed themselves to reconstruction of the areas under their control. 1899 franchise Second Anglo-Boer War 1900 Pretoria bittereinders 1902 disease

During the immediate post-war years the British focussed their attention on rebuilding the country, in particular the mining industry. By the mines of the Witwatersrand produced almost one-third of the world's annual gold production. But the peace brought by the treaty remained fragile and challenged on all sides. The Afrikaners found themselves in the ignominious position of poor farmers in a country where big mining ventures and foreign rendered them irrelevant. Britain's unsuccessful attempts to anglicise them, and to impose English as the official language in schools and the workplace particularly incensed them. Partly as a backlash to this, the Boers came to see as the ("people's language") and as a symbol of Afrikaner nationhood. Several nationalist organisations sprang up. 1907 capital Afrikaans volkstaal
The system left Blacks and Coloureds completely marginalised. The authorities imposed harsh and reduced wages, while the British caretaker administrator encouraged the immigration of thousands of to undercut any resistance. Resentment exploded in the Bambatha Rebellion of , in which 4,000 Zulus lost their lives after protesting against onerous tax legislation. taxes Chinese 1906
The British meanwhile moved ahead with their plans for union. After several years of negotiations, the South Africa Act 1909 brought the colonies and republics - Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State - together as the Union of South Africa. Under the provisions of the act, the Union remained British territory, but with home-rule for Afrikaners. The British High Commission territories of Basutoland (now ), Bechuanaland (now ), , and Rhodesia (now and ) continued under direct rule from Britain. Lesotho Botswana Swaziland Zambia Zimbabwe
English and Dutch became the official languages. Afrikaans did not gain recognition as an official language until . Despite a major campaign by Blacks and Coloureds, the voter franchise remained as in the pre-Union republics and colonies, and only whites could gain election to parliament. 1925

The Natives' Land Act of 1913 was the first major piece of segregation legislation passed by the Union Parliament, and remained a cornerstone of Apartheid until the 1990's when it was replaced by the current policy of land restitution. Under the act, blacks were severely restricted in the ownership of land, at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. The Act created a system of land tenure that deprived the majority of South Africa's inhabitants of the right to own land which had major socio-economic repercussions.
World War I
The Union of South Africa was tied closely to the , and automatically joined with Great Britain and the allies against the German Empire. Both Prime Minister Louis Botha and Defence Minister of South Africa were part of significant military operations against Germany. In spite of Boer resistance at home, the Afrikaner-led government of Louis Botha unhestitatingly joined the side of the Allies of World War I and fought alongside its armies. The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war, and laid plans to invade German South-West Africa. Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt. The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914, and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the Maritz Rebellion. The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six-seven years and heavy fines. (See World War I and the Maritz Rebellion.) British Empire

There is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies, and Great Britain in particular, in capturing the two German colonies of German-West-Africa and German-East-Africa as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East. South Africa's ports and harbors, such as at , Durban, and Simon's Town, were also important rest-stops, refueling-stations, and served as strategic assets to the British during the war, helping to keep the vital sea lanes to the British Raj open.

World War II
Political choices at outbreak of war
On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on September 1, 1939 was none other than Barry Hertzog the leader of the pro-Afrikaner anti-British National Party that had joined in a unity government as the United Party.
Herzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against . The Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler's forces attacked Poland on the night of August 31, 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa, that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by the pro- Allied, pro-British Afrikaner, ex-General, and former Prime Minister Jan Smuts then-current Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa "neutral," if not pro- Axis.

Declaration of war against the Axis
On September 4, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in and deposed him in favour of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa, Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope. 1939 World War II
Smuts took severe action against the pro-Nazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement (they were caught committing acts of sabotage) and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war. (One of them, John Vorster, was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa.) (See Jan Smuts during World War II.)
Prime Minister and Field Marshal Smuts
Prime Minister Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister . Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. In 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall, whereas most English-speaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him.

Military contributions and casualties in World War II

Aftermath of World War II
South Africa emerged from the Allied victory with its prestige and national honor enhanced as it had fought tirelessly for the Western Allies. South Africa's standing in the international community was rising, at a time when the Third World's struggle against colonialism had still not taken centre stage. In May 1945, Prime Minister Smuts represented South Africa in at the drafting of the United Nations Charter. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international body to preserve peace; he was determined that, unlike the , the would have teeth.
