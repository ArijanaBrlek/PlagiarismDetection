About Fort Wilkins and Copper Harbor Lighthouse, Copper Harbor
Located on Lake Superior's rugged shoreline, nearly 600 miles northwest of Detroit, Fort Wilkins was once an active U.S. Army post built to keep the peace in Michigan's Copper Country.

Through Fort Wilkins' exhibits, audiovisual programs and living history interpretation, visitors may explore the daily routine of military service, experience with soldiers' families the hardships of frontier isolation and discover the lifeways of another era. Attractions include 19 restored buildings, costumed interpreters, copper mining sites, evening slide programs, camping and picnicking.
