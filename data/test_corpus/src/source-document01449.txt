Location & Topography
Oyabe City is located on the far west region of Toyama prefecture, along with Fukuoka, Tonami, Fukuno, and Fukumitsu. Oyabe City is right at the border, so it is close to Kanazawa City and Tsubata Town, both located in the neighboring Ishikawa Prefecture. The northwest region of Oyabe is hilly with Mt. Inaba (elevation of 346m) as a landmark.. The southeast region of Oyabe, also known as the grain-producing region, is ideal for cultivating rice since because of its vast plains and flatlands. The largest river through Oyabe City is Oyabe River, flowing from the south to the north (eventually emptying into the Sea of Japan).
