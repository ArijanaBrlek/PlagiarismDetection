Annuity is a financial product that tends to guarantee a safe, adjustable, and tax-advantaged return to your investment. Money invested in an annuity goes to a collective fund, which is tax-deferred, and from where after a period, you can take back your money. In this period the company uses your money to trade and take risks and your money grows at certain interest rates. Annuitization is the process of an insurance company providing you a check every year, which is drawn from your interest-accumulated taxed deferred savings lying with the company.
‘Fixed annuities’ are the ones where the interest at which your money grows is fixed. You can choose to withdraw this money in lump sum or in regular intervals. You can also choose to keep the principal amount with the company and take a fixed amount at regular intervals for life. Fixed annuities also have the option where you can be paid back for a specified number of years only. Such arrangements are beneficial for temporarily disabled persons.
Fixed annuities are useful in many ways. It provides a steady income over time. It allows handy pay-ins for medical treatments and times of emergency without loosing the benefits. It also helps to keep your taxes deferred for a large period of time. Fixed annuities are especially helpful for people whose source of income is not regular like retired persons or professionals with asymmetrical income patterns, or unwell patients. Another aspect of fixed annuities is that it can be ‘qualified’ or ‘nonqualified’, depending on whether tax has been paid for the money used to buy the annuity contract. If it is pre-taxed money then you don’t get a tax-deferred status.
