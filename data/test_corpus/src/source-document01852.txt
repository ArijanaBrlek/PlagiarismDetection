- The larva (caterpillar) hatches from an egg and eats leaves or flowers almost constantly. The caterpillar molts (loses its old skin) many times as it grows.Larva
- It turns into a pupa (chrysalis); this is a resting stage.Pupa
- A beautiful, flying adult emerges. There is no growth during this stage. This adult will continue the cycle and reproduce.Adult
