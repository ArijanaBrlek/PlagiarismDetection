Bloomington Second Indiana City to Provide Gender Identity Protections. Bloomington has become the second Indiana city to provide civil-rights protections based on gender identity. This change means that Bloomington city code will treat "gender identity" as a category protected against discrimination, just like race, religion, disability, sex and sexual orientation. The Bloomington City Council vote was preceded by two years of broad community advocacy. The April 19, 2006 vote by the Bloomington City Council provides for voluntary mediation to address complaints of gender-identity discrimination. The ordinance also allows the Bloomington Human Rights Commission (BHRC) to pursue gender-identity complaints selectively as sex-discrimination complaints, with the power to  enforce compliance.April 19, 2006--Bloomington, IN--

from the National Center for Transgender Equality:  The House of Representatives is currently considering H.R. 418, the REAL ID Act. Ask Your Representatives to vote AGAINST the REAL ID Act (H.R. 418). This bill establishes requirements for state IDs that all states must abide by and mandates categories that must be present on state IDs.  Gender is one of those mandated categories.  Although no rules would be established regarding the process of changing gender markers, any national regulations regarding state IDs are dangerous for civil rights.  The REAL ID Act would infringe upon civil liberties in a number of other ways, including preventing states from issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, and limiting the groups of lawful immigrants who can obtain licenses.  Many Representatives have spoken in opposition to his bill.  The full House will vote on the bill is expected to take place TODAY, February 10th.Please call your House members immediately and ask them to vote AGAINST the REAL ID Act (H.R. 418).  The House of Representatives Switchboard number is (202) 224-3121.
