Many elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function. One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive, so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce. [1]
Relatively large quantities of are required, but there is no RDA, as the sulfur is obtained from and used for , and therefore should be adequate in any diet containing enough protein. sulfur [6] amino acids
is required in the synthesis of , but because bacteria are required to synthesize the , it is usually considered part of rather than its own mineral deficiency. Cobalt vitamin B12 vitamin vitamin B12 deficiency
There have been occasional studies asserting the essentiality of , but it currently has no known RDA. nickel [7]
is sometimes described as essential. It is implicated in sugar metabolism in humans, leading to a market for the supplement, , but definitive biochemical evidence for a physiological function is lacking. Chromium [8] [9] chromium picolinate [10]
has been described as conditionally essential, depending upon the importance placed upon the prevention of chronic disease. Fluoride [11] [12]
