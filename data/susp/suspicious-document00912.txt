took shape in 1920, when a group of seventeen flutists met at the home of Georges Barrere Kuhlau Quartet to play the Great. Barrere was then the principal flutist of the New York
Symphony
Orchestra and teaches flute at the

Juilliard School). The club was officially founded by the state of New York December 31, 1920, and held

Stringfield.
