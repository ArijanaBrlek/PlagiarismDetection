Poker has got its own alien language that makes some of us all say What was that he was talking about? If they developed any more words they should be creating their own dictionary. For us na ve but interested in playing poker here are some of the words that they use.
Blinds  can either be small or big. These are not your 3 little blind mice kind of thingy. These are the required bets that are needed to be made before cards are dealt. Instead of paying penalties when you lose, they made it to a reward, to be more positive. The small blind is paid by the person on the left of the dealer and the big blind is paid by the person next to him.
Board cards  cards that are in the middle of the table that are shared by other players.
Draw  you hope that your hand will improve with the set of cards that will come out of the board cards. If you have two cards that are of the same suit (i.e. clover) and the flop cards are 3 clover, 10 clover and King of hearts. You would wish that the draw on the turn or river will be any card that is also a clover to get a flush.
Flop  the first three cards that come out on the board table. (Texas Hold Em type of poker)
Preflop  when you only have two cards and no cards are on the board yet.
Turn  the fourth card that comes after the flop(Texas Hold Em type of poker)
River  the fifth and final card that comes after the turn(Texas Hold Em type of poker)
Pot odds  the odds you have when you are drawing.
Limit Poker  poker that has fixed bets that ranges usually for 2 to 4 dollars. The raises will also be only 2 dollars in the preflop and flop rounds. The bets and raises will then be 4 dollars on the final two rounds.
Long hand  this is not the term for cheaters. This is the term for poker games that have 7 or more people.
Short hand  not a poker game for midgets. This is a poker game with 6 or less poker players.
Outs  the number of cards that can help improve your cards. This is a mathematical thing. If you have cards that are 10 & 9 and the flop is queen, jacks and 2. To be able to have a straight you would need either an 8 or a king and there are for of each kind of these cards in the deck. Therefore your outs are 8.
Position  the place where you sit at the poker table. Dealers always have the best position because he always bets last and therefore he will have a better understanding of what the other players have. The person who goes frit or the small blind has the worst position.
