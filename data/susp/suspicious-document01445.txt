Fact: For the nation, direct unemployment numbers will reach 239,000 and total employment losses will exceed 2.9 million!
Fact: Job losses and economic impacts of this scale will lead to horrific social conditions beyond unemployment, foreclosures, personal bankruptcies, and homelessness. Time and time again, we all have witnessed the increases in deep social challenges during hard economic times including domestic violence, suicide, drug use and the list goes on.

Sure we have to take on the blame of not making cars that people will buy, for not exceeding fuel efficiency standards, for accepting and encouraging unsustainable contracts and for the arrogance of leaders believing that we are entitled somehow to a cash bailout without a plan. But now this crisis is before us and simply saying that the Big Three deserve to fail is like pointing fingers at the bow of a hole-ridden, leaking boat and blaming the lake for rushing in. We need to plug the holes, bail out the water and redesign the boat lest we all drown!
