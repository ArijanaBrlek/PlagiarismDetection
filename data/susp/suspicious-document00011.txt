Shakespeare is one of the most famous works of Renaissance literature. The drama of this game comes to problems identified by one family. The problems of the wider community is seen through the eyes, the actions and thought of family members. A ruler has the power, and a lot of actions are related to questions about the nature of that power.

For example, she was mad song "cue words" (such as,,,,), encouraged the audience "suspect misfortune" (24). As was common during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Shakespeare borrowed for his plays ideas and stories from earlier literary works. He could have taken the story of Hamlet from several possible sources, including a 1100s Latin history of Denmark compiled by Saxo Grammaticus and a prose work by the French writer Franois de Bell Forest, entitled16001601Hamlet160216031604Histoires Tragiques. The raw material
that Shakespeare dedicating
writing Hamlet is the
story of a Danish prince
whose uncle murders prince's father, marries his mother and claim the throne.
The prince
pretends to be feeble-minded to throw his uncle off guard, and then manages to kill his uncle revenge. Shakespeare changed the emphasis of this story entirely, making his Hamlet a philosophically minded prince who delays taking action because his knowledge of his uncle's crime is so uncertain.

"Fourth edition of Hamlet is instrumental in, his mother to the buses, which effectively reverses what happens in the next issue, where almost hates her, she shows no mercy and see his zeal, especially as a symbol of the promiscuity of all things now on Satan seems to be the driving force behind every action." In the dark, talking Ghost, who claims to be his father's Ghost, Hamlet wake his death a "very evil and unnatural murder" revenge (iv). Hamlet is shocked by the revelation that his father was murdered, and the spirit tells him when he slept in their garden, they poured a villain poison in his ear-the very bad guy who wears his Crown, now.  However, his solemn theory in grief and anger, when he saw the explosion Ophelia's funeral procession, Laertes his attacks provided a glimpse of his true feelings had been for Ophelia. Ophelia dead in the warm embrace of Laertes into the subtle pattern again, hanging on their brothers and sisters incest. Interestingly, the "Hamlet" has never said
that the death of Ophelia, he indirectly caused by his murder of guilt. In fact, the only time he even close to the Bolognese Seoul's death responsibility, all in one and the last scene with Laertes duel before he apologized, and accused him of "crazy" the death of Polonius. Understand the physical connection between these two monologues is a mistake, however, to align with the core of work, constantly renewed, but more in Act III, through the dark night of the soul. It seems that even Olivier could not fully understand the purpose of deepening this compilation monologues. (Actually, I'm sure he did it, but to conclude that, for the stage (and with great difficulty) simply is not on the
screen to work.) There
are, however,
certain that something is wrong: the demotic word "method", (derived from demotics "system" is rapidly all vocabulary), the logic seems compelling line through the operation of the technical impossibility to convey the idea that, although canceled only 3 minutes has elapsed
then the Auditorium, a Sleepless Night becomes the whole character and foot scene The scene is used to develop the character of Polonius, who is one of the most fascinating figures of Hamlet. Polonium can be
interpreted as a madman or a manipulator get tricky, and has performed on stage at a time. What is this scene as instructed carefully Reynaldo in the art of espionage, the manipulator seems silly, but his love for your own voice leads some comic strip misphrasings ("and therefore, Mr President, a it ya-/ that I was about to say mass was about to say something / where to go out" [II.)I. -]?.?) 4951 in his advice to Reynaldo, Polonius explicitly develops something Hamlet, the idea that words can be used to bend and alter the truth. At this stage, Claudio decided clearly that he can appease the anger of Laertes and Hamlet distribute a bulkhead, knocking the idea of duel use fury Laertes to ensure the death of Hamlet. The
resulting
plan gives both the theme of vengeance and the repeated use of traps in the field to a new height, Laertes and Claudius boil not one but three mechanisms that hidden Hamlet can die. The tragic death of Ofelia
occurs at the worst possible moment for Claudio. Laertes flees the room in anguish after Claudius, not the console or even to join him in a duel, but because it tells Gertrude, was as hard to appease his wrath
in the first place.
Claudius doesn't have time to worry about the victims of the tragedy, is too busy to deal with the threat to his power. When he speaks, he sounds as if he is saying, maybe he does not even know about something important. Write soliloquies and dialogues that most of Shakespeare's
