Danville National Cemetery was established in December 1866 on a plot of 2.6 acres (11,000 m). Almost all of the original interments were prisoners of war that were held in the nearby prisoner of war camp. Most of the bodies were initially buried in poorly marked, mass graves, but were later exhumed and buried with individual markers.2 Union Confederate
