Archytas
Archytas is believed to be the founder of mathematical . As only described in the writings of five centuries after him, he was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam, said to have actually flown some 200 meters. This machine, which its inventor called , may have been suspended on a wire or pivot for its flight. Archytas also wrote some lost works, as he was included by in the list of the twelve authors of works of mechanics. Thomas Winter has suggested that the pseudo-Aristotelian is an important mechanical work by Archytas, not lost after all, but misattributed. mechanics [1] Aulus Gellius [2] [3] The Pigeon [4] [5] Vitruvius [6] Mechanical Problems [7]
According to , Archytas solved the problem of in his manner with a geometric construction. before, reduced this problem to finding mean . Archytas' theory of proportions is treated in book VIII of 's , where is the construction for two proportional means, equivalent to the extraction of the . According to , this demonstration, which uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes, was the first in which geometry was studied with concepts of mechanics. The , which he used in his solution of the doubling the cube problem, is named after him.

Politically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to in a half-century earlier. The Tarentines elected him , 'general', seven years in a row a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. He was allegedly undefeated as a general, in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors. The of asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with of . In his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato's , and that he influenced Plato's political philosophy as expressed in and other works (i.e., how does a society obtain good rulers like Archytas, instead of bad ones like Dionysus II?).

The is created by placing a semicircle (with a diameter of d) on the diameter of one of the two circles of a cylinder (which also has a diameter of d) and then rotating the semicircle about the cylinder's diameter. This rotation will cut out a portion of the cylinder forming the Archytas Curve. Another, less mathematical, way of thinking of this construction is that the Archytas Curve is basically the result of cutting out a hemisphere of diameter d out of a cylinder also of diameter d. A cone can go through the same procedures also producing the Archytas Curve. Archytas used his curve to determine the construction of a cube with a volume of half of that of a given cube.Archytas Curve
