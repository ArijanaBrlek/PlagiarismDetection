hemoglobin, the oxygen is transported in the blood to various
parts of the body. It also plays a vital role
in many metabolic reactions. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia resulting in a low level of hemoglobin in the blood. Iron deficiency is the most common mineral nutrients In the UK and around the world. Functional iron is essential to the formation of
hemoglobin, the red pigment in the blood.

human body (iron deficiency), but also deprived of infectious organisms are needed this crucial element of their survival and growth. Storage of iron content affect iron absorption. Iron absorption, low body reserves. When high iron stores, in order to reduce iron overload [interception] the poisoning to help stop. Dietary

Because the iron in vivo depleted storage in General, there is a certain limit the body can not handle (around 100mg per day), a

British omnivorous women showed that on average,

nutritional survey of British adults
showed that one-third of the women had low iron levels.
Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue
and shortness of breath, especially during physical exertion, dizziness, heart palpitations, headaches and poor concentration. Babies, toddlers, preschoolers and adolescents are at greater risk of iron deficiency due to increased iron needs can not be satisfied if their diet is not balanced. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in children starts with
diet change, but may include iron supplements (under medical supervision only). Date: Better
Health Channel Description: Causes of
iron deficiency in adults include inadequate dietary intake, chronic blood

causes), periods of increased need such as pregnancy, inability to absorb or use iron properly and vigorous exercise. I am a former employee of Wellsphere. Robin Perryville, Missouri Hello!
