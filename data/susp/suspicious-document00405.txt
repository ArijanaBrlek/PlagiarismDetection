Franchising vs taxes
Â 
PricewaterhouseCoopers in cooperation with MTP will hold a seminar discussing the following subjects: franchise fees and cooperation with suppliers.
Payment of franchise fees entails tax consequences for both the franchisor as well as the payer (franchisee). Therefore, it is of major importance to precisely define the payment structure (are the fees included in the goods prices or paid separately) and the services for which the fees apply (e.g. licence, know-how, marketing support, etc.). Having this information allows for proper classification of the payments themselves, necessary documents confirming relevance of these expenses, and definition of correct tax implications. During the meeting, key elements of franchise fees will be indicated, proper determination of which will allow both the franchisee and the franchisor to classify them safely for taxation purposes.Franchise fees
It is impossible to develop one's business operations without cooperation with suppliers and contracting partners. Such cooperation is inherently related to payment to such contractors of different types of additional payments. These may include payment for services provided, have the form of discounts, money bonuses or be the so-called "shelf fees". Recording of these payments and related determination of correct tax implications is frequently a source of doubts of tax-payers and the constantly changing approach of tax authorities. During the meeting, we shall indicate the key features of payments deciding on their tax classification and correct recording method.Cooperation with suppliers
