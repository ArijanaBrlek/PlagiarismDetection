[] edit Characters
Janis
A human girl from the modern era who becomes friends with Kagome in the game. Janis is an American and is the reincarnation of the daughter of the god, Datara. She follows Kagome one day after school and is attacked by a demon who emerges from the Bone Eater's Well. Rescued by the mysterious Monk Sen, Janis follows his advice to follow Kagome to the feudal era through the well. After passing through, she meets Kagome and her friends and discovers that the Sacred Jewel shard has awakened her Kamui powers. She agrees to accompany them on their journey until she is able to remove the Jewel Shard from her body.
Lord Gorai
The infamous Lord of the Northern Lands. He is a powerful demon who sought the Demon Mask 500 years before the main storyline, and used the mask to control the god Datara. After an encounter with InuYasha's group, Gorai grants them safe passage through the mountains and allows them to reawaken the dormant Datara. With the god as his slave, he plans to steal Datara's Kamui powers. Gorai and his forces attacked and destroyed many human villages, but his units are wiped out by Naruku's demon puppets. After a brief battle with InuYasha and his friends, Gorai was defeated and injured. Naraku stepped in to distract InuYasha with his Demon Puppets, thus allowing Gorai to escape. The Demon Lord played into Naraku's plans to steal Datara's Kamui by allowing Gorai to steal the Kamui first, and then taking it from him. Both Gorai's and Naraku's plans are eventually thwarted by InuYasha's group, and Datara was freed from his control.
Sara
Known for using a spell to control humans, Sara is a powerful female demon. Despite leading a small army of her demon minions, she can be somewhat overconfident in her own abilities. After her battle with InuYasha's team (accompanied by Janis), Sara retreated. Her serious injuries led her to the New Moon Cave, which opens only on the night of the New Moon. Despite it being the Night of the New Moon, the human InuYasha and his group entered the demon-infested cave and encountered Sesshomaru. Knowing of their presence, Sara captured Kagome, Sango, Miroku, Shippo, and Kirara. She succeeded in stealing the Sea God's Kamui, but was confronted by Sesshomaru. He and Janis temporarily joined forces to destroy Sara, and return the Sea God's Kamui.
