TANGIBLE PROPERTY
Tangible personal property is physical property, usually movable, that has value and utility in and of itself (examples: trade tools, fixtures, office equipment, inventory). In determining whether an item is real property or tangible personal property, the following aspects must be considered:
The manner in which the item is fixed or attached to the real estate.
The intention of the party who attached the item.
The purpose for which the premises are used.
Generally, items remain personal property if they can be removed without damage to the real estate or to the item itself. Machinery bolted to the floor to prevent movement while in operation would remain personal property. If the machinery were built into the building in such a manner that its removal would produce considerable damage to the building, it would be part of the real estate.
